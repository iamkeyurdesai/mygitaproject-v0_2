12,"| Srimad Bhagavadgita holds an incomparable and unique
position in world literature. It recalls the divine voice of Lord
Krsna, through which many of His mysteries and inner secrets
are revealed. In communicating these for the benefit of mankind,
the Lord has invoked Arjuna, as an interlocutor or questioner.
The small book, full of the Lord’s extraordinary thoughts and
views from the very heart, was never excelled in the past, nor
would ever be, in the future. .
Our revered Param Shraddheya Shri Swami
Ramsukhdasji has delved deep into the bottomless depths
| of this profound scripture and extracted invaluable gems,
which in his magnanimity, he has through his commentary
in Hindi, called 'Sadhaka Safijivani offered for the. benefit
and spiritual advancement of aspirants. It is obvious that
. this commentary. is singularly different and ‘distinctive, in
many respects, from other publications. Though we claim
no far-reaching study of other critiques and annotations,
yet we are struck by new interpretations, new meanings
and new revelations in this commentary, arising from many
verses, such as; Chapter one—Verses: ten, nineteen, twenty
‘and twenty-five; Chapter two—Verses: thirty-nine and forty;
Chapter three—Verses: three, ten, twelve, thirteen and forty-
three; Chapter four—eighteen and thirty-eight; Chapter five—
Verses: thirteen and fourteen; Chapter six—Verses: twenty
and thirty-eight; Chapter seven—Verses: five and nineteen:
. Chapter eight —Verse: six; Chapter nine—Verses: three and
thirty-one: Chapter ten—Verse: forty-one; Chapter eleven—
Verses: twenty-six, twenty-seven, forty-five and forty-six;
Chapter twelve—Verse: twelve; Chapter thirteen—Verses:
one, nineteen, twenty and twenty-one; Chapter fourteen—
Verses: three, twelve, seventeen and twenty-two; Chapter

13,"IV . SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA

fifteen—Verses: seven and eleven; Chapter sixteen—Verses: five
and twenty; Chapter seventeen—Verses: seven and ten; Chapter
eighteen—Verses: thirty-seven and seventy-three, etc.

We are confident that with an in-depth study of the
commentary, aspirants would discover many different facets
and resolutions, from these and other verses, for their better
understanding and help in forging ahead with their Sadhana.

In the present times, unfortunately, there is a dearth of books,
which would in simple language and with lucidity, explain and
delineate the correct path and milestones of an aspirant's progress,
and this void often results in their predicament. Therefore, the
publication of a detailed commentary, in plain words and simple
style with clarity and offering elucidation and explanation, such
as this work, is at once a most welcome and important step. -

Swamiji Maharaj's commentary is apparently, neither intended
to promote a new or particular philosophical viewpoint, nor in
the least, a means to display learning; but that it should and
would act as a life-giving boon, like the Safijivant herb, for all
aspirants, no matter which creed, faith, religion, or language
or place, they belong to. The Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, Muslim,
Christian and others etc; in studying this book, would discover

| in it, a basis for their advancement, in accordance with and

| supportive of the tenets of their individual faiths or religions and
they would find enough material in this book, to help achieve
their spiritual goals. |

To gain spiritual bliss, we humbly urge aspirants to study
the commentary deeply and sincerely, understand the writing
and endeavour to put into practise the contents, for their own
forward progress in the world.

"
14,"Srimad Bhagavadgita-Sadhaka Saiijivani—with commentary
by Param Shraddheya Shri Ramsukhdasji Maharaj in its English
version has, on all hands, been an outstanding and much
appreciated exposition of the divine and immortal work. It has
been reprinted before and is now ready for another printing.
Time was, therefore, opportune for a revision of this masterly
analytical and exhaustive commentary, so that, if necessary, clarify
and amplify comments in order to enhance its understanding and
gainful usefulness. |

The result may be called a revision or a mere new work.
It is a revision, in as much it retains the basic concept, approach
and arguments of the first edition. What is new, however, is
the elucidation and precise explanation of some comments
in English, in order to eliminate any possible ambiguity or loss
of clarity. It is in this light that changes made must be read.
The amendments are unpretentious, and are intended to make
reading easy.

The book is, at the same time, somewhat new, in as much
as, an opportunity has been taken, importantly, to include—with
the approval of the author, Param Shraddheya Shn Ramsukhdasji
Maharaj—two additional and valuable appendices at the end of
the commentary on the Gita. The first Appendix entitled, ""A
bird's eyeview of the Gita"", is a summarised essence of the
scripture, highlighting its core and offering a capsulised version
for quick comprehension and ready reference. The second
Appendix, covers the traditional and other suggested ""Methods
of Recitation of the Gita"", to help devotees to seek and achieve
spiritual benefit of worship, through the Gita. Both these
sections were authored by Param Shraddheya Shri Ramsukhdasji

Maharaj and originally mcluded in his monumental and celebrated
book, ""The Gita Darpana—The Gita A Mirror"", and published
by the Gita Press.

The Publishers are confident that the changes effected, would
make this revised edition of the Bhagavadgita-Sadhaka Saijivani
of greater interest to the English readers and would be acclaimed
by them. This edition makes it still more comprehensive, more
meaningful and beneficial, for aspirants of spiritual elevation, as
to students of the Gita, as well as to the perspicacious members
of different creeds and faiths, idealogies and religions interested

: in this unique and secular publication—-The words of God.

May, the publishers urge the readers to study this revised
edition of the Gita, with deep profundity and put into creative

The word 'Yoga' of the Gita is pregnant with many wondrous
meaning. We can place these under three heads: |

(i) Derived from the root ""Yujir Yoge’ (af a1) the word
‘yoga’ has the implied meaning—eternal kinship with equanimous
(aqeq) God; as in 'Samatvath yoga ucyate' (2.48) etc. This
meaning has importance in thé Gita. |

(ii) Originating from the root ""Yuj Samadhau', the word ‘yoga’,
implies—stability of citta i.e., a state of trance during meditation;

| as in 'Yatroparamate cittarh niruddharh yogasevaya’ (6.20) etc.

(iii) Deduced from the root ""Yuj Sarhyamane’, the word ‘yoga’
means—controling power, divine prowess, magnetic impact; as
in 'Pasya me yogamaiswaram' (9.5) etc.

Wherever the word 'Yoga’ has appeared 1n the Gita, it has
in it the primacy of one of the aforesaid three meanings, the
other two meanings having a secondary place only. As in the
word ‘yoga’ derived from ‘yujir yoge’, there 1s the predominance
of the meaning of equanimity, though on realization of
equanimity, meditational stability and divine prowess* also accrue
automatically. In the word ‘yoga’ from ""Yuj samadhau', there is
the supermacy of transcendental stability, but on achievement of
this state, equanimity and prowess follow, automatically. In the
word ‘yoga’ from ""Yuj Sarhyamane’, there is the dominance of
divine prowess and majesty, but on realization of this prowess,
equanimity and stability also, follow suit on their own. Thus the
word ‘yoga’ of the Gita has very pervasive and profound meanings.
universe which belongs only to God—that power the Yogi does ‘not acquire—Jagadvyap
aravarjam (Brahmasiitra 4.4.17). The power which a Yogi gains, enables him to conquer
nature (Gitd 5.19), meaning that no amount of favourable or unfavourable circumstances,
can in anyway affect him.
"
19,"XIV SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA

In the YogadarSana of Sage Patanjah, the word ‘yoga’ is the
name given to the control of cittavrttis (mental tendencies and
mind-stuff) from taking various forms—'Y ogascittavrttinirodhah’'
(1.2) and the effect of that yoga has been pointed out, as the
lodgement of drasta (the witness) in one’s own self: ""Tada
Drastuh svarupe'vasthanam’ (1.3). In this way, the very result
of Yoga as depicted in the Yoga-DarSsana of Patafijali has been
given the name ‘yoga’ in the Gita (2.48; 6.23). The implication
is, that the self-proved natural state of equanimity totally cut
off from the cittavrttis, is called 'yoga’ by the Gita. On realizing
lodgement in equanimity, (eternal unison—Nityayoga), there is
never a disunion or deviation from it. There is a desireless
transcendental state, (nirvikalpa avasthd) when there is control
over mental tendencies. But on realization of equanimity there
is 'desireless transcendental awareness 'nirvikalpavastha.' This
‘desireless transcendental awareness— nirvikalpa bodha—is the
illuminator of statelessness, as well as, of other states.

For a seeker to have experience of equanimity or eternal
unison, three yoga-ways have been expounded in the Gitéa—the
Path of Action, the Path of Knowledge and the Path of Devotion.
There is an inalienable relationship of the three bodies—the
gross, the subtle and the causal,—with the world. To, employ
these three, in the service of others—is the Path of Action. The
realization of one's identity and lodgement within one's own
self, after dissociating from these, it is the Path of Knowledge;
and surrendering one's self to God—is the Path of Devotion.
In order to accomplish these yogas, and attain one's salvation,
man is endowed, with three powers (i) power to act (strength),
(11) power to know (knowledge), and (ill) power to believe
(faith). The power to act is for rendering service to the world
selflessly—that is Karmayoga; the power to know, is meant for
Self realisation—that is Jnanayoga; and the power to believe, is
"
20,"Unfathomable and illimitable is the glory of Smad Bhagavad

Gita. This holy book, the Bhagavad Gita, is counted among the —
scriptural trio, the 'Prasthana Traya’. The three royal ways of
welfare of mankind, are known by the name of Prasthana Traya:
one is the ""Vedic Prasthana’ called the Upanisad; the second is
| metaphysical or Philosophical Prasthana’ called the Brahma Sitra;
and the third is, 'Smarta Prasthana', called the Bhagavad Gita.
_ There are ‘Mantras’ (mystical rubrics), in the Upanisads., 'siitras’
(aphorisms) in the Brahma Sitra and ‘slokas' (verses), in the
Bhagavad Gita. Though the Bhagavad Gita has only Slokas', yet
these being the very voice of God, are verily mantras. Pregnant,
as the Slokas are with meaning and import of great profundity,
| these can be called ‘sutras’ also. The Upanisads are of use and
value for the deserving only, and the Brahma Siitras, are of
use and importance for men of erudition and learning, but the

Bhagavad Gita is for, one and all. |

The Bhagavad Gita is a most unusual and many facetted
scripture. It contains highly useful and detailed material for a
seeker, be he of any country, costume, community, disposition,
creed, ‘varna’ or any ‘asrama’' (station), in life. It is so, because
_ there is in it, neither denunciation nor praise of any creed or
denomination, in particular; instead it deals with the essence of
pure Reality only. Pure Reality (the Supreme Lord or Paramatma),
as that which is wholly beyond change in Nature and the nature-.
born things and is ever-eternally immutable and uniform, in the
midst of the flux in space, time, things, being, circumstance etc.
Real 'Tattva’, (essence), is ever-present in its perfect form, in
each man, wherever and however, he is. But that is not realized
"
21,"X SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA
because of attachment and aversion—raga and dvesa—born of
the changeable nature of things in a person. Only on achieving
complete freedom from attachment and aversion, it is automatically
realized and with ease. |
The teachings of Bhagavad Gita are singularly divine.
: Numerous commentaries have been written on it and several more
are being written, yet new and fresh ideas continue to surge,
| in the hearts and minds of saints, seers and sages, of wisdom.
However much thought may be given to this. profound Song
Celestial, the meaning and deeper implications thereof, none can
fathom in their entirety. The deeper they delve into it, the more
profound the meanings are to be found, therein. When the range
of the finer emotions of a learned person is not easily judged
how can then the magnitude of emotions encased in the words of
God, whose forms and names are infinite, be ever assumed?
There is such a uniqueness in this small-sized work, that
a real seeker of one's salvation (Kalyana) irrespective of varna,
asrama, nationality, creed, belief etc., is at once attracted by
the mere study of this treatise. If a man reads and grasps, even
a little, from this sacred book, several satisfying disciplines or
ways, become available to him for his life's fulfilment. Different _
authorities exist for the study of respective systems of philosophy,
but the unique significance of the Gita, is that all the seekers of
salvation are eligible for its study. | |
In explaining different disciplines (sadhana), and in
communicating the meanings in detail, no hesitaion was felt in
repeating matters about each discipline in the Bhagavad Gita,
and yet its size has not increased unduly. No single holy book
of wisdom exists, which expounds the full import of Reality with
| such. precision and prolification. A man with intense yearning for
- his ‘kalyana’ (goal) can realize Godhead, the Supreme Truth, in

to totally surrender to God, after regarding God as one’s own
and one's own self, as God's—this is Bhaktiyoga. He, in whom
interest to act dominates, is qualified to adopt the Path of Action.
He, in whom inquisitiveness for Self-realisation dominates, is
eligible and qualified, for the Path of Knowledge. He, in whom
faith and belief in God dominates, is qualified for the Path of
Devotion. All these three Yoga-paths. are independent means
of God-realization. All other means are also implicit in these
three paths.* | a : :

The main object of all the paths, is to accomplish separation
from non-self. However, there does remain a difference in
these disciplines in attaining separation, but after completing
this breach with matter (non-self), all means lead to realization
of one equanimous; supreme Godhead. This very realization of
‘Paramatmatattva’, the Gita has called ""Yoga’; and verily, this is
called, 'Nityayoga'—the Eternal Union. —

It is not right, that there has been given only a description,
in the Gita of Karmayoga, Jiianayoga, or of Bhaktiyoga. Besides

_ . these three yogas, there is a description of yajfia (sacrifice), dana
(charity), tapa (penance), dhyanayoga (yoga of meditation),
_ pranayama (control of breath), hathayoga (austere discipline of

| body etc.), layayoga (yoga of rhythmic unison) etc. The reason

""Y ogastrayo maya prokta nrnar Sreyovidhitsaya; jiianam karma cabhaktisca:

seekers eager for their welfare: those of knowledge, action ard devotion. There
is nowhere, any other way of total well-being.""

for it is, that Arjuna's questions in the Gita are not about war,
but really about salvation. Lord Krsna's purpose in discoursing |
this Gita was not the conduct of war. Arjuna definitely wanted
his salvation (2.7; 3.2; 5.1). Therefore, as many means of his |
welfare, which have been reflected in the scriptures, have been
| with precision, detailed in the Gita. Keeping in view all. those
means, the Gita is specially held in high esteem; the reason being,
that a seeker might belong to any belief, creed, or doctrine, but _
one's salvation is indeed, dear and open to all. |
In a ‘Jiva' (being)—there is an 'amSa' (element) of the
Conscious God and an ‘arhSa' of the inert nature (prakrti). By
the dominance of the Conscious-part, one seeks God; and by the
dominance of the inert part, he desires the world. Between these
two, the yearning for God could be satisfied, but the desires of
the world are never fulfilled. Some worldly desires seemingly
fulfilled are never satiated, but owing to worldly attachment, ever
_ new desires arise. In fact, the satisfaction of worldly desires or
| achievement of worldly objects, is not within the authority of
desire, but is subject to karma. God-realization is not under the
power of karma, and it is attained by the intense longing of one's
own Self. Its reason is, that each karma (act), has a beginning and
an end; so the result too is bound to have a beginning and an
end. How can then a beginningless and endless God, be realized
by karmas, which are origin and end bound? But seekers have
often understood, that as the worldly objects are achieved by
the predominance of activities, so also the realization of God
would be achievable through the dominance of activity. As the
assistance of body, senses, mind and intellect, has to be taken
in achieving the objects of the world, so also in God-realization,
the assistance of body, senses, mind, intellect will have to be
"
24,", SADHAKA-SANJIVANI XVII
called for, they argue. Therefore, such seekers practise spiritual
discipline, erroneously with the help of their inert body etc., to
realize God. | |

By practising the Yoga of Meditation for a long time, i.e.,
gradually fixing one's mind on God, when the 'citta' (mind) gets
controlled, having no worldly attachment and being incapable
of realising God, due to inertness, it becomes unconcerned
with the world. On the citta (mind) becoming unconcerned, the
seeker becomes completely cut off from the mind or inertness,
and he gains experience of Godhead automatically (Gita 6.20).
But a seeker, who having accepted his axiomatic and eternal
unison with God, from the beginning without accepting in the

~ Jeast, his kinship with inert matter, traverses the course of his
discipline, he experiences the Supreme Tattva (essence) early,
and with ease. | : |

Thus, for seekers who wish to realize God, there are two
disciplines or ways of seeking Him. The discipline, in which
there remains dominance of ‘antahkarana’ (the inner faculty)
i.e., wherein a seeker observes discipline with the assistance of
matter which goes by the name of 'karana sapeksa salt’. (Discipline
aided by the Inner faculty). The second discipline, in which
the seeker, from the very beginning, follows the discipline by
himself, without the assistance of matter, is called, 'Karana
Nirapeksa Saili' (Discipline unaided by the Inner faculty). God-
realization, in both these disciplines, takes place only by Karana
Nirapeksata 1.e., by one’s own self (after a complete breach with
matter). Realization via 'Karana Sapeksa Saili' comes very late,
whereas it happens immediately, through 'Karana Nirapeksa Sailf.
There are four main differences, between these two disciplines
of seeking God.

(i) Assistance of matter, (body-senses-mind-intellect) has to
"
25,"XV SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA

be taken in the 'Karana Sapeksa Sailr’, but no such assistance is
necessary, in the ‘Karana Nirapeksa Saili’, instead the assumed
relationship with matter, is to be sundered or broken up. _

(ii) There is, creation of a new state of mind in the 'Karana
Sapeksa Saili’, but there is realization after breach with all states
of mind in the 'Karana Nirapeksa Sailt’. |

(iii) There is, in the discipline aided by the instrument, (‘Karana
Sapeksa Saili’) an acquisition of occult powers (siddhis), but

. in the discipline unaided by the instrument, (Karana Nirapeksa
- Saili,) there is a direct and intuitive experience of Reality, on
severance of relationship with matter.* — |

(iv) God-realization, in the ‘discipline aided by the inner .

faculty’ is never immediate, but in the ‘discipline unaided by the
| Instrument’ God-realization (siddhi) is immediate, as soon as a
breach with matter is complete, either after surrendering to God,
| or on being established in the self. |
- In the Yogadarsana of Patafijali, importance is given to -
‘discipline aided by the antahkarana' in the realization of yoga,
but in the Gita, importance is attached only to ‘discipline unaided
by the faculty’, in the realization of yoga (armfafg). It is alright
if the mind gets tuned to God, but if it is not so tuned, then
_ _*Ifit were possible to have direct God-realization with the ‘Discipline aided
by Instrument’ (Cittavrttinirodha), then the ""Vibhuti-Pada' (wherein ‘Siddhis’ are
described) of Patafijali's YogadarSana, would have been futile. Those 'siddhis' or
powers, which are acquired by the ‘Discipline Aided By Instrument’, are hurdles
in the path of God-realization. Even in the Patafijali YogadarSana, the ‘siddhis’
are regarded as obstacles—'Te samadhavupasarga vyutthane siddhayah’ (3.37)
i.e., these (siddhis) are obstacles in the attainment of Samadhi and are ‘powers’ _
during 'Vyutthana' (behavioural) world; ‘Sthanyupanimantrane sahgasmayakaranam
punaranistaprasangat (3.51) i.e.,on being called by the gods guarding the directions,
(by offering temptations of the enjoyments of their realms), neither should one
have attachment for them, nor should one take pride in them; because in doing so,
there is again a possibility of the loss of realization (anista) or a fall.
"
26,"SADHAKA-SANJIVANI XIX
nothing happens—this is the basis of the ‘discipline, aided by
the inner faculty’. Whether or not, mind is attuned to God, it
does not matter; but one's self should be attached to God—this
reflects the ‘discipline unaided by the inner faculty’. The import
and implication of all this is, that, in the 'Karana Nirapeksa Sailr’,
there is direct relation of the self with God, with a total breach
of ties, with the mind intellect complex. Therefore, realization
in the 'Karana Sapeksa Saili' is affirmed by practice, but there
is no need for any other steps, in the 'Karana Nirapeksa Sail’.
The reason is that, there is ‘axiomatic eternal union’ (nitya
yoga) with God. Thus, there is no necessity of any practice in
believing or knowing, one's unitive relation with God; just as
on accomplishment of marriage, when a woman accepts a man
as her husband, she needs to do nothing further, in so believing.
So also, on being told by someone that. ‘here is Gangaji' no
further exercise is to be done, even to realise it.* In the 'Karana
Nirapeksa Saili', The primacy is only of knowing (viveka) and
believing (bhava). If one says, 'T have no relation with inertness
(body etc.) at all'—even without such an experience, if a seeker
firmly believes in this from the very outset, then also such a
realization, clearly dawns upon him. As he was in bondage under
the mistaken belief that, 'I am the body and the body is mine’,
so too, by cultivating the right belief that, 'l’ am not the body
and the body is not mine’, a seeker becomes liberated; because,

* In fact, no worldly illustration is completely befitting, pertaining to the
matter of knowing or believing in God. The reason, is that in believing or
knowing, the world, there is the association of mind and intellect, but in believing
and knowing there is no association of mind and intellect at all, meaning
thereby that God's experience is the realization by one's own self, not by mind-
intellect. Secondly, the act of believing and knowing the world has a beginning
and an end, but there is no such beginning and end, in believing and knowing
God. Reason being that there is nc relation of our being with the world atall, whereas
our relation with God is, since the very beginning, and will always be so.
"
27,"XX SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA —
as a principle, by not relying on, the accepted belief it tends to
| melt away. God, has clearly told us in the Gita, that an ignorant
person, accepting his link with the body, regards himself, as the
doer of things that happen— 'Ahankaravimudhatma kartahamiti
manyate’ (3.27). But an enlightened person, does not regard
himself as the doer, of. those activities—'Naiva: kificit karomiti
yukto manyeta tattvavit' (5.8). It means therefore, that to root
out a false belief, it is necessary to stress a true belief.

‘IT am a Hindi’, 'I am a Brahmana’, ‘I am a Sadhu’, etc., such
beliefs, become so firm that until man does not give these up by
himself, no one else, can make him change his belief. Similarly,
the belief that, 'I, am the body’, ‘I, am the doer’ etc., also becomes
so firm, that it is difficult for a seeker to give these up. But,
these worldly beliefs being unreal and untrue, are not everlasting
and are instead, changeable. As against these beliefs, such as,
‘I am not the body’, 'I am God's’ etc., being real and true are
never lost, but there is only a degree of forgetfulness, a turning
of back on these. Therefore, a real belief on becoming firmly
rooted, does not remain as mere belief, but is transmuted into
a realized awareness (experience).

Though, ‘Discipline aided by inner faculty has been described
in the Gita (as in, 4.24—30; 6.10—28; 8.8—16; 15.11 etc.) yet
‘Discipline unaided by inner faculty’ alone, has been described
with great emphasis (as in, 2.48,55; 3.17; 4.38; 5.12 (first half);
6.5; 9.30-31; 12.12; 18.62, 66,73 etc.). The reason is, firstly that
God desires that seekers should realize Him, early and easily. In
the second place, Arjuna has sought from Him, the means of his
own salvation, on being confronted with a situation of war. Thus,
the “Discipline unaided by the faculty’ alone, could be of use,
for his salvation; because by this discipline of 'Karana Nirapeksa
Sail’, man can achieve his salvation, under all circumstances
"
28,"SADHAKA-SANJIVANI XXI
even while carrying out his activities, according to scriptural
injunctions of karma. Only, through this discipline (without any
practice) Arjuna's delusion was ended and memory of his real
self revived (18.73). :

The ‘Discipline unaided by the inner faculty’, is useful for all,
in equal measure; because there is no necessity, for any special —
ability, condition etc. In this discipline, by developing an intense
desire for God-realization, and immediate separation from matter
being accomplished, the eternal God, is realized. Just as many
year's darkness might be, eliminated by merely kindling a candle,
so also, a very old relationship with matter (of countless births)

there might be, is cut off by a strong and keen yearning, for —
God-realization. Therefore, this intense yearning is a much higher
State, than even ‘Samadhi'—a state of meditative poise—born of
Karana Sapeksata. There is even, a deviation from the highest —
state of ‘nirvikalpa samadhi—into routine behaviour, as with a
beginning and an end, of ‘Samadhi’ also. So long as there is,
a beginning and an end, there exists an affinity for matter. On
renunciating the tie with matter, then seeking spiritual discipline
with the beginning and no end instead, there arises the realization
of an eternal union with God.*

In reality, there was never a disunion (viyoga) with God,
and this is not, even possible. Separation from God appears only
by an assumed relationship with the world (sarnyoga). A man —
intensely eager for God-realization, realises God immediately, after
renouncing the assumed link with the world and merges with Him. _

* Till there exists a tie with inertness, two states do obtain; because
changeable as it is, the inert Nature never remains uniform. Thus these two
States of entry into and exit from equipoise—'Samadhi' and ‘Vyutthana—
arise out of their tie with inertness. On severance of a tie with inertness,
what remains is ‘Sahajavastha’, eternal stateless state, which is called ‘Sahaja
Samadhr by the saints. There is then no relapse or return from it. :
"
29,"XXII SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA
_ Even the need to purify the inner faculty arises, only inthe

‘Karana Sapeksa Saili’, and not in the 'Karana Nirapeksa Sailr.
As, when a pen is good, writing can be excellent but that does
not improve the writer, so also on the inner faculty being pure,
activities could be pure but not the mind of the doer. The doer
becomes pure, on a breach of the tie with the inner faculty;
because the very belief in one's kinship with this, is the root

of impurity.

Axiomatic is '‘Jiva's (the being's), eternal union (yoga) with
the ever-available (nitya prapta) God; thus there is no need for
any instrument for His realization. Only the sight needs to be
turned towards that side, as is observed in Soi Ramacaritamanasa,
‘Sankara Sahaja Saraipu Sarnhara' (1.58.4) meaning, Lord Sankara
contemplated on the nature of His own self, turned his looks
into Himself. A thing looked at, is perceived by us, only by
turning the gaze to it and it becomes known, to be there. In the
same way, by simply discerning it, Nitya Yoga, is experienced.
But, on account of desire, expectation and enjoyment of worldly
pleasures, a great difficulty is felt in turning our sight or attention
towards it, and in realizing it. Till the mind remains tied to
the acquisition and enjoyment of worldly objects, there is no
Capacity in man to turn his gaze towards his real Self. If, by
any reason, chance or perception the gaze happens to be directed
toward the self, it would be extremely difficult to hold it there
permanently. The reason is, that intense endearment (priyata),
for destructible materials, which resides in the heart, does not
permit the understanding of one's eternal and obvious relationship
with God; and even if it is well comprehended, it does not allow
its stability. If intense longing prevails the Reality (tattva) is
realized, then this longing has the power to destroy the very

- attachment, for the world. |
"
30,"SADHAKA-SANJIVANI XXIT

_ All the three yogas—Karmayoga, Jnanayoga and Bhaktlyoga—
spoken of in the Gita are realizable through the discipline of
‘Sadhana 'Karana Nirapeksa’ 1.e., through one’s own self. As the
activity and material, are neither ours nor for ourselves, instead
these belong to others and are meant for the service of others.
The belief or thought thus discriminately arrived at, that 'I am not
the body, nor is the body mine, I am God's and God is mine’, is
not born of the ‘discipline aided by antahkarana and body etc.,
(practice), because it involves a breach of the tie with matter.
Thus, in Karmayoga the seeker himself, gives up his relationship
with inertness, in Jianayoga the seeker realizes his own self; and
in Bhaktiyoga, the seeker surrenders himself to God.

In this 'Sadhaka Sanjivanit commentary on the Gita too,

_ primary importance is given to the ‘discipline unaided by inner
faculty’; because this commentary has been written, keeping in view
the way a seeker's salvation 1s attained, easily and without delay.

-

Since my early age, I had a special interest in the Gita.
Meditative introspection on the Gita and association with and
utterances of saints and great souls, have been of immense help
to me in understanding the real import, of the Gita. The Gita,
brims with ideas, infinite and astounding, which provide great
satisfaction. The ability to understand these ideas fully, and
express these with perfection, is not within my power. But when
certain Gita-loving gentle persons pressed me hard and especially —
urged me, then I felt like preparing a commentary on the Gita,
with the object, that its hidden heart-touching ideas—marmika
bhava—may be revealed to me, so that others also, may in turn |
introspect and meditate upon these, and these ideas may become |
intelligible, to them too. :
"
31,"XXIV SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA
First, a commentary on the twelfth chapter was written which
was published in Vikrama Samvat 2030, under the name of, ‘Gita
Ka Bhaktiyoga’. A few years latter, a commentary on the thirteenth
and fourteenth chapters was dictated, which was published in
Vikrama Sarhvat 2035 as, ‘Gita Ka Jianayoga’. A thought
arose thereafter, that since there are three ""Yogas'—Karmayoga,
Jiianayoga and Bhaktiyoga—it would be more appropriate if three
books were prepared on the three yogas. With this in view, a
commentary on the twelfth chapter, was recast, enlarged and
combined with the commentary of the fifteenth chapter, which
was published in Vikrama Sarnvat 2039, as ‘Gita Ka Bhaktiyoga’,
| (second edition). Then, a commentary on the third, fourth and
fifth chapters, was dictated, which was published in two volumes,
under the title, 'Gita Ka Karmayoga’'. Its delayed publication
came in Vikrama Sarhvat 2040. .

_A different kind of format (Saili), was followed in the
afore-mentioned three books—'Gita Ka Bhaktiyoga’, 'Gita Ka
Jnanayoga’, and ‘Gita Ka Karmayoga’'; the order adopted in
them was, first the context (sambandha), then the verse (Sloka),
then the emotional import (bhava), next the analysis of the
verse (anvaya); and last, the 'pada’-wise commentary. After the
publication of these three volumes, the format was again changed
in the following order; first, the context, then the verse and last,
the commentary. In making the change, the inspiration came from
others also. The idea behind this change was, that the reading
material should be reduced a little, and set out early, so that
the readers would not have to spend more time in reading, and
that the book was prepared speedily, to reach the readers, early.
With this frame-work, the commentary on the sixteenth and the
seventeenth chapters, was. got ready first. This was published
in Vikrama Samvat 2039, under the name of 'Gita Ki Sampatti
Aura Sraddha'. A commentary on the eighteenth chapter, was
"
32,"SADHAKA-SANJIVANI XXV
prepared thereafter, which was also published in 2039, under —
the title: ‘Gita Ka Sara.’ | : |

After the commentary: on the sixteenth, seventeenth and

eighteenth chapters was completed, someone suggested that it —

would be better, if the meaning of the 'Slokas' was also provided;

for if the reader first grasped the meaning of the 'sloka’, it would

be easier for him to follow the commentary. Thus in the second
edition of 'Giti Ki Sampatti Aura Sraddha' (Vikrama Sarnvat 2040)

the meaning of ‘slokas' was also added. With the addition of the
meaning of the verses, a change in the order of the commentary
on the ‘padas’, was also introduced.

Later, a commentary on the tenth and eleventh chapters was
prepared and published, under the name of, 'Gita Ki Vibhiti
Aura Visvaripa-Darsgana’. Then followed a commentary on the
seventh, eighth and ninth chapters, which was published as 'Gita

Ki Raja-vidya’. Thereafter, came a commentary on the sixth
chapter, which was published as, ‘Gita Ka Dhyanayoga’. Last
was dictated a commentary, on the first and second chapters,
which was published as, ‘Gita Ka Arambha’. All these four books,
were published in Vikrama Sarnvat 2041.

It was thus that by the grace of God, a commentary on

_ the whole of the Gita was published by the Gita Press, in ten
separate volumes. In its publication, several difficulties, of paper
etc., continued to arise, but with the effort of 'Satsangi' brothers, —
the work of publishing these went on satisfactorily. The public
also accepted these books with enthusiasm and pleasure, with the
result that several books, underwent two or three editions. :

The present commentary has not been dictated sitting at one
place, and the order of dictation has also not been systematic, _
from the first chapter to the eighteenth. Therefore, many variations
may appear from the pre and post (piirvapara) view, between the:
"
33,"XXVI SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA
first and the last chapter. But seekers. will feel no difficulty in it,
anywhere. At some places a difference in interpretation might also
appear, but in that of Karmayoga, Jnanayoga and Bhaktiyoga—all
the three are independently instrumental in God-realization, and _
there is no real difference. The primary feeling (bhava), while
dictating the commentary has been, as to ‘how early the seekers
could be benefitted’. For this reason, there has been a change
in its language, diction etc., in this commentary. :
In this, the interpretation of many Slokas, is contrary to other
commentaries. But the intention is not, in the least, to show that
other commentaries are wrong; instead, I have interpreted the
verses as seemed. non-controversial, apt; corresponding to the
: context, rational, viable, satisfying and dear to me. There has never
been my intention of anyone's refutation or confirmation. ..—
The meaning of Srimad Bhagavadgita, is very profound. By its
reading, its teaching, introspection, meditation, and contemplation,
unique, strange and ever new ideas and emotions continue to
arise, whereby the mind and intellect, being thrilled; become
contented. While dictating this commentary, whenever the mood —
to capture these emotions arose, a strange flood of thought used
to overwhelm me, as to how and which of the ideas should I
relate—and I used to find myself at bay, in this regard. Yet
with the help of my associates, and respectworthy friends and
at their behest and persuasion, I could dictate something. They
used to write down those ideas and, after a revision, these were
briefly published in the form of books. Thereafter, whenever there
arose occasions to scan through these books, several discrepancies
| seemed to have crept into them, and it appeared that all the ideas
had not been included and many had been left out. So revisions
and enlargements continued to be made in these, from time to
time. Therefore, our readers are requested, to accept and give
"
34,"SADHAKA-SANJIVANI XXVII
appropriate importance only to contents written later, instead of _
comments, made earlier.

The commentary, on the whole Gita, being in several separate
volumes, a difficulty was felt in their revision and publication and |
in obtaining all of these volumes together. Keeping this in view,
the commentary on the whole Gita has been published now, in one
single volume, in the form of the present book. Before doing this,
the whole commentary published earlier, has again been looked
into and necessary revisions, alterations and enlargements have
also been introduced. The commentary on the thirteenth and the
fourteenth chapters, has been revised. Care has also been taken
to maintain the uniformity of language and diction. Many things
which were deemed unnecessary, have been omitted, many new
matters have been inserted, and many others, have been shifted
from one place to an appropriate place elsewhere. Matters which
had been variously repeated, have also been omitted, as far as
possible, though not completely. Repetition deserving special
attention and considered useful for seekers, has not been omitted.
Several shortcomings are still possible in this work, for which
I seek the reader's pardon, with folded hands. Readers are also
requested to kindly intimate any mistakes they may come across.
This will facilitate rectification, in future editions. :

A compendium of research articles, of new and novel themes,
pertaining to the Gita has been prepared separately and published
under the title, ‘Gita Darpana’.

First Chapter
INTRODUCTION |

After the expiry of twelve years of exile and residing in an
unknown place for one year, the Pandavas demanded half of their
kingdom from Duryodhana, as was his promise but he refused to
give even as much land as could be covered by the point of a
needle, without waging war. The Pandavas sought permission from
their mother Kunti, and accepted.the challenge of a war. After this
decision, both the Kauravas and the Pandavas, began preparation for it.
Sage Veda Vyasa had great affection for Dhrtarastra, the blind
king of Hastinapura. Due to his affection, he said to Dhrtarastra,
“War and massacre of the Ksatriyas 1s inevitable. If you want to
see the scene of the battlefield, I can endow you with divine sight
so as to enable you to see scene of war, from the place you are
sitting.” Dhrtarastra said, “I have been blind all my life. Now I
don’t want to see the slaughter of my own kith and kin. But I
want to hear the details of the war.” Then sage Vyasa said,” I
endow Sanjaya with this divine sight by which he will know,
hear and see, not only the incidents of the battlefield but also
the ideas, in the minds of the warriors and will narrate these to
you.” Saying so, sage Vyasa endowed Safijaya with divine vision.
The battle started on the battlefield of Kuruksetra at the appointed
hour. Safijaya stayed in the battlefield, for ten days. When Bhisma
being badly wounded with arrows, fell off the chariot, Safijaya
conveyed the message to Dhrtarastra who at that time was in
Hastinapura. Hearing this news, Dhrtarastra was filled with great
sorrow and started to cry. Then he asked Sanjaya to narrate to him
all the details of the war. Upto the twenty-fourth chapter of the
Bhisma-Parva (section), Safjaya narrated the incidents of the war.* At
the beginning of the twenty-fifth chapter, Dhrtarastra asks Safiijaya—
* In the Mahabharata there are eighteen sections. In those sections there
are several sub-sections. In the Bhisma section there is this Bhagavadgita, a sub-
section which begins with the thirteenth chapter of the Bhisma section and ends

with the forty-second chapter.

Dhrtarastra said: .

O SajijayaT, assembled at the holy-field of Kuruksetra, eager
to fight, what did my sons and the sons of Pandu, do? 1

| Comment:—

‘Dharmaksetre kuruksetre’-—In Kuruksetra the gods
performed holy sacrifice. King Kuru also performed penance
there. Thus being saturated with a spiritual atmosphere, the
field of Kuruksetra has been called the field of righteousness
(Dharmaksetra).

Here by the word ‘Ksetra’ in “‘Dharmaksetra’ and “Kuruksetra’
Dhrtarastra means to say that this is the land of the Kurus. This
is not merely a battlefield, but a land of pilgrimage, in which
human beings by performing holy actions, can attain benediction
in this life. Therefore, by consulting noble persons, this land has
been chosen, for both mundane and ultra mundane benefits.

In this world generally, there are three root causes of
disputes viz., land, wealth and woman. Out of these three, the
kings primarily fight for land. Hence, there is the significance
of the name ‘Kuruksetra’ here. In the Kuru-family the sons of
Dhrtarastra, as well as, those of Pandu, are included. Therefore,
both of them have an equal claim over the land of Kuru. But

* Within the dialogue between VaiSampayana and Janamejaya there is the
dialogue between Dhrtarastra and Safijaya; and within the dialogue between
Dhrtarastra and Sajfijaya there is the dialogue between Si Krsna and Arjuna.

‘ss F Safijaya was born of Gavalgana. He possessed knowledge and
righteousness like sages. He was Dhrtarastra’s minister (Mahabharata Adi. 63/97).
"
46,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 3
the Kauravas refuse to give the Pandavas their share of land, so
war between them becomes inevitable.

Though the word “Kuruksetra’ is fair and justified, because
the land belongs to both the cousin groups, yet Indian culture,
is so unique that righteousness is given top priority in it.
Therefore, even an action such as war, is performed on the field
of righteousness—a land of pilgrimage, so that the warriors may
attain salvation. Therefore, the word ‘Dharmaksetra’, has been
used along with ‘Kuruksetra’ here.

There is one more point, which needs attention. In the first
verse of the first chapter of the Gita, the first word is ‘Dharma’,
and in the last verse of the eighteenth chapter the last word is
‘Mama’. Therefore, if ‘Dhar’ is taken from the first word and ‘Ma’
from the last word, the word becomes ‘Dharma’ (righteousness).
Therefore, the whole of the Gita, comes within nghteousness viz.,
by following the path of righteousness, the principles of the Gita
are followed, and by discharging one’s duty according to the
doctrines of the Gita, the path of righteousness, is followed.

From these words “‘dharmaksetre kuruksetre’ all of us should
know that all actions should be performed by following the path
of righteousness. Every action, should be performed, not with
a selfish motive, but for the welfare of all, and the scriptures
should be the authority in determining what ought to be done
and what ought not to be done (Gita 16/24).

‘Samaveti yuyutsavah’—Duryodhana did not accept the peace
negotiations despite repeated proposals from many kings. Nay,
when Lord Krsna came to intervene as a mediator, Duryodhana
bluntly refused to part with, even as much land as could be covered
by the point of a needle, without waging a war (Mahabharata,
Udyoga. 127/25). Thus, Pandavas had no alternative but to
fight. Thus the two groups assembled to fight for their rights.

Though the two groups assembled to fight, yet Duryodhana
had a keener desire for war, in order to usurp the kingdom by
fair means or foul, just means or unjust viz., by hook or crook.
"
47,"4 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 1
Thus his side was very keen to wage a war.

The Pandavas, had the virtue of righteousness on their side.
For the sake of justice, they were prepared to face any hardship.
Knowing the deadly consequences of a war, Yudhisthira did not
want to indulge in it. But, as by obeying their mother, the five
Pandavas had married Draupadi, Yudhisthira by obeying his

_ mother, became willing to fight.* Thus, Duryodhana, and the
members of his group were eager to fight for usurping the kingdom,
while the Pandavas, were compelled to fight for righteousness.

‘Mamakah pandavascaiva’—The Pandavas, regarded Dhrtarastra
(being the elder brother of their father) as their father, and obeyed
his order, whether it was just or unjust. Therefore, here the word
‘Mamakah’ includes both the Kauravas and the Pandavasf. But
the word ‘Pandava’, has been mentioned separately, because
Dhrtarastra was not fair and just to the Pandavas. He was not.
impartial, he had partiality for his sons. So the word ‘Mamakah’,
has been used for his sons, while ‘Pandava’ has been used for the

* Kunti, the mother of the five Pandavas was very forbearing. She had a

| unique personality. She did not desire worldly pleasures and kingdom. She asked
Lord Krsna to grant her the boon of adversity. But there were two things which
always pinched her. The first of them was that villains such as Duryodhana etc.,
wanted to make her beloved daughter-in-law naked in the assembly. This insulting,
hateful and inhuman behaviour pained her very much. |

Secondly when Lord Krsna on behalf of the Pandavas went to Hastinapura
with a proposal of conciliation, Duryodhana, Duh4sana, Karna and Sakuni etc.,

~ wanted to arrest Him. Hearing this incident, Kunti thought that those villains should
, be killed, otherwise their increasing sins would lead them to damnation. It was
because of these two factors that Kunti ordered her sons, the Pandavas to fight.

+ Though the term ‘Kaurava’ includes both Duryodhana etc., the sons
of Dhrtarastra as well as Yudhisthira etc., the sons of Pandu, yet in this verse
Dhrtarastra has used the term ‘Pandava’ for Yudhisthira etc. So the term “Kaurava’
stands for Duryodhana etc.

+ Dhrtarastra had a partial outlook because he thought that Duryodhana etc.,
were his sons while Yudhisthira etc., were Pandu’s sons. So he never checked
Duryodhana from committing evil deeds such as poisoning Bhima and throwing
him into the water, trying to burn the Pandavas alive in the house made of lac,
gambling with Yudhisthira by foul means, sending an army to the forest to destroy
"
48,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 5
sons of Pandu. Thus, his feelings find expression in his speech.
It was because of his partial attitude, that he had to suffer the
torture of the destruction of his family. Therefore, every human
being should learn a lesson, that he should not be partial to
members of his house, street, village, province, country and sect,
because partiality leads to conflict, rather than love and goodwill.

The term ‘Eva’ (also), with the term ‘Pandavah’ has
been used to point out the fact, that the Pandavas should not
have waged war because they were righteous to the core. But
they also came to the battlefield, to wage war. So what did
they do there?

{‘Mamakah’ and ‘Pandavah’*—Sanjaya will explain the .
word ‘mamakah’, from the second to the thirteenth verses to |
Dhrtarastra. Seeing the army of the Pandavas, his son Duryodhana
told Dronacarya, the names of the chief generals of the Pandava-
army, in order to cause hatred in his mind against the Pandavas.
After that, Duryodhana named the principal warriors of his army,
praised their skill in warfare. In order to please and cheer up
Duryodhana, Bhisma blew his conch loudly. Hearing the sound
of his conch, the conchs and trumpets etc., of the Kaurava-
army blared forth. Then, from the fourteenth to the nineteenth
verses, Safijaya explains the word ‘Pandavah’, as was asked
by Dhrtaradstra. He says, Krsna, a supporter of the Pandavas,
seated in a chariot, blew his conch. After him Arjuna, Bhima,
Yudhisthira, Nakula and Sahadeva etc., also blew their conchs.
The terrible sound of those conchs rent the hearts of the army
of Duryodhana. After that Safijaya, while talking about the
Pandavas, starts the dialogue between Sri Krsna and Arjuna,
from the twentieth verse. ]
the Pandavas and so on. The reason was that Dhrtarastra had the feeling that
somehow or the other if the Pandavas were killed, his sons would rule over the
whole empire. |

* Describing ‘Mamakah’ and ‘Pandavah’ separately Safijaya uses the words
‘Duryodhana’ (1/2) and ‘Pandavah’ (1/14).
"
49,"6 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 1

‘Kimakurvata’—‘Kim’ , has three meanings—doubt, reproach
(blame) and question. : 7

The incident of the war cannot be doubted, because after
ten days of fighting when Bhisma fell off the chariot, Safijaya
conveyed the message to Dhrtarastra, at Hastinapura.

There cannot be reproach (blame) also because Dhrtarastra
did not blame his sons and the Pandavas, for the war, when the
war was already going on. |

Therefore ‘Kim’ means a question here. Dhrtarastra questions _
Sanjaya to relate him all the incidents in details, and in sequence
so that he may understand them properly.

| Appendix—‘My sons’ (mamakah) and ‘Pandu’s sons’
(Pandavah)—this distinction caused attachment—aversion which
led to war and commotion (stir). The result of .Dhrtarastra’s
attachment-aversion was that all the hundred Kauravas were
killed while even a single Pandava was not killed.

As curd is churned, a stir is caused in it by which butter
is extracted, similarly the stir caused by the distinction between
‘my sons’ (mamakah) and ‘Pandu’s sons’ (pandavah) caused
yearning for benediction in Arjuna’s mind by which butter in
the form of the Gita came into light.

It means that the commotion produced in Dhrtarastra’s mind
caused war while the commotion produced in Arjuna’s mind
revealed the Gita.

Safijaya said; :

At that time, seeing the army of the Pandavas drawn up in
battle array, approaching Dronacarya, prince Duryodhana, spoke
the following words. 2
Comment:—

‘Tada’—‘“Tada’, means the time when both the armies
were arrayed and Dhrtarastra was very much anxious to hear
the account of the battlefield.

‘Tu’—Dhrtarastra put the question about his sons and the
sons of Pandu. So Safijaya uses the word ‘Tu’, to tell Dhrtarastra
first about his sons. |

‘Drstva* pandavanikam vyidham’—It means that the army
of the Pandavas was arrayed in good order viz., the warriors

| had no difference in their opinionT. Righteousness, and Lord
Krsna, were in their favour. Therefore, the Pandavas, though
fewer in number, had greater impact. Seeing their army arrayed,
Duryodhana was also influenced. So he, approaching Dronacarya,
spoke prudent and serious words.

‘Raja Duryodhanah’—Duryodhana was called ‘Raja’, the king,
because Dhrtarastra had the greatest attachment and affection for
Duryodhana. Moreover, Duryodhana was the prince. He looked
after the affairs of the empire, while Dhrtarastra was only the
nominal head. Duryodhana was the main cause of the warfare
also. It was because of all these factors, that he was called king
by Safjaya.

* In this chapter the term ‘Drstva’ has been used three times—seeing the
Pandava-army, Duryodhana approaches Dronacarya (1/2); seeing the Kaurava- -
army, Arjuna lifts his bow (1/20); seeing his kith and kin, Arjuna is filled with
extreme passion (1/28). In the first two cases the term ‘Drstva’ has been used for
seeing the army while the third time it has been used for seeing the kith and kin
which changes Arjuna’s feeling.

t There was a difference of opinions inthe Katirava-army because Duryodhana
and Duhsasana etc., wanted to wage the war. But Bhisma, Drona and Vikarna
did not want. And there is a rule that where there is difference in opinions, there
vigour subsides. :
"
51,"8 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 1

‘Acaryamupasangamya’—It seems, that there were three
reasons why Duryodhana approached Dronacarya:—

(i) He went for his selfish interest, so that he could arouse
ill-will in Dronacarya’s heart, against the Pandavas and Dronacarya
might be specially partial to his army. |

(11) It was proper on his part to go to Dronacarya, to express
his regard for him, because he was his preceptor. |

(iii) It is very significant, for the chief warrior not to leave his
position otherwise the whole order of the army is disturbed. So,
it was proper on the part of Duryodhana, to go to Dronacarya.

| Here a question may be raised that, Duryodhana should have
first of all approached Bhisma because Bhisma was the commander
supreme. Then, why did he approach Dronacarya? The answer
is, that Drona and Bhisma both loved the Pandavas, and the
Kauravas, but Drona had special kindness and love for Arjuna.
Moreover, Duryodhana had a pupil-preceptor relationship with
Drona, but he had no family relationship with him. Therefore,
it was proper on his part to go to Drona, to please him. In
practical life also it is seen that a man for his selfish interest,
tries to please a person who is not closely related to him, by
offering him regard. |

Duryodhana thought, that Bhisma was his grandfather. So
it was easy to please him, even if he was displeased, because
of his family relationship. So Bhisma, also loved him very
much. Bhisma, blew his conch loudly, to please and cheer up
Duryodhana (1/12).

‘Vacanamabravit’—Here, it was sufficient to use the word

' *Abravit’ (spoke), which also includes “Vacanam’ (words). So

: there was no need to use the word “Vacanam’. Even then,
the term “Vacanam’ has been used, which shows that Duryodhana

spoke prudent and meaningful words, in order to arouse ill-will

in Dronacarya’s heart, against the Pandavas and to win his
favour, so that he could fight whole-heartedly, on the Kauravas
"
52,"Verse 3] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 9

side and they would gain victory. Thus the term ‘“Vacanam’ was

used with a selfish motive. _ - |

words:— : - 7

Behold, O Master, this mighty army of the sons of Pandu,
arrayed for battle by your talented pupil Dhrstadyumna, the son
of Drupada. 3 . |
Comment: -

‘Acarya’—-By addressing Drona as ‘Acarya’, it seems that
Duryodhana means to say that he is the preceptor, who taught
the Kauravas and the Pandavas, the science of warfare. So he
should not be partial, to either of the groups. .

‘Tava Sisyena dhimata—By this phrase Duryodhana means,
that Drona is so simple hearted, that he has taught the science
of warfare to Dhrstadyumna, Drupada’s son, who is born to
kill him (Drona), and who is so clever, that he is determined to
vanquish and kill none other than, his own preceptor. |

‘Drupadaputrena’—It means that Drupada, with the motive
of getting your honour killed, got a holy sacrifice performed, by
the two Brahmanas (men of the priest-class) named, Yaja and
Upayaja, and thus Dhrstadyumna, was born. The same Dhrstadyumna
was standing before him, as commander of the rival army.

Though Duryodhana, could speak the word Dhrstadyumna
instead of ‘Drupadaputra’, the son of Drupada, yet he intentionally
used “‘Drupadaputrena’, to remind Dronacarya of the enmity that
Drupada, had with him. So he really meant that it was a good
"

opportunity, to take a revenge. | : -

‘Panduputranam, etam vyidham mahatim camiim paSya’—
Behold the mighty army of the Pandavas, arrayed for battle by
the son of Drupada. It means that Duryodhana wants to say, “O
master, the Pandavas, whom you love, have made the son of
Drupada, the general of their army so that he may kill you. Had
they loved you, they would never have appointed him as a general.”

Though the army of the Kauravas, was larger than that of
the Pandavas, the army of the Kauravas was eleven ‘Aksauhini*,
while that of the Pandavas was only seven ‘Aksauhini’, yet
the army of the Pandavas seemed to Duryodhana, larger than
what it actually was. The army of the Pandavas, seemed more
formidable to Duryodhana because:—

(i) It was arrayed in such a manner, that even a small army
seemed larger to Duryodhana. | _

(ii) All the warriors of the Pandavas army, were united and
of one mind. So it seemed greater in strength and enthusiasm.

Drawing Drona’s attention to the army of the Pandavas,
Duryodhana wants to say to Dronacarya, that he should not regard
the army of the rival group as ordinary (small). He should fight
with all his might. and it would not be difficult for him to defeat
the son of Drupada, because he was his pupil. _.

‘Etarn paSya’, means that the army of the Pandavas 1s arrayed
for the battle. So you should take a quick decision how to get
victory over them. 3

Abhimanyu, the son of Subhadra and the five sons of Draupadi,
are also there. All of them are great chariot-warriors. 4—6
Comment:— - .

‘Atra §ira mahesvasa bhimarjunasama yudhi’—Those who
possess large bows and shoot with bows and arrows, are called
‘Mahesvasa (the mighty archers). They are very valiant and
extraordinary warriors. In warfare, they are as strong as Bhima,
and in the use of weapons and missiles such as bows and arrows
etc., as good as Arjuna.

‘Yuyudhanah’—Yuyudhana (Satyaki), learnt the science of
warfare, from Arjuna. Thus he was obliged to him, that he did
not go to the side of Duryodhana, even though Lord Krsna had
given Duryodhana, his Narayani army. In order to arouse malice
in the mind of Dronacarya,. Duryodhana, first of all, mentions
"
55,"12 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter ]
the name of Yuyudhana, the disciple to Arjuna. He means to
say, “You have taught Arjuna archery and granted him the
boon that you would try that he would be a matchless archer,
in this world (Mahabharata, Adi. 131/27). Thus you have so
much love for him. But he is so ungrateful, that he is arrayed
in the army against you, while Arjuna’s disciple Yuyudhana is
arrayed. on his side.” : |

[Yuyudhana was not killed in the warfare but in a mutual
fight-among the Yadavas.}

‘Virata$ca’—Duryodhana says, “It was Virata, who was
responsible for insulting the warrior, Susarma. Again, it
was because of him, that you became unconscious with the
Sammohana (beguiling) weapon, and we had to flee from the
battlefield, leaving behind his cows. The same king Virata is
opposing you.”

Dronacarya had no enmity or malice against king Virata. But
Duryodhana thinks that if he names Drupada after Yuyudhana,
Dronacarya may think, that Duryodhana is instigating him to
fight against the Pandavas, and he is arousing feelings of enmity
with them. So Duryodhana names Virata before Drupada, so that
Dronacarya may not see through his trick, and may fight bravely.

[King Virata and his three sons, named Uttara, Sveta, Sankha
were killed, in the war of Mahabharata. ]

‘Drupadasca maharathah—Duryodhana says, “You reminded
Drupada of your old friendship but he insulted you in the assembly,
saying that he was a king and you a beggar, and thus there was
no question of any friendship between him and you, and beget a
son who would kill you. The same great chariot-warrior, named
Drupada is arrayed to fight against you.”

[King Drupada, was killed in the warfare by Dronacarya.]

‘Dhrstaketuh’—How foolish this Dhrstaketu is, that he is
fighting on the side of Sri Krsna, who killed his father Sisupala,

with a disc, in the assembly. :

[Dhrstaketu was killed by Dronacarya.]

‘Cekitanah’— The entire yadava-army is ready to fight on our
side, but that solitary yadava is fighting on the side of Pandavas.

{Cekitana was killed by Duryodhana.]

‘Kasirajasca viryavan’—This king of Kasi is very valiant, a
great chariot-warrior and is fighting on the side of the Pandavas,
so be careful, as you have a very formidable foe to deal with.

[The king of Kasi was killed, in the battle of Mahabharata. ]

‘Purujitkuntibhojasca°—Though both Puryjit and Kuntibhoja,

yet being partial, they are arrayed to fight against us.

Dronacarya. } : :

an eye on them. |

{[Yudhamanyu and Uttamauja, were slain in their sleep, by
A&svatthama. ] |

‘Saubhadrah’—He is Abhimanyu, the son to Krsna’s sister
named Subhadra. He is very brave. He learnt the art of piercing
an array of soldiers, standing in the form of a circle, while he
was in his mother’s womb. So beware of him. :

[Abhimanyu was killed by Duhsasana’s son, when he unjustly
hit him, with a mace on the head.]

‘Draupadeyasca’—Draupadi, gave birth to five sons named

Prativindhya, Sutasoma, Srutakarma, Satanika and Srutasena
respectively, from Yudhisthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and
Sahadeva. Watch her five sons, carefully. She openly insulted me
in the assembly. So avenge that insult, by killing her five sons.

[Asvatthama killed the five sons, while they were asleep at night. ]

‘Sarva eva maharathah’—All of them are great chariot-
wattiors. They are well-versed in the scripture and in the use
of arms (A great chariot-warrior is, one who can manage ten
thousand archers). There is a large number of such great chariot-
warriors, in the army of the Pandavas.

Link:—Duryodhana described valour, bravery and skill of
the army of the Pandavas, in warfare so that hatred might be
aroused in Dronacarya, against the Pandavas, and he might be

that Drona was at heart partial to the Pandavas. So he might

make a peace-treaty, with the Pandavas. As soon as, this thought

| came to his mind,he described the heroes of his side, who were
very well trained in warfare, in the next three verses.

Comment:— .

'Asmakam tu visista ye tannibodha dvijottama'—Duryodhana
says to Dronacarya, ""O best of the twice-born, you should know
that in our army also, there are great chariot-warriors, who are
"
58,"Verse 7} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI - 15
in no way less valiant and less trained in warfare, rather they
are more valiant and better trained.” -

In the third verse ‘Pasya’, and here ‘Nibodha' verbs, are used
because the army of the Pandavas is standing in front of them,
therefore Duryodhana uses the verb 'PaSya’ (behold). But the army
of Kauravas, is not in front of Dronacarya, it is on the side of
his back. So Duryodhana, uses the verb 'Nibodha' (Know).

‘Nayakaé mama sainyasya safijhartham tanbravimi te'—I
mention the names of the chief generals, marshals and great
chariot-warriors of my army, to draw your attention to them.

‘Saiijiiartham’ means, that there are innumerable generals,
who cannot be named easily. Therefore, I am just drawing your
attention, as you know all of them.

In this verse, Duryodhana probably wants to say, that his |
side is in no way weaker than that of the Pandavas, but is rather
stronger, yet according to political prudence however weak the
army of an enemy may be; it should not be regarded as weak.
Therefore, one should not have in the least, a feeling of neglect
and indifference, towards the enemy. So Duryodhana already
described the warriors of the other side, to make Drona careful
and now he is giving the names of the warriors of his army.

Secondly, after seeing the army of the Pandavas compact
and well disciplined, Duryodhana was overawed and also
somewhat afraid. The reason was, that in spite of being smaller
there were several righteous persons, and as also Lord Krsna
Himself, in that army. Righteous persons and God bear their
influence on all the creatures, including those having the most
sinful conduct, and even on animals, birds, trees and plants. The
reason is, that God and righteousness are eternal, while all the
temporal powers are transient. Therefore, Duryodhana is also
influenced by the army of the Pandavas. But because of the
material and temporal power, he wants to assure Dronacarya,
that their army is superior to that of the Pandavas. Therefore,
they can easily gain victory over the army, of the Pandavas.

Yourself, Bhisma, Karna and Krpa ever victorious in battle;

and ASvatthama, Vikarna and Saumadatti (Bhirisrava), the son

of Somadatta. 8 |

Comment:— |
'Bhavanbhismasca'—You and Bhisma both are unique. So if

you fight with your full vigour, neither the gods, genies, devils,

nor men can encounter you. Both of you are famous for your
valour throughout the world. Bhisma has been a celibate since
birth and he cannot be killed, without his own will. |
[In the Mahabharata, Dronacarya was killed by Dhrstadyumna,
while Bhisma died during summer solstice, of his own free will.]
'Karnasca'—Karna is very brave. I believe, that he by himself
can gain a victory over the army of the Pandavas. Even Arjuna,
is no match for. him. Such a valiant warrior is standing on our

‘side. 7
[Karna was killed by Arjuna, in the war of Mahabharata.]

-'Krpasca samitifijayah'—Krpa, is immortal.* He is our well-
wisher and can gain victory over the whole army of the Pandavas.

Though Duryodhana, after mentioning the names of Dronacarya

and Bhisma, should have named Krpacarya. Yet, Duryodhana

had more faith in Karna, than in Krpacarya. So Karna's name
was spontaneously uttered by him. But he wanted to please

Dronacarya and Bhisma by calling Krpacarya, as ever victorious

in battle, lest they should regard it as an insult to Krpacarya.
'‘ASvatthama'—He is also immortal. Being your son, he is
* Agvatthama, Bali, Vedavyasa, Hanuman, Vibhisana, Krpa (Krpacarya),

Parasurama and Markandeya—these eight are immortal. In the scripture it

is written.
"
60,"Verse 9] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 17
very valiant. He is well versed in the science of warfare as he
has learnt it, from you. : | oO '

'Vikarnasca saumadattistathaiva ca'—You should not think |
that only the Pandavas are righteous. On our side, my brother
Vikarna is also very righteous and brave. Similarly Bhurisrava,
the grandson of our great grandfather's brother, Bahlika and the
son of Somadatta, is also very righteous. He has also performed
several holy sacrifices, by offering great gifts. He is also a very
brave and great chariot-warrior.

[In the warfare, Vikarna was killed by Bhima, and Bhurisrava
was killed by Satyaki.]

Here, by mentioning these names Duryodhana means to say,
""O preceptor (Acarya), in our army, there are so many valiant

_ warriors, such as you, Bhisma, Karna, Krpacarya etc., while in
the army of the Pandavas, such valiant warriors are not seen. In
our army, two great warriors named Krpacarya and Aésvatthama
are immortal, while in the army of the Pandavas there is none.
Moreover, in our army there is no scarcity of righteous persons,
therefore, we need not be afraid of them. |

Comment:—

'Anye ca bahavah Stra madarthe tyaktajivitah'— Besides the
above-mentioned heroes, there are many great chariot-warriors, such
as Bahlika, Salya, Bhagadatta, Jayadratha etc., in our army, who
"

have come here to fight, by staking their lives for me. They may be
killed in the war, but they will not run away from the battlefield.
How should I express my hearty thankfulness, to them before you?

‘Nanasastrapraharanah sarve yuddhavisaradah'—All these
heroes are experts in the use of weapons, such as swords, maces,
tridents and missiles, such as arrows and javelins etc. They are
in everyway, experts in the science of warfare.’

Link:—When Duryodhana by his cleverness could not deceive
Dronacarya, who did not say anything, he had a second thought.
This thought is described by Sanjaya in the next verse.*

aparyaptam tadasmakam balan bhismabhiraksitam
paryaptam tvidametesam balam bhimabhiraksitam

Our army is inadequate and is easier to be conquered, as it is
protected by Bhisma (a well-wisher of both the armies). But their
army marshalled by Bhima, is unconquerable (because Bhima
guards it well). 10 |
Comment:—

'Apary4ptam tadasmakam balam  bhismabhiraksitam'—
Duryodhana thinks about his army because of unrighteousness
and injustice, Duryodhana is afraid that, ""Our army though larger
than that of the Pandavas, is easier to be conquered, because
our army is unwieldy, indisciplined, disunited and faint-hearted,
while the army of the Pandavas, is compact, disciplined, united
and fearless. The chief protector of our army is Bhisma, who
is friendly to both the armies. He, is a great devotee of Krsna
He, in his heart has great respect for Yudhisthira and love for

* Safijaya by means of the divine insight he was endowed with by Sage Vyasa,
was able to know even the minds of the warriors (Mahabharata, Bhisma. 2/11).

Arjuna. Therefore, though outwardly, he is on our side; yet at
heart, he is a well-wisher of the Pandavas. He is the field-marshal
of our army. Under these circumstances, how can our army gain
victory, over the Pandavas?  ieit«w™” a |

'Paryaptam tvidametesam balam bhimabhiraksitam'— But, this
army of the Pandavas can be victorious over our army, very
easily because all the warriors of their army are united, without
having any difference of opinions. The protector of their army,
is Bhima who 1s brave and who has always defeated me, since
childhood. He has taken a pledge to kill all the hundred brothers
including me, he is bent on destroying us. His body is as strong
and hard as an adamant. I poisoned him but it did not kill him.
Having such a protector as Bhima, the army of the Pandavas is
certainly capable of gaining victory over our army.

Here, a doubt may arise that Duryodhana named Bhisma, who
was their field-marshal in defence of their army, but he named
Bhima, who was not a field-marshal in defence of the army of
the Pandavas. The answer is, that at that ttme Duryodhana was
not thinking about the field-marshals, but about the strength
of the two armies. Duryodhana, was very much influenced by
Bhima's power, so he named Bhima, as the protector of the
army of the Pandavas. :

Arjuna, beholding the army of the Kauravas raises his
bow (Gita 1/20), while Duryodhana, seeing the army of the
Pandavas approaches Dronacarya and requests him to watch
the army of Pandavas, arrayed for battle. It proves that
Duryodhana's mind has been. by fear-struck.* Though afraid,

* When the conchs of the army of the Kauravas blared forth, their sound had
no effect on the army of the Pandavas. But when the conchs of the army of the
Pandavas blared forth, their sound rent the hearts of Duryodhana etc., (1/13,19).

It proves that by following the path of injustice and unrighteousness the
hearts of Duryodhana etc., had become weak and horror-struck.
"
63,"20 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 1
yet with his cleverness he wants to please Dronacarya, and
instigate him, against the Pandavas. The reason is, that in
Duryodhana's heart, there are unrighteousness, injustice and
sin, and it is a rule that an unrighteous, unjust and sinful
person cannot live, happily and peacefully. On the other
hand, in Arjuna's heart there are righteousness and justice.
So he does not play any trick and have any fear to serve
his self-interest. He is fearless, courageous and brave. That
is why, he orders Lord Krsna, ""O Krsna, place my chaniot,
between the two armies"" (1/21). It means that a person, who
depends on perishable riches and property, etc., and whose
heart is full of unrighteousness, injustice and ill-feeling, does
not possess real power. He is hollow from within, and 1s
never fearless. On the other hand one who depends on God
and follows righteousness, is never fearful. His power is real,
and he always remains free from cares and fears. Therefore,
strivers, who aspire for God-realization should perform their
duty by depending only on God, and for His sake, renounce
unrighteousness, and injustice etc. They should never follow the
path of unrighteousness, by attaching importance to material
prosperity and contact-born pleasures, because these two lead
men to damnation, rather than to peace.

Appendix—Arjuna, instead of accepting the Lord’s Narayani
army well-equipped with arms and ammunition, accepted unarmed
Lord Krsna* while Duryodhana in place of Lord Krsna accepted
His Narayani army. It means that Aruna had an eye on Lord
Krsna while Duryodhana had an eye on His stately power.
The heart of the person, who has an eye on God, is strong
because God’s strength is real. But the heart of the person who

*evamuktastu krsnena kuntiputro dhanajfijayah

ayudhyamanam sangrame varayamasa keSavam (Maha. Udyoga. 7/21)

**When Lord Krsna said so, Anjuna, Kunti’s son in the battlefield instead of
accepting the Lord’s one Aksauhini army, accepted unarmed Lord Krsna as his
helper who wouldn't fight in the war.”’
"

has an eye on worldly power is weak as the strength of the :
world is unreal. |
Link:—Now Duryodhana to please Bhisma instructs all the
great chariot-warriors of his army, and says:— |

bhiraksantu bhavantah sarva eva hi'—All of you (warriors),
stationed in your respective position on different fronts, should —
guard Bhisma on all sides. ,
By saying the above words, Duryodhana wants to please
Bhisma, so that he may be partial to his army. Secondly, he
gives instruction to the warriors of his army, to see that Sikhandi
should not face Bhisma. If Sikhandi comes in front of Bhisma,
the latter will not use his arms and weapons against him, because
he was a woman in the previous birth. In that birth also, first he
was a woman and later he changed into a man. So Bhisma,
by regarding him as a woman, has promised not to fight with
Sikhandi. Sikhandi, had taken birth by Lord Siva's boon, to kill
Bhisma. Therefore, if Bhisma is protected from Sikhandi, he
will kill all other warriors of the army of Pandavas, and their
victory is certain. Therefore, Duryodhana ° gives instruction to
all the great chariot-warriors of his army, to guard Bhisma.

affection for him, cheers him up. This is expressed by Satijaya,
: in the next verse. _

The grand old man of the Kaurava race, their glorious grand-
: uncle Bhisma, cheering Duryodhana roared loudly like a lion, and
| blew. his conch. 12
Comment:— : ,
""Tasya saiijanayanharsam'—Here, it should have been said,
that Bhisma blew his conch and.it cheered Duryodhana. But it
| is said that Bhisma, cheering up Duryodhana, blew his conch.
Sanjaya wants to state that the very action of blowing the conch, |
will certainly cheer up Duryodhana. To express this influence of
Bhisma, Sanjaya uses the adjective ‘Pratapavan' (glorious).
""Kuruvrddhah'—Though in the Kuru race Bahlika (the younger
brother of Bhisma's father Santanu), was older than Bhisma, yet
Bhisma, possessed better knowledge of righteousness and God,
than all other old members, in the race. So Safijaya, calls him
'Kuruvrddhah’, (the grand old man of the Kaurava race).
""Pratapavan'— Bhisma was well-known for his renunciation
of wealth and woman i.e., he did not accept any kingdom nor did
he marry. He was well-versed in military science and scriptures.
So the warrior class were very much influenced by him.
When Bhisma for his brother Vicitravirya kidnapped all
by himself, the daughters of the king of Kasi, from the place
where their suitors had assembled to marry them, the Ksatriya
suitors attacked him, but he alone defeated all of them. He was
so well-versed, in the science of weapons and warfare, that he
did not accept his defeat even against his preceptor Parasurama,
"
66,"Verse 12] -SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI _ 23
who had taught him the science of weapons etc. Thus he had
great influence over the Ksatriyas (warrior class), because of his
skill in military science. |
When Bhisma was lying on a bed of arrows Lord Krsna
said to Yudhisthira, ""If you want to put any question on
righteousness (Dharma), ask him now, because the sun of the |
knowledge of scriptures, is going to set, 1.e., Bhisma, a great
scholar of scriptures is going to die.""* Thus, we see that he had
great mastery over the scriptures and others were very much
influenced by this knowledge.
'Pitamahah'—This word seems to mean that Dronacarya did
not attach any importance to the tricks played by Duryodhana.
He understood that Duryodhana wanted to deceive him. So he
remained silent. But Bhisma is the grand-uncle of Duryodhana.
So he sees Duryodhana's child-like behaviour, in his tricks. Hence ,
Bhisma unlike Dronacarya, breaks his silence and blows his conch
to cheer up Duryodhana, and show his affection for him.
'‘Simnhanadam vinadyoccaih Sankham dadhmau'—When a lion
roars ferociously, even large wild animals like elephants etc., get
horror-struck. Similarly, by roaring ferociously, Bhisma blew
his conch to cheer up Duryodhana, and terrorise the warriors,
of the hostile army. : :
-  Appendix—Duryodhana’s relationship with Dronacarya
was that of pupil-teacher while with Bhisma he had the family
relationship. Where there is the pupil-teacher relationship, there
is no partiality but in family relationship because of the affection
for the family, partiality ensues. Therefore having heard the
tricky words uttered by Duryodhana, Dronacarya remained quiet
which discouraged Duryodhana. But because of family-affection,
having seen Duryodhana sad, Bhisma blew the conch in order
_ to encourage Duryodhana.

Then conchs, kettledrums, tabors, drums and cow-horns,
suddenly blared forth and the noise was tumultuous. 13
Comment:— Oo

'Tatah Sankhasca bheryasca panavanakagomukhah'—Bhisma
had not blown his conch to declare war, his purpose was to
cheer up Duryodhana, but the army of the Kauravas thought
that the war was declared. So hearing the sound of the conch,
all musical instruments such as conchs etc., of the Kaurava-army

| suddenly blared forth. —

Conchs are found in the sea. These are blown in adoration
of God, on auspicious occasions and for declaring a war. ‘Kettle-
drums’ (bheri), are drums with large hollow bowls of iron, with
tops made of skins of buffaloes and are beaten with a wooden stick.
They are kept in temples and forts, and are beaten, specially on
functions and auspicious occasions. ""Tabors’ (panava), are small
drums like a tambourine. These are made of iron or wood, with
tops covered by the skin of goats, and are beaten with hand ora
wooden stick. Their beating is regarded as auspicious, as adoration
to Lord Ganeéga. 'Anaka' (drum), is a musical instrument made
of clay, with the top covered by leather and beaten with a hand.
‘Gomukha' (cow-horn), is a musical wind instrument, consisting
of a long metal tube usually bent like a serpent, having a cow
shaped mouth and is blown with the mouth.

'Sahasaivabhyahanyanta’*—Kaurava-army was full of great

their musical instruments suddenly blared forth, all at once
without much effort. :

tatah Svetairhayairyukte mahati syandane sthitau

madhavah pandavascaiva divyau sankhau pradadhmatuh

Then, seated in a glorious chariot drawn by white horses, Sri
Krsna as well as Arjuna, blew their divine conchs. 14
Comment:— /

'Tatah §vetairhayairyukte'—The Gandharva (a celestial .
musician) named Citraratha gave Arjuna, one hundred divine
horses. It was ordained that they would always remain one
hundred in number even though many of them were killed, on
the battlefield. They could go to heaven or live on the earth.
Out of these, one hundred horses, four beautiful and well-trained
horses, were harnessed to Arjuna's chariot.

_ 'Mahati syandane sthitau'—The Fire-god (Agni) suffered
from indigestion because a lot of ‘ghee’ (clarified butter) was
offered in a holy sacrifice to him. Therefore, though the fire-god
wanted to cure his indigestion by consuming medicinal herbs of
"
69,"| 26 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 1
| the Khandava forest, but he was unable to do it because it was
: protected by other gods. Whenever he tried to burn it, ‘Indra’,
the king of the gods extinguished the fire with the rain. At last,
with Arjuna's help Agni cured his indigestion, by burning the
whole forest and being pleased with Arjuna, Agni gave him a
very large and glorious chariot. As many weapons and missiles
| as could be accommodated in nine bullock carts, were held in
- it. It was gilded and glorious. Its wheels were strong and huge.
It's flag, shone like lightning over about a ""Yojana (eight miles),
| in distance. In spite of being so long it was neither heavy, nor
| could, it stop or be entangled in trees etc., Hanuman (the monkey-
god, who acted as a spy in Rama's march against Ravana), was

the emblem on the flag.

'Sthitau'—'Sthitau' means, that the beautiful and glorious
chariot became. more so, because Lord Krsna Himself, and His
dear devotee Arjuna, were sitting in it. |

_ ""Madhavah pandavascaiva'—'Ma' is Laksmi, the goddess of
wealth and prosperity, and 'Dhava,' is the husband or owner.
Therefore, 'Madhava' means the Lord of Laksmi, Sd Krsna, the
incarnation of Lord Visnu. Here, Pandava, has been used for

| Arjuna, because he is the chief among the Pandavas—'Pandavanarn
| Dhanaiijayah; (Gita 10/37). [Lord Krsna says, ""Among the Pandavas,

I am Dhanaiijaya (Arjuna).]"" (He has been called chief among the
Pandavas, because he had no individuality, apart from Lord Krsna.)

Arjuna and Sti Krsna were the incarnations of ‘Nara’ and
‘Narayana’, respectively. In the beginning of every ‘Parva’ (section)
of Mahabharata, there is salutation to Nara (Arjuna) and Narayana
(Lord Krsna). Thus, from this point of view also, Lord Krsna
and Arjuna both, were chiefs. Sanjaya also says in the last verse
of the Gita, ""Wherever there is Sri Krsna, the Lord of Yoga,
and wherever is Arjuna, the wielder of the bow (Gandiva bow),
there are prosperity, victory, glory and righteousness; this is my
conviction"" (18/78).
"
70,"Verse 15] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 27

'‘Divyau Sankhau pradadhmatuh'—Lord Krsna and Arjuna,
loudly blew their conchs, which were glorious and divine.. _

Here, it. may be stated, that it was proper on the part of
Bhisma to blow his conch first, because he was the field-marshal
of the Kaurava-army. But how far was it justified on the part of
Lord Krsna, the chariot-driver of the Pandava-army, to blow the
conch, when the field-marshal, Dhrstadyumna of the Pandava-
army, was there? The answer, is that Lord Krsna is ever chief,
whether He works as a chariot-driver or a great chariot-warrior. He
is ever great, whatever the rank He may hold, because His rank
is 'Acyuta’ (fixed), He never deviates from his divine nature. In
Pandava-army, Lord Krsna was the chief and director. Even when,
he was a boy, Nanda and Upananda etc., obeyed him. Therefore,
they, by obeying him, started to worship Govardhana, (a mountain),
instead of Indra, the king of gods, who had been worshipped for
generations. It means, that the Lord, in whatever state, place and
circumstance, He may live, is ever the chief. Therefore, Lord
Krsna was the first in the Pandava-army, to blow his conch.

One, who is really inferior, regards himself as superior, after
getting an appointment to a high post. On the contrary, one who
is really superior is superior everywhere, and he elevates the
post, at which he works. Thus, Lord Krsna, while working as a
chariot-driver, elevated that post.

Link:—Sanjaya in the next four verses, in explaining the
previous verse and giving: some more details, describes the
blowing of conchs by ather warriors. :

-  HrsikeSa (Sri Krsna), blew his conch named PaAiicajanya,
Dhanafijaya (Arjuna), his conch called Devadatta; while Vrkodara
(Bhima), of terrific deeds, blew his mighty conch the Paundra. 15
Comment:— |

""Paiicajanyam hrsikesah'— Hrsikesa’, means the master of mind
and senses, Lord Krsna who pervades the mind and intellect
of all viz., who is acquainted with the hearts of all the people,
arranged on the side of the Pandavas, blew his conch named
Paficajanya. Lord Krsna having killed demon named Paijicajana
who appeared in the form of a conch, used him as a conch. So
His conch was named as 'Pajicajanya.”

'Devadattam dhanafijayah'—The word ‘Dhanafjaya means
conqueror of wealth. At the time of the holy sacrifice named
Rajasttya, Arjuna took over wealth of many rulers on gaining
victory, over them. So Arjuna was called 'Dhanajfijaya.* Indra, the

_ king of gods, gave Arjuna the conch named Devadatta, while he
was fighting with demons named Nivatakavaca etc. It produced
such a loud and horrifying sound that the army of the enemies
became terror-struck. This conch was blown by Arjuna. —

'Paundram dadhmau mahasankham bhimakarma vrkodarah'—
Bhima, was named 'Bhimakarma (doer of tremendous deeds)
because he killed demons, such as Hidimba, Baka and Jata etc.,
and valiant warriors, such as Kicaka and Jarasandha etc. In his

- belly, besides the heat which helps to digest food, there was a
special fire, named 'Vrka’ which digested a lot of food, very easily.
It was because of his great digestive power, that he was named
""Vrkodara.’ Thus, Bhima who was the doer of terrific deeds and
possessed strong digestive power, blew his mighty conch, Paundra.

sahadevasca sughosamanipuspakau'—Arjuna, Bhima and

Sahadeva were Madri's sons. So the adjective 'Kuntiputra’ (Kunti's

sons) has been used for Yudhisthira. |
Yudhisthira has been called a king because he was the ruler

of half of the Indraprastha kingdom before exile and according
to the promise and the law, he should have been a king after
living in exile for twelve years and one year's incognito residence.

Moreover, by calling him a king, Safijaya wanted to hint that he

would be the king of the entire territory afterwards.

prthak'—The great chariot-warrior Sikhandi, was very
brave. He in his previous birth was a woman, (the daughter
named Amba of the king of Kasi), and in this birth also, was
born as a daughter to king Drupada. Afterwards, she became
a man by getting manhood from a genie, named Sthunakarna.
Bhisma knew all this and therefore, he regarded him as a woman,
and did not shoot arrows at him. Arjuna while fighting kept
Sikhandi ahead, shot arrows at Bhisma and overthrew him from
the chariot.

Arjuna’s son Abhimanyu, was very brave. In warfare, he
killed many warriors, by entering the array of soldiers stationed,
in the form of a circle formed by Drona. At last, six great chariot-
warriors of the army of Kauravas, surrounding him by foul means,
attacked him with weapons and missiles. He was killed, when
Duhsasana's son, hit him on the head, with a mace.

Saiyaya, mentioned only one warrior named Bhisma, who
blew his conch from the Kaurava-army, while he mentioned
eighteen warnors, such as Lord Krsna, Arjuna, Bhima etc.,
from the Pandava-army. It seems that Safijaya, did not want to
describe the unrighteous side of the Kaurava-army, in detail.
But, he had great regard for Lord Krsna, the Pandavas and the
Pandava-army, because of their righteousness. So he thought it
proper, to describe the warriors of Pandava-army, in more detail
and he took delight in describing them.

of the conchs on the Kaurava-army.

sa ghoso dhartarastranam hrdayani vyadarayat

nabhasca prthivim caiva tumulo vyanunadayan

The terrible din, echoing through the sky and the earth, rent
the hearts of Dhrtarastra's sons, who had usurped the kingdom
by unjust means. 19
Comment:— |

‘Sa ghoso dhartarastranam hrdayani vyadarayat nabhaSca
prthivim caiva tumulo vyanunadayan’'—The sounds of the conchs
of the Pandava-army, was so thunderous, roaring and horrifying,
that it echoed through the sky and the earth, and rent the hearts
of the Kauravas, who had usurped the empire, and also of the
kings, who had come to fight on their side. It means, that, as
a weapon or a missile, rends the heart and causes it pain so
does, the sound of the these conchs. That sound discouraged
the Kaurava-army and its warriors were horror-struck, at the
formidable strength of the Pandava-army.

Sanjaya was relating the incidents to Dhrtarastra. So it seems
that it was not proper on his part to mention, 'Dhartarastranam’
(Dhrtarastra's sons). He should have mentioned ‘Tavakinanam’'
(his sons and relatives), which would have been polite. But he
used the word correctly, because it was justified on his part to
use it as he meant to say, that his sons usurped the kingdom.
Their hearts were rent, because they were unrighteous. Therefore
the use of the word is justified further.

_ Here a question may arise why there was no effect of the
sound of the war instruments, such as conchs etc., of the eleven
Aksauhini army (In an Aksauhini army there are 109350 foot
soldiers, 65610 horses, 21870 chariots and 21870 elephants) of
the Kauravas* on the Pandava-army, but the sound of the conchs

* It was impossible for Duryodhana to have such a large eleven Aksauhint
"
75,"32 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 1
of seven Aksauhini army of the Pandavas rent the hearts of the
Kaurava-army. The answer is that the hearts of those who are
righteous and just, are impregnable. Pandavas had ruled over
the empire with justice and righteousness, before their exile
and also demanded their empire from the Kauravas, which was
a just demand. On the other hand, the hearts of those who are
unrighteous, unjust and sinful, are weak, doubtful and full of
fear. It is their sin or injustice, which weakens their hearts.
Duryodhana and his group, tried their best to kill Pandavas, by
any means—fair or foul. They usurped their empire and caused
them much trouble. ‘Thus, they stood for unrighteousness. So the
sound of the conchs of seven Aksauhini army of the Pandavas,
rent their hearts, with a piercing pain.

This incident, warns a striver, that he should never have
unjust and unrighteous dealings, through his body, speech and
mind, because these weaken the heart and create fear, in it. For
example, the creatures of the world, including the gods and the
demons, were afraid of Ravana, the king of Lanka. But when
he abducted Sita, he being terrified, looked here and there, to
see if anyone was watching him (Manasa 3/28/4-5).

PII EES

Link:—In the first verse, Dhrtarastra put a question, about
his -sons and sons of Pandu. Sanjaya answered the question,
from the second to the nineteenth verse. Now Sanjaya starts
army. But when the Pandavas were exiled, Duryodhana adopted the policy of
Yudhisthira. As Yudhisthira ruled over the subjects with justice and righteousness
to give them comfort, thinking it his duty, Duryodhana also did the same to establish
his influence over them. It was because of his good behaviour towards the people
for thirteen years that the army which liked the Pandavas, came over to his side.
Thus he could win the confidence of nine Aksauhini army because of his good
behaviour. Lord Krsna gave him one Aksauhini army. Moreover he tricked one
Aksauhini army of king Salya of Madra to his side which had been on the side
of the Pandavas. Therefore on the side of the Kauravas there was an army eleven
Aksauhini in number while on the Pandava side it was seven Aksauhint1.

Pandava (Arjuna) whose ensign bears the Hanuman, lifting his
bow, spoke the following words, to Krsna. 20
Comment:— a : |

'‘Atha'—This word means, that now Sanjaya begins the
Bhagavadgita, in the form of a dialogue between Lord Krsna
and Arjuna. This dialogue, ends with the word 'Tti’ used in the
seventy-fourth verse of the eighteenth chapter. Similarly, the gospel
of the Gita begins, with the eleventh verse of the second chapter, -
and ends with sixty-sixth verse of the eighteenth chapter.

'Pravrtte Sastrasampate'—Though Bhisma had blown his conch
to cheer up Duryodhana, not to declare war, yet the Kaurava and
Pandava armies thought that the war had been declared, and so
they became ready with weapons and missiles in their hands.
Seeing them equipped with weapons and missiles, Arjuna also
lifted his bow, named Gandiva.

'Vyavasthitan dhartarastran drstva'—-By these words Safijaya
means, ""When your son Duryodhana saw the army of Pandavas, he
fled to Dronacarya. But when Arjuna saw the army of Kauravas,
he lifted his bow."" 'Dhanurudyamya’ (took his bow)—it shows,
that Duryodhana was filled with fear, while Arjuna was fearless,
courageous and valiant. | |
"
77,"34 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 1
‘Kapidhvajah'—By using this epithet 'Kapidhvajah', Sanjaya
wants to remind Dhrtarastra of Hanuman, sitting on the banner
of Arjuna’s chariot. When Pandavas used to live in the forest,
one day suddenly, the wind dropped a divine lotus having a
thousand leaves before Draupadi. She was very much pleased
to see it, and she said to Bhima, ""O excellent among the brave,
bring me several lotuses of this kind.” Bhima, started to satisfy
her desire. When he reached the Kadali forest, he happened to
meet Hanuman. Both of them talked about many things. At last
Hanuman desired to grant him a boon. Bhima said, ""May your
kindness continue to be with me!"" Hanuman said, ""O son of wind-
god, when uneasy by being injured with arrows and weapons,
enter the army of the enemy and make a roar, I'll enhance that
roar by adding my own power to it. Moreover, by sitting on the
banner of Arjuna's chariot I'll make such a roar, that it will be
deadly terrifying to your enemy, and you will gain a victory,
over them and kill them very easily.’’* Therefore, the victory of
those, on whose banner Hanuman was sitting, was _ certain.

‘Pandavah'—Dhrtarastra, used the word ‘Pandavah' in his
question. Therefore, Safijaya also used the word 'Pandavah’, several
times (as in 1/14 and here in 1/20) to remind Dhrtarastra of
the Pandavas.

""HrsikeSamm tadaé vakyamidamaha mahipate'—Duryodhana,
seeing the army of Pandavas, approaching his preceptor Drona,
spoke the words cleverly; while Arjuna seeing the army of
Kauravas approaching Lord Krsna, who is a world-teacher, who
is acquainted with the hearts of all, and who is the inspirer of
mind and intellect etc., spoke the words full of bravery, courage,
and duty. :

senayorubhayormadhye ratham sthapaya me'cyuta

yavadetannirikse'ham yoddhukamanavasthitan

kairmaya saha yoddhavyamasminranasamudyame

Arjuna said: |

O Acyuta, (Acyuta means one who does not deviate from his
divine glory) place my chariot between the two armies and hold
it there, till I have carefully observed the war-minded warriors,
with whom, I must wage this war. 21-22
Comment:— |

'‘Acyuta senayorubhayormadhye ratharm sthapaya'—The two
armies were stationed at such a distance, from each other from
where they could shoot arrows etc., at each other. Arjuna asked
Lord Krsna to place the chariot in the middle. It was middle in
two ways (i) The middle of the breadth of the armies. (ii) The
middle of the two armies viz., equidistant from the two armies
should be the same. His purpose was to see the two armies, easily.

‘Senayorubhayormadhye’ has been used in the Gita three
times—here (in 1/21), in the twenty-fourth verse of this chapter
and in the tenth verse of the second chapter. He uses this phrase
three times, because the first time he asks Krsna to place the
chariot between the two armies (1/21), then Lord Krsna placing
the chariot between the two armies, tells Arjuna to behold the
Kauravas (1/24) and afterwards, preaches the gospel to despondent
Arjuna, right there (2/10). To begin with, Arjuna was valiant,
but when he saw his kith and kin in battle array, he developed
an attitude of disinterest being overtaken by attachment. Finally,
"
79,"36 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 1
Lord Krsna preached the gospel of the Gita, which dispelled his
attachment. It means, that a man in whatever circumstances he
is, by making proper use of circumstances, can be free from
desires and can realize God, because God (Paramatma), always
remains uniform in all circumstances.

""Yavadetannirikse'ham......ranasamudyame'—How long should
the chariot be placed between the two armies? Arjuna says, ""Hold
the chariot there, till I have carefully observed those war-minded

| kings with their armies, who are stationed in the army of Kauravas

| and with whom [ have to wage war. Let me see the heroes, I

| have to encounter. Let me, also see which of them are inferior,
superior and equal to:me, in heroism.""

Here, by the phrase ""Yoddhukaman,’ Arjuna means to say,
that they sent a proposal of conciliation, but the Kauravas did
not accept it, as they had a keen desire to wage war. So, he
wants to observe the warriors and their bravery, which makes
them so confident to wage war. :

and tried his best to humiliate them. Arjuna says, ""We are the

is evil-minded and these kings have assembled here to try to do
good to him. But the duty of a friend, is to give him such advice
as may add to his welfare now and hereafter. But, these kings
instead of removing his evil-mindedness, want to enhance it and
are really degrading him, by instigating him to wage war. They
are not thinking of his welfare here and hereafter. As friends, -
they should have advised him to rule over, half of the kingdom
and handover the other half, to us, the Pandavas. Thus, he would
have ruled: over half of the empire, and his life in the next world
would also have been protected."" |
""Yotsyamananavekse'ham ya ete'tra samagatah'— I want to
observe the warriors, who are so impatient to wage war. They
have favoured unrighteousness and injustice; so they are sure to
be ruined in the war, against us.
""Yotsyamanan'—it means that Arjuna wants to see those,
who have a keen desire to fight.

81,"38 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 1
Safijaya said: | . ,
""OQ Bharata"" (born in Bharata-family), thus addressed by
GudakeSa (one who has control over sleep viz., Arjuna), HrsikeSa
: (the Lord of the senses) placed the magnificent chariot between
the two armies, in front of Bhisma, Drona and all the kings, and
said, ""O Partha (the son of Prtha, Kunti), behold all these Kurus,
assembled here."" 24-25
Comment:— :
'GudakeSena'—'GudakeSa' has two meanings (1) ‘'Guda' means
‘curled’ and 'KeSsa' means ‘hair.’ It means one having curly hair
(ii) 'Gudaka' means 'sleep' and ‘Isa’ means ‘master.’ It means,
one who has conquered sleep. Arjuna had curly hair and he had
conquered sleep. So he has been called 'Gudakeéa’.
'Evamuktah'—One, who is not a slave to sleep, idleness and
worldly pleasures, but is a slave (devotee) to God; God listens
to such a person and even obeys him. Having said so, in order
to carry out the wish of his devotee-friend Arjuna, Lord Krsna,
placed the chariot between the two armies.
'Hrsikesah'—'Hrsika’ means 'senses' and 'Iéa' means ‘Lord.’
Thus 'Hrsikesa means the Lord of the senses. In the twenty-first
verse and also in this verse, this word has been used because
Lord Krsna, who is the inspirer of minds, intellects and senses
and who commands the whole world, has become a chariot-driver
to carry out Arjuna’s wish. It shows how kind He is to Arjuna.
'‘Senayorubhayormadhye sthapayitva rathottamam'—Lord
Krsna stationed Arjuna's noble chariot in the open space, between
the two armies.
'‘Bhismadronapramukhatah sarvesam ca mahiksitam'— Lord
Krsna placed the chariot with His sagacity, at such a point from
where his kinsmen such as. Bhisma, his preceptor Drona and
chief kings and warriors of Kaurava-army, could be clearly seen.
'Uvaca partha pasyaitan samavetankuriniti'—In the word
‘Kuru’, the sons of both Dhrtarastra and Pandu are included,
"
82,"Verse 24-25] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 39
because both of them belong to the Kuru family. Lord Krsna,
by saying ‘Behold all these Kurus assembled here’ means, that
by seeing them, Arjuna may think that they are all one, whether
they are on his side or on the opposite side and whether they
are good or bad and thus a feeling of kinship may develop in
him. This feeling of kinship may lead to attachment and make
him inquisitive. Thus, by making Arjuna an instrument, Lord
Krsna wants to preach the gospel of the Gita for the benediction
of the creatures of Kali-age. Therefore, Lord Krsna, instead of
using ‘Dhartarastran’, used the words 'Kurun'. If he had used
‘Dhartarastran’, Arjuna would have become enthusiastic and
. Lord Krsna, could not have got a chance to preach the gospel
of the Gita and Arjuna’s delusion, born of kinship, could not
have been destroyed. But, Lord Krsna, thought it His duty to
destroy Arjuna's delusion. As a surgeon, first gives medicine, to
a patient suffering from a boil so that it may suppurate and then
performs an operation, to remove the diseased part, in the same
way, God first arouses the hidden delusion of Arjuna and then
destroys it. Here, Lord Krsna by using the phrase ‘kurun pasya’
first arouses delusion in order to destroy it, by advice later.
Arjuna in the twenty-second and twenty-third verses of this
chapter wanted to behold and observe them. So Lord Krsna says,
“Behold these Kurus."" Lord Krsna could have placed the chariot
without uttering any words but he intentionally used the phrase
‘Kurtin pasya' to arouse attachment in Arjuna. |
There is a vast difference, between love for the family and
love for God though there is also a little similarity. When we
have love for members of our family, we overlook their faults,
because we have a feeling of mineness with them. Similarly,
God also does not heed the shortcomings of His devotee, because
He has the feeling that he is His own. But, in domestic love,
importance is attached to matters such as body etc., while in
love for God, there is importance of feelings. In family love,
"
83,"40 ~ SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter |
there is importance of delusion, while in love for God, there is
importance of alliance. In family-love, there is darkness, while
in divine love, there is light. In family-love, a man is negligent
of his duty, while in love for God, being engrossed in love, a
man may forget his duty momentarily, but is never negligent
of his duty. In family-love, there is pre-eminence of the family,
while in love for God, there is pre-eminence of God.

there and standing at their appointed places was filled with extreme
compassion and uttered these following words, in sadness. 27
Comment:— |

""Tan sarvanbandhiinavasthitan samiksya'—Besides the warriors
mentioned in the previous verse, Arjuna saw great grandfathers,
such as Bahlika etc., brothers-in-law, such as Dhrstadyumna,
Sikhandi and Suratha etc., sister's husbands, such as Jayadratha
etc., and several other relatives, who were posted in different
positions in both armies.

‘Sa kaunteyah krpaya parayavistah'—'Sa kaunteyah' means,
that Arjuna, who was ordered by mother Kunti to wage war and
who full of valour and  stout-heartedness, entered the battle-
field to observe the chief warriors of the Kaurava-army, was
overcome by cowardice.

After seeing the warriors, who were related to him, through
family and learning, on both the sides, Arjuna suddenly developed |
an attitude of kinship with them because he thought that on both
sides there were his kinsmen and they would be killed in the war.
In this way it was his family that would be destroyed ‘on either
"
85,"42 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 1

: side. Thinking thus his stout-heartedness gave place to cowardice
and he gave up the idea of war. This faint-heartedness, has been
called by Lord Krsna (in 2/2-3) 'KaSmalam’ viz., dejection and
‘Hrdayadaurbalyam’ viz., weakness of the heart. Arjuna (in 2/7)
also accepted it as ‘'Karpanyadosopahatasvabhavah' viz., nature
being tainted by the weakness of faint-heartedness. 'Krpayavistah'
means, that faint-heartedness is a temporary phase in him, while
stout-heartedness 1s a permanent virtue, of his life. Thus the
temporary phase of faint-heartedness cannot last too long, while
his stout-heartedness will remain, forever.

What is extreme cowardice? Extreme cowardice in Arjuna
is, that he does not think and make effort to kill his cruel and
unrighteous opponents, such as Duryodhana, Duhsasana and
Sakuni etc., who, without any reason, insulted the Pandavas gave
them trouble and tried to kill them, somehow or the other. On
the other hand, he is taking pity on them (Gita 1/35,46) and is
thus deviating from his duty, of the warrior-class.

'Visidannidamabravit'—Arjuna, is very much dejected after
thinking over the consequences of a war for the family, tribe
and country, and speaks the following words.

body shivers and hair stand on end. The bow, Gandiva slips from

* my hand, my skin burns all over. My mind is reeling as it were

and I am not able even, to stand. 28—30

Comment:—

'Drstvemam svajanarn krsna yuyutsurh samupasthitam'—
Arjuna loved the name Krsna, very much. So he has been
addressed by this name in the Gita nine time, more than any
other name. Lord Krsna, similarly loved Arjuna's name ‘Partha’
(the son of Prtha, Kunti). Therefore, while talking together,
both of them addressed each other by these names and this fact
was well-known to other people also. Therefore, Safijaya at the
end of the Gita in 18/78 mentions ‘Krsna’, and 'Partha—'Yatra
yogesvarah krsno yatra partho dhanurdharah (viz., wherever is
Krsna, the Lord of Yoga and wherever is Partha (Arjuna), the
wielder of the bow).

Dhrtarastra, in the first verse of this chapter, uses the phrase
‘Samaveta Yuyutsavah' (gathered together desirous to fight) and
Arjuna here has said, ""Yuyutsurn Samupasthitam’ (arrayed eager
to fight). But there is a vast difference, in the views of the two.
Dhrtarastra is partial to his sons. So, he uses the words 'Mamakah'
(Mine), and 'Pandavah' (Pandu's). But Arjuna is impartial. So he
uses the term 'Svajanam' (Kinsmen), which includes, persons of
both sides. It means, that Dhrtarastra is worried about the death.
of his’ sons in the warfare, while Arjuna is worried about the
death of warriors, in both armies, because he thinks that both
the warring groups, are his own kith and kin.

Till now the word 'Drstva' (having seen), has been used three
"
87,"44 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 1
times—'Drstva tu pandavanikam' (Having seen the army of the
Pandavas) (1/2), 'Vyavasthitan drstva dhartarastran' (Having seen
Dhrtarastra's party arrayed) (1/20), and here 'Drstvemarh svajanam’
(Having seen these kinsmen). It means, that there is no change
in the attitude of Duryodhana, as far as war is concerned. But,

7 there is a lot of change in Arjuna’s attitude. First, after seeing
the sons of Dhrtarastra, Arjuna like a hero, gets ready for war.
But after seeing his relatives present there, he is overwhelmed
with extreme compassion, his bow slips from his hand, and he
is not inclined to fight.

'Sidanti mama gatr4ni........bhramativa ca me manah'—Thinking
of the consequences of the war, Arjuna is worried and sad. So
his limbs are giving way, his mouth is getting parched, his body
shakes, and his hair is standing on an end. The same Gandiva
bow, the sound of whose string, terrified enemies, is dropping
from his hand and his skin is burning all over.* His mind tis
reeling, he is in a dilemma, and he is unable even to stand at
the war-front. He feels, as if he will fall unconscious, and thinks
it is a sin to wage war.

* Worry had been compared with pyre. There is a little difference between
the two. Worry burns a living man while pyre burns a dead man.
"
88,"Verse 32] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 45
Comment:—

'Nimittani ca pasyami viparitani keSava'—O KeSava, I find the
omens* inauspicious. Enthusiasm in the beginning of an activity,
leads it to success, while dilemma leads, to failure. So Arjuna
says that the omens—that his limbs are giving way, his body
is shaking, his mouth is getting parched—are not auspicious.T
Besides, these, other omens, such as the falling of a meteor,
untimely eclipse, earthquake, horrible sound of birds and animals,
obliteration of a black mark in the moon, falling of blood from
clouds, are inauspicious and all of these augur ill.

""Na ca Sreyo'nupasyami hatva svajanamahave'—I do not see
any good, in killing my kith and kin either in this world or
in the next, because only a sinner can destroy his kith and kin.
Therefore, sin, alone will accrue to us by killing them, and that
sin will lead us to hell.

In this verse, in both 'Nimittani paSyami' (I see omens) and
‘Sreyah anupasyami' (I see good) Arjuna wants to say that,
whether he goes by the omens or by this common sense, it 1s
certain that it 1s futile to wage war, and there is no good in it,
for them and for the entire world.

Comment:— | | |

[Lord Krsna in the twenty-first verse of the sixteenth chapter,
says that passion, anger and greed, these constitute the triple gates
to hell. Really these three, are different forms of passion. These
are born out of our attachment for worldly things and person.
Passion has two sides—to get the desired thing, and to get rid of
undesired one. Desired things include accumulation and enjoyment.
The desire for, accumulation is known as ‘greed’ and, desire for
enjoyments, is called 'passion.' If desire for accumulation and
enjoyment is not satisfied, anger accrues. In anger, men perform
actions, to destroy those who create obstacles, in the fulfilment
of their desires. It proves, that men fight to get desired things
and to get rid of undesired ones. But Arjuna, does not: want to
fight for either of the two.] : .

'‘Acaryah pitarah....kim nu mahikrte'—If our kith and kin,
being prompted by greed or anger want to slay me, I do not
seek to kill them, out of anger or greed, because these two are
the gateways to hell. , 7

Here the word 'Api' has been used, two times by Arjuna. It
means, first why should they kill me when I do not create any
obstacle to their selfish motive? Even then suppose, they slay
me, by thinking that I worked as an obstacle to their selfish
motive, I do not seek to slay them. Secondly, though there is
no possibility for the sovereignty of the three worlds coming to
me by killing them, yet, if I get it, I do not seek to slay them.

""Madhusiidana'*—It means that you killed the demons, such
as Madhu etc. But these teachers, such as Drona etc., and grand-
uncles, such as Bhisma etc., are not demons, they are our near
and dear ones. So, why should J have a desire to kill them?

* Lord Krsna is called Madhustdana because he killed the demon
named Madhu. 4 |
"

 ‘Acaryah'—I should serve respected and benevolent teachers,
such as Drona etc., rather than fight them. It is appropriate on
our part, even to sacrifice out lives at their feet. | |

or greed, when we have got this body linked with them?
'Putrah'—It is our duty to bring up our sons and our brother's
sons, even though they may stand against us or act badly.
'Pitamahah'—When our grand-uncles are worthy of adoration,
as our father, they deserve still greater adoration, from us. Though,
they may rebuke and punish us, yet we should not cause any
suffering to them, we should rather serve them and give comfort
to them. |
'Matulah'—Our maternal uncles, being the brothers of our

O Janardana, (Janardana, the name of Sri Krsna, means
a person who is worshipped by people for prosperity and
emancipation), what delight can we derive by slaying the
sons of Dhrtarastra? Sin alone will attach us by slaying these
desperadoes. 36
Comment:— |
""Nihatya dhartarastrannah ka pritih syajjanardana papameva-
Srayedasmanhatvaitanatatayinah—We cannot derive even the
slightest joy, by slaying the sons of Dhrtarastra.and the warriors
of their army. If we kill them, out of anger or greed, we shall
have to repent, because the memory of those kinsmen will obsess
us and the grief of their death, will torment us. We cannot get
| joy in this world, by killing them and sin will accrue, to us in
the next world, which will torment us there. |
There are six kinds of desperadoes—one who sets fire, who
poisons, who murders, who seizes wealth, who usurps kingdoms
and those who kidnap others’ wives.* . |
Duryodhana and his companions have committed all these
criminal offences. They secretly set fire to the residence, where
' Pandavas were expected to be sleeping, they poisoned Bhima
and threw him into water; they made an attempt on the life of
Pandavas; while gambling, deceitfully they deprived Pandavas
of their wealth and kingdom, and in the assembly, Duryodhana
insulted Draupadi, by calling her his waiting-maid and persuaded
Jayadratha to kidnap Draupadi, and he kidnapped her.
In the scriptures, it is mentioned that there is no sin in killing
a desperado (Manusmrti 8/351). But, it is also mentioned in the
scriptures, that non-violence is of great virtue. Therefore, why
should we slay our kith and kin, out of anger and greed?
Though Duryodhana etc., being desperadoes, deserve to be
killed, yet sin will accrue tous as a result of such action, because
they are our kith and kin. It is mentioned in the scriptures, that
* Vasistha smrti 3/19
"
94,"Verse 37] — SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 5]
one who kills his kith and kin, is a great sinner. So how can we
kill them? Therefore, it is better to break off our relationship with
them, rather than to kill them. In the same way, as relationship
could be cut off from a son, but he cannot be slain.

| Although these people, with their understanding (discrimination)
clouded by greed do not perceive the evil of destruction of their
own families and the sin accruing from enmity towards friends,
yet O Janardana (Krsna), why should we, who see clearly the sin
involved, in the destruction of the family, not think of turning
away from such a sin? 38-39 |
Comment:—

""Yadyapyete na paSyanti lobhopahatacetasah kulaksayakrtam
dosarn mitradrohe ca patakam'—Greed, consists in desiring to
have more and more of wealth, property, praise, respect and
rank. It is because of greed, that Duryodhana etc., lost discretion
and so they do not think about the disastrous consequences of
war and the sin, that will accrue out of it. :

This extraordinary greed, had deprived them of their sense
of discretion, and little do they realize, that the kingdom for
which they are bent upon committing the sin of destroying their
kith and kin, will not stay long, with them. The pleasure of
possession, is soon followed by the pain of deprivation, which
far outweighs the pleasure of possession: With minds clouded
by greed for the kingdom they do not perceive the deadly sin,
"
96,"Verse 38-39] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI - 53
which will arise by destroying their own families.

A battle causes loss of time, energy, life and property, and
people are assailed by worries and hardships. When there is a
quarrel between two friends, they turn into enemies. Drupada
and Drona had been friends since childhood. After getting the
kingdom one day Drupada insulted Drona, with the result, that
their friendship turned into enmity. To avenge his insult Drona
got Drupada defeated by his pupil, Arjuna, and thus got half of
his kingdom. Then Drupada, got a holy sacrifice performed to
destroy Drona, and thus both Dhrstadyumna and Draupadi, were
born. Thus, they do not perceive the evil of destruction of the
race, and the sin, that will accrue from enmity towards friends.

We managed life well, without things which we do not
possess. The paucity of things was not so painful as it is, if we
miss those things, after possessing them. But these things can be
with us for a short time, only, because these can stay with us so
long as our fortune favours us, and then they, slip away. Thus,
we remain the same as we were, without getting these. We had
to work hard to get them and are now sad, after losing them.
After getting them, we felt somewhat happy, only because of
our greed. If we do not have this evil of greed, we can never be
happy after getting the things. Similarly, we get happiness from
members of our family, because of love and delusion. Thus, we
see that we derive worldly pleasure out of evil. Without evil, no
worldly pleasure is possible. If there is no greed, there cannot
be any pleasure, in accumulation of wealth. Greed destroys our
discretion, and we cannot think in the right perspective.

""Katham na jiieyamasmabhih prapasyadbhirjanardana'—Arjuna
says—""Though Duryodhana etc., do not perceive any guilt in
the extermination of their family, and sin accruing from enmity
towards friends yet we should desist from such a sin. (It will
"
97,"54 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 1
be described from the 40th verse to the 44th verse), because
we know it very well, that destruction of family is an evil, and
enmity towards friends, is a sin. If those friends cause up pain,

| it will not be harmful for us, because pain will destroy our sins
and purify us. But, if we have feelings of malice and enmity,
those feelings remain with us, in other births also, will instigate
us to commit sins and lead us to, degradation. Therefore, we
should certainly forsake such a sin.

Here, Arjuna is thinking about the greed of Duryodhana
etc., but he is not thinking about his own, infatuation and
delusion. So he cannot understand his duty. It is a rule, that a

| man cannot perceive his failings as long he perceives defects,
in others. He feels rather proud of his superiority, that he has
no defect, while the fact is that, everyone generally, possesses
one defect or the other. If we find fault with others, it is also
a defect. Beings proud of one's own virtues and finding fault
with others are the two defects which we do not perceive in us,
though we do possess these. Thus Arjuna cannot perceive his
own infatuation and delusion, because he is finding fault with
Duryodhana, and is proud of his virtue (all evils persist under
the cover of pride). |

Comment:—

""Kulaksaye pranaSyanti kuladharmah sanatanah'—In a war,
there is destruction of family. The family has its agelong traditions
and time-honoured usage. But when a family is destroyed, its
pious traditions and usage, which lead the living and dead
members of the family to benediction, also perish, because no
one remains, to maintain these. .

""Dharme naste kular krtsnamadharmo'bhibhavatyuta'—When
pious traditions and pious conduct, perish, people lose their virtues
and righteousness, and impiety takes hold of an entire family.

Now the doubt arises, how impiety takes hold of the family

| when it is destroyed. The answer is, that when people who wage
war are killed, impiety takes hold of the children and women,
who do not take part in battle, but are left behind. The reason
is that when fit and experienced persons die in battle, no one
is left behind to control the children and women, and to teach
them good conduct and virtuous behaviour. So they do not
behave decently that is supposed to mark, righteous persons. So
impiety takes hold of them.

and placid (sattviki). Intellect has discrimination between right
and wrong. But, when there is growth of impiety, in family, the
conduct of members in the family, becomes bad. Bad conduct
fouls the inner sense whose inner sense, makes the intellect
'tamasi' (the intellect which veils knowledge and binds one to
carelessness is called ‘tamasi'). With this ""Tamasi' intellect, men
lose discrimination, regard the undesirable as desirable, and the
desirable as undesirable and act against ordinance of scriptures.
With such an intellect women become depraved viz., unchaste.

: 'Strisu dustasu varsneya jayate varnasankarah'—Depraved
women give birth to hybrids.* If man and woman belong to
different castes, the offspring born of the couple, is known as
a hybrid, (mixture). |

Here, Arjuna by addressing the Lord as ‘Krsna’, means to
say that He attracts everyone. He further asks him, in which
direction, He will pull his family.

Arjuna addresses him as Varsneya, because He belonged to
the Vrsni clan. He means to say, to what clan will his descendants
belong, when destruction of his clan, takes place? Therefore, it
is not proper to destroy the clan. |

Comment:— a : ,

‘Sankaro narakayaiva kulaghnanam kulasya ca'—The
offsprings, that are born of an intermixture of castes, are not
religious-minded and do not possess righteousness and rectitude,
because they themselves are the product of persons, without
virtue. So they behave against traditions and decorum of a race.
Those who kill persons of a race war are called destroyers of the
race. Such persons, lead not only themselves but also the whole
race, to hell, because of destruction of traditions, of the race.

'Patanti pitaro hyesam luptapindodakakriyah'—The manes of
the destroyers of a race, fall because they do not get the ritual
offerings of rice-balls (Pinda) and water from them. The reason
is, that when they get these offerings, because of those virtuous
actions, they go to higher worlds. But, when they do not get
those offerings, they cannot continue to live in those worlds and
they are degraded.

A descendant, who is a hybrid has no regard for his ancestors,
and he has no sentiment to offer anything, to them. Moreover,
even if he offers anything, such as obsequies, as a social custom,
without any regard and against the ordinance of scriptures, that is
not received by the manes. The reason is, that he is not eligible
to perform such rites. So they have a fall.

Appendix—There are two types of manes—‘ajana’ and
‘martya’. The manes who live in the world of manes are ‘ajana’,
while the manes who go to the world of manes after dying
from the human-world are ‘martya’. The ‘martya’ manes being
deprived of the ritual offerings of rice-balls and water, have a
downfall. Only those ‘martya’ manes have a downfall who have
affinity for the family and offspring and expect to receive the
ritual offerings of rice-balls and water.

of knowledgé), ‘yogasastra’ (the discipline of action) and
| ‘Stikrsnarjuna sarnvada’ (the discipline of devotion)—the three
have been included. | :
“Jn the Gita ‘Srikrsnarjuna sarhvada’ viz., the dialogue between
Lord Krsna and Arjuna begins with devotion and ends in devotion.
In the beginning Arjuna, being confused with regard to his duty,
takes refuge in God——‘Sisyaste’ harh Sadhi marh tvarh prapannam’
(Gita 2/7) and in the end being inspired by the Lord for taking
refuge in Him alone, by the expression ‘mamekarh Saranarh vraja’,
Arjuna takes refuge in Him alone, when he declares—‘karisye
vacanam tava’ (I will do your bidding). Arjuna asked Lord Krsna
| the means by which he might attain the highest good (Gita 2/7,
3/2, 5/1). Therefore the Lord has also described ‘“Jnanayoga’
(the discipline of knowledge) and ‘Karmayoga’ (the discipline
of action) in the Gita. :

Comment:— | |

""Aho bata mahatpapam kartum vyavasita vayam yadrajya-
sukhalobhena hanturh svajanamudyatah'—Duryodhana and his
companions, are villains. Being goaded by greed, they are not
guided by righteousness and so they are prepared to wage a
war. We have the power to discriminate between righteousness
and unrighteousness, virtue and vice, but we are also prepared

| to wage war to kill our own kinsmen, just like ignorant people.
So it is something very surprising and shocking. By doing so,
we are going to commit a great sin, by turning a deaf ear to the

: teachings of preceptors and scriptures.

The word 'Aho' expresses surprise. It is surprising, that we
have decided to commit sin by waging this war, even having
known its horrifying consequences. The word ‘Bata’, expresses
sorrow. It is a matter of sorrow, that we are prepared to slay
our kith and kin, being over powered by greed, for a transient
kingdom and pleasure.

_. Greed for kingdom and pleasure, is the only cause, for
"
104,"Verse 45] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 61
perpetrating the great sin of killing our kinsmen. It means, that
if we get victory in the battle, we shall get kingdom, wealth,
honour, glory, power, pleasure and luxuries. Such greed for
kingdom and enjoyment, is totally unjustified for such people
as us. |

In this verse, Arjuna wants to say that a man can carry out
the behest of scriptures and teachers etc., only by honouring his
own good ideas, and his own knowledge. But he who dishonours
them, cannot adopt virtuous principles of scriptures and teachers.
Thus good thoughts and ideas do not arise up in him. Then, who
can check him from possessing evil thoughts and performing evil
actions? Similarly, if we disregard our knowledge, who can check
us from committing the great sin of killing our kinsmen?

Here, Arjuna is thinking about the disastrous consequences
cf war and so he is not willing to wage it. But he is not thinking
that his feelings of attachment, selfishness and delusion for the
family, are responsible for his behaviour which is totally wrong
for a thoughtful, righteous and brave member, of the warrior-
class.

[Arjuna in the thirty-eighth verse states that Duryodhana
etc., with mind blinded by greed do not perceive the evil of
destruction of their own clan and the sin accruing from enmity
towards friends. Here, he says that goaded by the greed for
throne and enjoyment, they themselves are prepared to commit
a great sin. It proves that Arjuna knows that greed is the cause
of sins. But, in the thirty-sixth verse of the third chapter, he
asks, ""Impelled by what does a man commit sin, unwillingly?
And why?"" The answer is, that he has a feeling of attachment

_and affection for the family, so he wants to turn away from war.
He thinks, that greed is the root cause of the sin of destruction
of one's own clan. But, by hearing the gospel of the Gita, he
"
105,"62 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 1

wants to know the path or discipline by pursuing which, he may
: obtain the highest good—the supreme bliss (Gita 3/2). So, in the

third chapter he asks, which is the force that impels a man to

abandon his duty viz., (in 3/36) Arjuna, asks the question as a

striver, about his duty, not as a person, having attachment for

his family.]

It would, indeed, be better for me, if the sons of Dhrtarastra

unarmed and unresisting. 46
Comment:—

""Yadi mamapratikaramasastram Sastrapanayah dhartarastra
rane hanyustanme ksemataram bhavet'—Arjuna says, ""If I turn
away from the war, perhaps our opponents will also desist from
it. Why will they fight, if we are determined not to fight? But
even if, regarding us as their enemy, they zealously, armed with
weapons kill me, that will indeed be in my own interest, as it
will be a kind of repentance for the determination, which I had
made, in the war to kill my preceptors, and I shall be purified
of the sins. It means that if I do not wage war, I will escape
sin and my. race, will not be destroyed.""

[When a man talks about a subject, it has its effect, on him
also. When Arjuna, possessed by extreme passion, started to
"
106,"Verse 46] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 63
speak in sadness, in the twenty-eighth verse, he was not so much
overwhelmed with grief as he was now. Then, Arjuna did not turn
away from war, but went on speaking, overwhelmed with grief.
But at last, he turns away from war, and sits down having laid
down his bow and arrow. Lord Krsna did not speak, to enable
Arjuna to give an outlet for his feelings of sadness completely,
because he knew, that his teachings would be of some avail to
him, only when there was an outlet for his sorrow.]
oe

Worldly people will support the arguments adduced by
Arjuna, but they will not agree with Lord Krsna, who will justify
war later. The reason is, that as Arjuna is full of attachment
and love, the worldly people also belong to the same class. So
they cannot understand the point of view, expressed by Lord
Krsna, who always thinks about the welfare and benediction of
beings. They will say that Arjuna wanted to escape the sin, by
not waging war, but it was Lord Krsna, who inspired him to
wage war. So, it was not proper on His part, to do so.

The fact is, that Lord Krsna did not make Arjuna wage
war. He reminded him of his duty only. It was Arjuna, who had
invited Lord Krsna, to the war front. But seeing his kinsmen on
the hostile side, he was turning away from his duty. So Lord
Krsna reminded him not to neglect his duty, out of delusion
but to wage war, because there was nothing more welcome to
a member of the warrior-class than a righteous war.

For example; if a man is going to Badrinarayana, but by
mistake he starts going in the opposite direction. He then happens
to meet a person, who asks him where he was going. The latter,
tells him that he has taken the wrong direction, so he should turn
back, in order to reach his destination. Here, the person shows
"
107,"64 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 1
the right direction (way), to the man who had lost it. Similarly,
Lord Krsna showed Arjuna the right direction, of his duty.
After seeing his kinsmen arrayed, on the war front, Arjuna
said to Lord Krsna, ""I will not fight"" (2/9). But after hearing
the gospel of Lord Krsna he did not say ""I'll not fight"" but he
said, ""I will carry out your bidding"" (18/73) viz., ""I will do my
duty."" It shows, that Lord Krsna reminded him of his duty.
The fact is, that war was inevitable because Lord Krsna
Himself, while revealing his supreme divine form to Arjuna,
said, ""I am the mighty world-destroying time, the destroyer of
the world. My purpose here is to destroy these people. Even if
you do not kill them, all those warriors arrayed in the enemy's
camp, will not survive"" (11/32). Thus this destruction of human
beings was inevitable, even if Arjuna did not fight. If Arjuna
did not fight, Yudhisthira, who with his four brothers married
Draupadi by obeying his mother, would certainly fight by obeying
her. Similarly, Bhima would never deviate from the war because
he had already taken a pledge to kill the Kauravas. As far as
Draupadi is concerned, she had even said, that if her husbands,
the Pandavas did not fight, her father (Drupada), her brother
(Dhrstadyumna), her five sons and Abhimanyu, would fight against
the Kauravas*. All these facts, show that the war was inevitable.
A man cannot control the happenings that are pre-destined.
By discharging his duty one can attain salvation, but by neglecting
it, he can degrade himself. It means that man is free to attain,
either desirable or undesirable results. Therefore, Lord Krsna, by
reminding Arjuna of his duty, has preached to human beings,
that they should always discharge their duty, by following the
ordinance of scriptures and never turn away from these.

Arjuna, grief stricken on the battlefield, having spoken thus,
and having laid down his bow and arrow, slumped into the central
part of the chariot. 47 |
Comment:—

‘Evamuktvarjunah sankhye rathopastha upavisat visrjya
saSaram capam Sokasamvignamanasah'—War, is the root cause
of all evils. It will destroy a race and will lead us to hell in the
next world. By thinking so Arjuna, overwhelmed with sorrow,
became firmly determined not to wage war. Arjuna, who had
come to the battlefield with great zeal with Gandiva bow in
his hand, put the bow and arrow down, and overwhelmed with
sorrow, sat on the seat of the chariot. | .

The main reason of Arjuna's grief, is that when Lord Krsna
placed the chariot between the two armies and asked Arjuna,
to behold the Kauravas, he saw Bhisma and Drona standing in
front of him. So his attachment was aroused. Thus, he thought
about the destruction of his race (which Duryodhana etc., did
not perceive being goaded by greed) and the sin, accruing from
it. Then he said that, even if the warriors of the hostile army
killed him, while he was unarmed and unresisting, that would
be for his good. Thus empowered by delusion, Arjuna perceives
"
109,"66 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter I
good in turning away from war, and even in his death and finally
having abandoned his bow and arrow and overwhelmed with
grief, sits on the middle seat of the chariot. Thus, we see that
it is delusion, which changes a hero's (Arjuna’s), great courage
to consternation.

Thus with the words, Om, Tat, Sat—the names of the Lord
as sung in the Upanisad of the Bhagavadgita by the Lord, the
science of Brahma, the scripture on Yoga, the dialogue between
Sri Krsna and Arjuna, ends the first chapter entitled, 'The Yoga
of Dejection of Arjuna’.

The colophon at the end of each chapter, written by sage
Veda Vyasa reveals the glory and greatness of the Gita. ‘Om,
Tat, Sat'*—this has been declared as the triple designation of
the Absolute. These three names, lead the beings to benediction
and turn us towards God and spirituality and break off our
relationship with the world. These wash away the mistakes, which
we might have committed in pronouncing the verses, words and
letters, in the chapter. So these three are pronounced at the end
of each chapter.

By 'Om' sage Veda Vyasa means, that this may wash away
the mistakes of the verses, ""Tat' may turn his verses towards God,
and 'Sat' means, that these verses may give an imperishable fruit.
'Iti', means that he has no other personal motive besides this one.

The Gita has been called 'Srimad’ because it possesses
paramount beauty, and it is called 'Stimadbhagavad', because

* Vide—Gita 17/23—27
"
110,"SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 67
it has been uttered by Lord Krsna, who possesses six: 'Bhagas'’
i.e., divine traits—wealth, virtue, glory, greatness, knowledge
and dispassion. .

It has been called the Gita, because it has been sung by the
Lord Himself. According to the rules of Sarnskrta grammar,
it should have been called 'Gitam', yet it being the essence of
Upanisads, in feminine gender, it has been called the ‘Gita.’

The essence of all Upanisads, is contained in it and it
has emanated from the tongue of the Lord Himself, so it is
called ‘Upanisad.’ |

It is called 'Brahmavidya (Supreme Knowledge), because it
leads the living being, to benediction without any distinction of
caste, creed and colour. It is called 'YogaSastra’ because different
Yogas (Disciplines), such as Karmayoga (the Discipline of
Disinterested Action), Jnanayoga (the Discipline of Knowledge),
Dhyanayoga (the Discipline of Meditation) and Bhaktiyoga
(the Discipline of Devotion), are contained in it. By following
anyone of these disciplines a striver, can realize his identity with
God (Paramatma).

It is a dialogue, between Lord Krsna and the devotee Arjuna.
Arjuna has asked questions without hesitation, and Lord Krsna
has answered them with generosity. So it is called a dialogue
between Sri Krsna and Arjuna. |

In the first chapter, there is description of Arjuna's dejection.
By the company of God and saints, this dejection may create
dispassion and thus may lead to benediction. Though Duryodhana,
also possessed dejection, yet having disinclination for God, his
dejection is not called ‘Yoga’. But it is called Yoga, in the case
of Arjuna as he could realize his identity with God, by means
of this 'Yoga.' So this chapter is entitled ""The Yoga of Dejection
of Arjuna.’
"

_| Second Chapter
INTRODUCTION

Duryodhana mentioned the great warriors of the two armies,
but Dronacarya did not utter a word. So Duryodhana became
sad. Then, Bhisma blew: his conch loudly to cheer Duryodhana.
Hearing the sound of his conch, the conchs, drums and cow-
horns etc., of the Kaurava and the Pandava armies blared forth.
After this (from the twentieth verse) the dialogue between Lord
Krsna and Arjuna began.

Arjuna asked Lord Krsna, to place his chariot in the midst
of the two armies. The Lord, having placed the chariot between
the two armies, in front of Bhisma and Drona etc., asked Arjuna
to behold the Kurus. Having seen his kinsmen, he was filled
with compassion and sadness, that he cast away his bow and
arrows, and slumped into the seat of the chariot.

The second chapter starts with Safijaya telling Dhrtarastra,
what Lord Krsna had said to Arjuna, when he was overwhelmed
with grief.

addressed the following words to Arjuna, who was overwhelmed

with tears of despondence. 1
"
113,"70 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
Comment:— |

‘Tam tatha krpayavistam'—Arjuna advises Lord Krsna to
place his chariot in between the two armies, so that he may
behold the war-minded warriors who dared to risk their lives,
by fighting against such a valiant warrior, as he. But the same
heroic and zealous Arjuna, at the sight of his kinsmen, becomes
overwhelmed with grief, his limbs give way, his mouth is parched,
his body shivers, his hairs stand on end, his bow slips, from his
hand, his skin burns all over and his mind reels. His bravery
turns into faint-heartedness and he slips into the seat of the
chariot. Safijaya, conveys the same feelings of Arjuna, who was
drowned in distress and despondency. © os

‘ASrupirnakuleksanam'—Such a valiant warrior, Arjuna was
full of familial attachment and his eyes were full of tears, that
he could not even see, clearly.

'Visidantamidam vakyamuvaca madhusiidanah'—Lord Krsna
(Madhusudana), said the following words (the words which will
be repeated in the second and third verses) to Arjuna, who was
overwhelmed with grief because of his loss of courage.

Here, ""Visidantamuvaca’ was enough, because the word
""Vakyam’' is also included in the verb ‘'Uvaca’. But the word
""Vakyam' has a special meaning. These words of Lord Krsna,
are very profound and uncommon. These attack Arjuna’'s faint-
heartedness and despondency, which overpowered Arjuna, in the
discharge of his duty. They make him aware of his weakness
and arouse in him a desire for benediction. It is because of these
profound words of Lord Krsna, that Arjuna by becoming His
disciple and seeks refuge in Him (2 /7).

Sanjaya by using the word 'Madhustdana’, means to say
that Lord Krsna is the killer of demon, Madhu 1.e., He is the
destroyer of people having a villainous nature, and so He will
certainly destroy wicked natured Duryodhana, and his group.

Arjuna, how has this affliction overtaken you at this odd
hour? It is shunned by noble souls; neither could it bring heaven
nor fame to you. 2
Comment:— |

(‘Arjuna—Lord Krsna, addresses him as ‘Arjuna’ which means,
pure in heart. The Lord means to say, how he has become faint-
hearted, when it is quite unbecoming of him.]

'Kutastva| kaSmalamidam visame samupasthitam'—Lord
Krsna, being surprised asks Arjuna, why he has developed
faint-heartedness, instead of valour and zeal, at this juncture. A
man is surprised in two ways—out of his own ignorance, and
as a warning to others. Lord Krsna's surprise here is, a warning
to Arjuna, so that he may be aware of his duty.

‘Kutah' means that this faint-heartedness is not permanent in
him, it is only a temporary phase, which will go away.

‘Samupasthitam’ means, you are faint-hearted, not only in
words and feelings, but also in actions, you are overcome by
this faint-heartedness and therefore you sat in the middle of the
chariot, after abandoning your bow and arrows.

* The Lord is called ""Bhagavan' because he possesses six ‘Bhagas’ (divine
traits). They are wealth, virtue, glory, greatness, knowledge and dispassion.
"
115,"72 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter2

'Anaryajustam'— Great people do not become faint-hearted,
they shun the feeling because, it does not lead them, to any good.

Great men who want to achieve success do so with fixed
objectives, during activity as well as non-activity. They do not
shirk their duty. According to prevailing circumstances, they
perform their duty thoroughly, with zeal and readiness, in order
to achieve emancipation. So, it is not proper on his part to refrain
from the duty of fighting, because of cowardice.

‘Asvargyam'—If we leave aside the goal of success and
consider the matter from a worldly point of view, the attainment
of heaven, is the highest achievement. With this timidity you

| cannot even attain the heaven.

'‘Akirtikaram'—Even without having the aim of attainment
of heaven, a noble person performs those deeds which bring him
name and fame in the world. But this cowardice would defame
you. So it does not befit you at all, to be faint-hearted.

Here, the Lord by giving these three expressions 'Anaryajustam’,

| ‘Asvargyam’ and 'Akirtikaram’, in a sequence has explained that
there are three types of persons (i) Thoughtful—whose aim is to
attain benediction, (ii) Virtuous—who by doing virtuous actions
want to attain heaven, (iii) and Ordinary—-who want name and
fame in the world. So, by giving the above-mentioned three
kind, Lord Krsna wants to warn Arjuna that, his affliction would
bring him neither benediction, nor heaven nor fame, but would
degrade and defame him, and lead him to hell.

Comment:—

‘Partha'*—Lord Krsna addresses Arjuna as 'Partha’,, to remind
him of Mother Kunti's messagef and arouse in him feelings of
bravery which befits the members of a warrior-class. It means,
that he should not disobey his mother by showing cowardice.

'Klaibyarn ma sma gamah'—It is because of faint-heartedness
that Arjuna perceives it, righteous not to wage war and unrighteous
to wage war. Therefore to warn him, Lord Krsna says that it
is impotence rather than righteousness, not to wage war. So he
should abandon this weakness.

'Naitattvayyupapadyate'— You should not have developed this __
timidity in you, because you are, the son of a brave mother of
warrior-class, and you yourself are also brave. Therefore, this
weakness does not befit you at all. |

'‘Parantapa'—You are the scorcher and vanquisher of foes.
So, will you gladden your enemies by showing your disinclination
for war?

'Ksudram hrdayadaurbalyam tyaktvottistha'—Here, 'Ksudram’,
has two meanings—(1) This faint-heartedness will make you lowly
viz., it will deprive you of salvation, heaven or fame and if you

* Being the son of Prtha Arjuna is called ‘Partha’. This word manifests
intimacy between Lord Krsna and Arjuna. In the Gita Lord Krsna has used this
address thirty-eight times, more than any other address. The second place goes
to 'Kaunteya' which has been used twenty-four times.

When Lord Krsna wants to say something special or give assurance to Arjuna
or there is an overflow of love for him, He calls him ‘Partha.’ By addressing him
thus, he wants to remind him that besides being the son of his father's sister, he is
his loving devotee and friend (Gita 4/3). Therefore He tells him something very
secret and true for his welfare. ,

+ Kunti's message to Arjuna and to Bhima who were ever eager to fight—

It is the time for which the mother of the warrior-class gives birth to her sons.
"
117,"74 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
do not abandon it, you will become insignificant. (ii) This faint-
heartedness, is petty. So it is not difficult for a brave person
like you to abandon.

You are thinking that being virtuous, you do not want to
commit a sin by waging war, but it is your cowardice. So by
abandoning it, you should discharge your duty, by arraying
yourself to wage war.

Lord Krsna knows for certain, that it is Arjuna’s first
and foremost duty to wage war. So, He, without caring for
Arjuna's lame excuses, orders him quickly to wage war, with
full preparations.

Appendix—This fact has been described in detail by the
Lord ahead from the thirty-first verse to the thirty-eighth verse
of this chapters.

against the war. But without attaching importance to his
arguments, Lord Krsna suddenly scolded Arjuna for his faint-

such as Madhu etc., and foes also who always are jealous of
others, without rhyme or reason. But how can he kill his great
well-wisher, the respected grandfather Bhisma, and adorable
preceptor Drona, who have great affection for him?]

'Katham bhismamaham sankhye dronam ca'—I am not turning
away from war because of faint-heartedness, but because it is
unrighteous for me to fight, with the revered grandsire Bhisma
and venerable teacher Drona. I would be called unmanly if [
were afraid of death. IJ am not afraid of dying but I do not
want to kill my venerable elders, who have always been very
affectionate to me.

Grandfather Bhisma, has loved me since my childhood.
When I addressed him as father, he very affectionately used
to say, that he was my father's father. Similarly, my adorable
preceptor Drona, has been so kind to me that he imparted to
me better training, than he imparted even to his son. He taught
the use of Brahma-weapon, (a kind of weapon which caused
infallible destruction and set in motion by incantation) to both
of us, but as far as its control or end is concerned, he taught
that only to me, not to his son. He also granted me a boon that
no one would excel me, in military science. So it is a mortal
sin, to wage war against them. |

Better to live on alms in this world, than to slay these noble
elders, because after killing them we could enjoy only blood-stained
pleasure, in the form of wealth and sense-objects. 5
Comment:—

[It seems after reading this verse, that the words of Lord
Krsna, uttered in the second and third verses, had some effect on
Arjuna. He is thinking, that though Lord Krsna knows that it is
not justified for him to kill his venerable elders, yet he is unable
to understand why He is ordering him to wage war. So Arjuna,
does not speak with excitement, but speaks, somewhat, politely.]

~ 'Guriinahatva hi mahanubhavan Sreyo bhoktum bhaiksyamapiha
loke'—Arjuna, first presents his point of view, saying that if he
did not fight with reverend Bhisma and Drona etc., Duryodhana
by himself, would not fight with him either. Thus he would lose
his kingdom and suffer. Then he would be leading a life of
misery and could even depend on alms. But he thinks it better
to live on alms, than to slay his reverend elders.

'Tha loke' means—if I live on alms, people in the world will
dishonour, reproach and insult me, but I think accepting alms is
better than killing my reverend preceptors. |

‘Api’ (Even) means—for me slaying the noble preceptors and
"
120,"Verse 5] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 77
living on alms—both are forbidden. But, I think it is more sinful
to kill the preceptors, than to live on alms.

'Hatvarthakamamstu  gurinihaiva bhufijiya bhogan
rudhirapradigdhan'—-If I carry out your command to wage war,
I would enjoy blood-stained pleasure, which will not give me
peace and salvation. : |

Here, a question might arise, that Bhisma and Drona etc.,
preceptors were attached to Kauravas, because of pecuniary
motives. Therefore, what is the objection if ‘Arthakaméan' 1s
taken as an adjective qualifying 'Gurin’. The answer is, that
it is not proper, because they had no desire for money. It was |
incumbent upon them to fight on Duryodhana’'s side, because
they had eaten his salt.

Secondly, Arjuna has used the term 'Mahanubhavan (most
noble). So, how can the most noble souls desire money? Those
who desire money could not be most noble. Therefore, here
‘Arthakaman’, is the adjective which qualifies ‘Bhogan’.

Lord Krsna, in the second and the third verses, orders Arjuna
to array himself by casting off, petty faint-heartedness and fight.
But Arjuna gets him wrong, because he thinks that Lord Krsna
had ordered him to wage war, so that he might enjoy the pleasure
of kingship.* Arjuna however perceived only evil, in waging the
war. He said that it would be better for him, if his opponents
killed him in the war. So with his mind affected by grief he sat
slumped on the seat of the chariot (1/47). He had also said, that
Duryodhana and his companions being goaded by greed, were
prepared to wage war. Now Arjuna says, for himself that if he

* The worldly people having a materialistic outlook cannot even think of
spiritualism. Here Arjuna also being overtaken by family attachment and infatuation
is thinking only of materialism rather than spiritualism. So he is thinking that Lord
Krsna wants him to wage the war so that he may obtain kingdom but Lord Krsna
wants him to attain salvation.
"
121,"78 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
carries out his order and wages war, he will enjoy only blood-
stained pleasure in the form of wealth and sensual enjoyment.
Thus, he perceives nothing but evil, in waging war.

When an evil comes to us, in the form of an evil, it is
easier to do away with it, than when it comes in the garb of
something good. Ravana and devil Kalanemi, could not be
recognized by Sita, and Hanuman respectively, because both of
them disguised themselves, as sages. Similarly, Arjuna perceives

' that it is virtuous not to wage war and it is an evil to wage the
war, but he is completely mistaken. Hence, even Lord Krsna,
finds it difficult and time consuming, to bring Arjuna round, to
the realization of this fact. | |

Today in the name of unity in society, people are determined
to abolish caste, stage of life system (Varna Aérama) thinking
of their action, as virtuous. But they are not thinking about the
disastrous consequences, that this abolition would force the people,
to lead a degraded and demoniacal life. In the same way, in
the accumulation of wealth, people do not perceive falsehood,
fraud, dishonesty, knavery. and treachery etc., as evils. Thus,
here for Arjuna also, an evil of unmanliness has disguised itself,
as righteousness and thus he says how he can slay his noble —

elders. It means, that whatever Arjuna considers a virtue, is in

fact, an evil. But, it does not appear to him, to be an evil, as in

the abandonment of his duty, has crept in the guise of virtue of
nonviolence, because of his attachment for his relatives.

Appendix—The feelings of elders and preceptors such as
Bhisma and Drona etc., are noble and pure because even while
waging the war, they have no partiality.

POSES IY

Link:—The holy words of God had a singular effect and
exerted a deep and far reaching influence, on Arjuna, as a result
of which, he starts doubting the correctness of his decision, not
to wage war. In such a state of mind, Arjuna says.

Comment:—

'Na caitadvidmah kataranno gariyah'— I cannot decide
whether | should wage war or not, because you consider it better
to wage war but I do not do so, as it is a sin to kill noble elders
and preceptors.

""Yadva jayema yadi va no jayeyuh'—If I carry out your order
and wage war, we do not know, whether we shall win or lose.

Here, it does not mean that Arjuna has no confidence in his
own power, but he is uncertain about the future, because no one
knows, what may happen in future.

""Yaneva hatva na jijivisimah'—Not to speak of pleasures and
kingdom, we do not even wish to live by killing our kinsmen
because by killing them we shall be bereaved of them and thus
shall suffer pangs of bereavement.

'Te'vasthitah pramukhe dhartarastrah'—Dhrtarastra's sons, are
our kinsmen and they are arrayed against us. So, how can we kill
them? We are damned, if we wish to live, by killing them.

My nature is overwhelmed with the vice of faint-heartedness
and my mind is confused with regard to my duty. I entreat you, tell
me what is decidedly good for me. I am your disciple. Do instruct
me, who have taken refuge, in you. 7
Comment:—

""Karpanyadosopahatasvabhavah prcchami tvam dharma-
sammiidhacetah'—Arjuna did not think it desirable to turn away
totally, from the war, but to escape the sin, he did not find any
other alternative. So he wanted to turn away from war and he
thought of such action, as a virtue, rather than a vice of faint-
heartedness. But, when Lord Krsna called his action faint-hearted
and unmanly, Arjuna was reminded of his duty, as a member of
the warrior-class for whom it was not befitting to run. So Arjuna
by conceding his faint-heartedness, says that first his nature even
as a member of the warrior-class, was weighed down with the
weakness of faint-heartedness and secondly, his mind was confused
with regard to his duty. Being overpowered by delusion, he could
not take the right decision, about its righteousness.

In the third verse Lord Krsna advised Arjuna, ""Cast off
your petty faint-heartedness and stand up, for war."" So his
doubt should have been removed. But he still had some doubt,
because, on the one hand he thought that it was a sin to kill the
"
124,"Verse 7] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 81
kinsmen and the adorable elders, but on the other hand, being
a member of the warrior-class it was his duty to wage war. So
he was confused with regard to his duty, and he entreats Lord
Krsna to tell him, what his real duty is. | :

'Yacchreyah syanniscitam brithi tanme'—In the second verse
of this chapter, Lord Krsna told him that his dejection was
a shame and it should be shunned by noble souls. So Arjuna
thought, that he should also follow the path, adopted by noble
souls. Therefore, he prays to Lord Krsna, to tell him what is
decidedly good for him.

First Arjuna was agitated and distressed, and he asks what
was good for him. It shows that, an awakening for salvation as
a goal is not aroused in a man, so long as he is satisfied with
his present situation. But when he is dissatisfied and he wants to |
rise above it, he becomes aware of his real aim 1.e., salvation.

'Sisyaste'ham'—When Arjuna entreated Lord Krsna, to tell
him what was decidedly good for him, he thought that such a
question could be put to a teacher, not to a chariot-driver. Arjuna's
conviction, that he was a chriot-warrior, while Krsna was his
charioteer, whom he ordered to place the chariot between the two
armies, had gone. So he becomes His disciple and declares, ""I
am your disciple, so tell me what is decidely, good for me.""

'‘Sddhi mam tvam prapannam'—Arjuna thinks, that the
preceptor can guide the disciple and a disciple will have to
shoulder the responsibility to translate his teachings into practice,
and then make effort to attain salvation. But he wants to hand
over this responsibility, to his preceptor. As the mother of a
breast-sucking child, not the child who falls sick, takes medicine
for his recovery, the teacher take over responsibility of the

_ disciple, who takes refuge in him. So Arjuna, by depending on
the teacher and surrendering to Him says, ""I have taken refuge
in You, instruct me."" | | :

Here, Arjuna by using the phrase ""Tvam prapannam' says,
"
125,"82 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
that he has taken refuge in Him. But actually he had -not taken
completely refuge in Him. Had he done this, he would not
have uttered the words ‘Instruct me’, because a disciple has
no responsibility of his own, the full responsibility lies with
the teacher. Secondly, in the ninth verse he says, ""I shall not
fight.” It also shows that he had not really iaken refuge in Him,

| otherwise he might have not uttered these words. A disciple,
who takes refuge in his teacher has no say, no responsibility
of his own, he becomes merely an instrument, in the hands of
his preceptor and does whatever his teacher wants him, to do.
Therefore, Lord Krsna in the sixty-sixth verse of the eighteenth
chapter says, ""Seek refuge in Me, alone"" (18/66). Then Arjuna,
in the seventy-third verse of the eighteenth chapter says, ""I shall
act according to Your word."" It is here, that Arjuna really takes
refuge, in Him.

In this verse, there are four points spoken by Arjuna, which
need attention—

(i) My nature is weighed down, with the vice of faint-
heartedness and I entreat you because my mind is confused with
regard to my duty. (ii) Tell me he entreats, what is decidedly
good for me. (it) I am Your disciple. (iv) Instruct me who has
taken refuge in You. If we think over these four points, one
by one, we realise that as far as the first point is concerned,
the person to whom the question is asked, is free, whether he
answers the question or not. The second point, shows that it 1s
his duty to answer. In the third, the responsibility to guide the
disciple, so that he may attain salvation is that of the teacher.
In the fourth, the full responsibility for salvation of the disciple,
is the teacher's.

Link:— In the previous verse, Arjuna takes refuge in Lord
Krsna, but he thinks that Lord Krsna wants him to wage the war,
which he regards as unrighteous and so He will again order him
"
126,"Verse 8] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI | 83
to wage war. Secondly, he thinks that perhaps he has not been
able to convey his feelings to Him. So in the next verse, Arjuna
clearly expresses his feelings to Him, against the war.

{Arjuna thinks Lord Krsna, wants him to wage war, so that
he may gain victory and kingdom, and thus his grief may be

‘Avapya bhimavasapatnamrddham rajyam'—Even if I obtain
- an undisputed sovereignty and affluent kingdom, on this earth,
and my subjects become happy and prosperous, and I may have
no enemy on the face of earth, it will fail to remove my grief.
‘Suranamapi cadhipatyam'—Not to talk of worldly pleasure,
even lordship of Indra (the king of the gods) over the gods,
cannot remove my worry and grief. In verses, thirty-two and thirty-
three of the first chapter, Arjuna wanted to turn away from war,
because of his attachment for his kinsmen. But here, he wants to
turn away from war because he thinks that it 1s an obstacle, to
salvation. So there is a lot of difference, between the two situations.
"

""Na hi prapasyami mamapanudyad yacchokamucchosana-

grieved over the loss of a kingdom, it might be overcome by
gaining it. But I am grieved at thinking of the massacre of my
kinsmen. If I gain a kingdom, it will rather enhance my grief,
because who could enjoy the kingdom, after the death of my
kinsmen? Therefore, undisputed sovereignty and an affluent
kingdom on. this earth and lordship over the gods cannot remove
the grief, that is parching my senses. -

providing him with an affluent kingdom, honour and fame. But
it would not wipe out his grief, worry and misery. Therefore,
it was not befitting for him to wage war. So Arjuna speaks his
mind in clear words ""I'll not fight."" ,

Having declared his decision not to fight, and having nothing

senayorubhayormadhye  visidantamidam  vacah

O Bharata (Dhrtarastra, born in Bharata dynasty), Sri Krsna,
as if smiling, addressed the following words to the despondent
Arjuna while in the midst of the two armies. 10
Comment:— | |

""Tamuvaca hrsikeSah prahasanniva bharata senayorubhayo-
rmadhye visidantamidarh vacah'—Agjuna filled with valour and
enthusiasm, had entreated Lord Krsna to place his chariot
between the two armies, so that he could behold the warriors.
It was befitting for Arjuna, to get ready for fighting which was

his objective. But there, instead of waging war, he felt grieved.

So Lord Krsna, started the gospel of the Gita.

‘Prahasanniva'—(Smiling, as it were) means, that when Lord
Krsna perceived that Arjuna’s enthusiasm for the war, had changed
into grief, he smiled. Secondly, in the seventh verse he said, ""Do
instruct me who have, taken refuge in You"". But in the ninth
verse he says, ""I'll not fight"". So Lord Krsna smiled, because
the devotee who takes refuge in his preceptor, just becomes an
instrument in the hands of his preceptor and a preceptor is fully
"
129,"86 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
responsible for the duty of the disciple. The disciple, has no
option but to obey his preceptor and do, as his teacher wishes.
Arjuna's declaration, ‘not to fight’ is practically a withdrawal
from his refuge, in the Lord. ‘Iva’, means that Lord Krsna must
have burst into laughter, after hearing Arjuna’s decision of not
fighting, but He spoke smilingly. , ,
When Arjuna said, “I'll not fight"", Lord Krsna, should
have told him to do, as he wished (18/63). But He thought that
Arjuna, was unable to take the right decision, because he was
overwhelmed with grief and worry. So, there was an overflow
of Lord Krsna's love, for him. God instead of paying attention
: to the words of his devotees, judges them by their feelings. So
Lord Krsna, instead of paying attention to Aruna’s words, ""I'll
not fight,"" started the gospel, from the next verse.
Moreover, He accepts those devotees who take refuge in Him,
even by words as his own, because of His boundless grace.
'Hrsikesah'—'Hrsikeéa’, means that the Lord is the indweller
viz., He knows feelings of beings, Lord Krsna knows, that Arjuna
is turning away from war, because he is overpowered by the
urge of attachment for his kinsmen, and he does not see his
grief melting away, by merely acquiring a kingdom. So he says
""Tl not fight."" But, he also knows that as soon as his delusion
is destroyed, he will act upon His instruction. |
In 'Idarn vacah' uvaca, the use of the word ‘Uvaca’ (spoke),
was sufficient, there was no need to use the word ‘Vacah' (word),
because 'Vacah’' is also included in 'Uvaca.' It seems a repetition,
but actually it is not so. The word, 'Vacah' has been used to point |
out, the secret wisdom, contained in the next verse uttered by
Lord Krsna, in simple and easily understandable language.

'  Appendix—On the sacred (righteous) soil of Kuruksetra on
one side the Kaurava-army is arrayed while on the other side
the Pandava-army is arrayed. In the middle of the two armies a
glorious chariot drawn by white horses is placed. In one part of

that chariot Lord Krsna is seated while in another part Arjuna
is seated. The Lord starts preaching the divine gospel for the
benediction of mankind by making Arjuna, an instrument and
first of all He describes the discrimination between the body and.
(the embodied soul) its possessor.

The Blessed Lord said: _

Arjuna, you grieve for those who should not be grieved at,
yet speak as if a man of wisdom. The wise grieve, neither for the
living, nor for the dead. 11 |
Comment:—

[A man is grieved when he classifies objects and persons,
into two divistons—One's own, and not one's own, such as, our
kinsmen and not our kinsmen, of our caste and not of our caste,
of our stage of life and not of our stage of life, our followers and
not our followers. We have a sense of mine, attachment, love
and desire for those, who we regard as ours. Through these—a
sense of mine and desire etc., faults such as grief, worry, fear,
perturbation, commotion and strain etc., arise. The root of all
faults, is a sense. of mine and desire etc., this is a rule.

At the beginning of the Gita, Dhrtarastra asked, ""What did my
sons and the sons of Pandu do?"" It shows his partiality towards
"
131,"88 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
his own.sons and attachment for them, though the Pandavas,
regarded him more than their father. |
_.. Arjuna also developed the same attachment, but he had no
partiality, he was impartial and so he uses the terms ‘Seeing all
these relations’ (1/28) and 'How can we, by killing our own
kinsmen, be happy’ (1/37). It means that, Arjuna had attachment
for the Kuru family, and because of possibility of destruction of
the family, he was grieved. To remove this grief, Lord Krsna
preaches the gospel of the Gita, which begins with this eleventh
verse. In the end, Lord Krsna declares that there is no justification
for Him, to grieve and he should take refuge in Him, alone, and
not grieve—'Grieve not’ (18/66). The reason is, that dependence
on the world leads to grief, while supreme or exclusive devotion
to the Lord, leads to the state which-is free from faults such as
grief and worry etc.] a

'ASocyananvaSocastvam'—There are two things in the
world—real and unreal, the soul and the body. Both of these
are not to be grieved at as the real is imperishable, and therefore,
should not be grieved for and the unreal, is bound to perish, as
it is perishing every moment, so it should not be grieved at. It
means that these are grieved at, only because of ignorance or
lack of discrimination. Whatever circumstances, in the form of
birth-death, profit-loss etc., a man finds himself in, are result of
his fate viz., his previous actions. It is sheer ignorance to feel
happy or sad, in those, favourable or unfavourable circumstances,
because these are transient. )

'Prajiavadamsca bhasase’— On the one hand, you speak words

of wisdom, but on the other hand, you grieve. It shows that you

are merely talking tall, actually you are not wise, because the
wise do not grieve, for anyone.

You also say that with the destruction of a family, its
age old traditions disappear, women become depraved and
there ensues an intermixture of castes, which leads to hell and
"
132,"Verse 11] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 89
deprived of the ritual offerings of rice-balls (Pinda) and water,
their manes also fall—these words, as of the wise, also prove
that a body is perishable, while the soul is imperishable. Had the
soul not been imperishable, how could you have feared the fall
of the killers and members of the family? Further, you would
not have worried about the fall of manes. Your worry and fear
prove, that a body is perishable while its master, the soul is
eternal. So it is not right to grieve for them.

'Gatasiinagatasumsca'—It is out of ignorance, that you
grieve for the bodies because these will-all perish. You should
not lament for them. Such grief is a mistake. |

| It is also a great mistake to grieve for those who are dead
because they. suffer torture, if their people, grieve for them. The
departing soul has to drink and eat the tears and phlegm* shed
by people here. Similarly, we should not grieve or worry for
those who are living, because grief (worry) does not help them,
in anyway. We should rather care for and help them.

Arjuna's limbs were giving way and his mouth was getting
parched. The root of such feelings, is his identity with the body.
Such identity creates affinity for those who nurse this body.
That affinity gives birth to grief and worry in thinking of their
death. So one is grieved (worried) and sad after thinking of
those, who are living as well as those who are dead. One is
grieved (worried) about the dead because deprived of the ritual
offerings of rice-balls and water, the manes, have a downfall —
(1/42), and he is worried about the living ones, because they
are arrayed on the battlefield, staking their lives and property
(1/33). Both types of worries relate to their bodies. So they are
of the same character.

* The departing soul has to eat and drink the phlegm and tears shed by the
relatives. So we should not lament the death of a relative but should perform
obsequies (Paficatantra, Mitrabheda 365).

The departing soul hereafter drinks the tears shed by the relatives here
(Skanda Purana, Brahma. Setu. 48/42).
"
133,"90 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2

_: Instead of grieving, for those who are dead, we should offer
ritual water and rice-balls.etc., because it is our duty. Similarly,
we should make arrangement to care for those who are living.
So we should give a serious thought to it which enables us to
understand our duty, while worry (grief), destroys the power of
thinking. | | .

_ ""NanuSocanti panditah'—Discrimination between the real and
: the unreal, is called ‘Panda’ (wisdom), and one who has developed
discrimination, is known as 'Pandita’ (wise). Such wise men do
not grieve, because they can discriminate between the real and
the unreal—the imperishable self (soul) and the perishable body.
Grief arises, only when the unreal is accepted as real 1.e., when
there is a desire to maintain the body forever. For the real, there

is no grief or worry, at all. ,
| Appendix—tThere is one division of the body (Sarira) while
another division is of the self (Sariri). Both have no relationship
at all with each other. Both are quite different in nature. One is
| insentient while the other is sentient. One is perishable while the
| other is imperishable. One is mutable while the other is immutable.
One is kaleidoscopic while the other remains the same for time
immemorial—‘bhitagramah sa evayarn’ (Gita 8/19), ‘Sarge’ pi

nopajayante pralaye na vyathanti ca’ (Gita 14/2).

_ The body and the self—both are not to be grieved. The
body ever perishes, therefore it is not to be grieved, while the
self never perishes, therefore it is also not to be grieved. One is
grieved only because of one’s own folly. The body is continuously
separating automatically while the self is ever attained to all. The

- wise men who know this distinction between the body and the
self, never grieve for any being whether dead or alive. In their
view the division of the changing body is different from that of
the never changing self i.e., the ever existent entity. |

_ The gospel of the Gita begins with the discrimination between
the body and the self. Other philosophical classics describe the
"
134,"Verse 11] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 91
“self? and the ‘non-self in an objective manner and it becomes
a matter of study but the Gita instead of describing the self and
non-self objectively, describes ‘deha-dehi’, ‘Sarira-Sariti’ (body —
and its owner) on the basis of the personal experience of all
persons. This is uniqueness of the Gita. The striver who wants
to attain salvation first of all must know ‘Who I am’. Arjuna
has also asked Lord Krsna to tell him the highest good for him
(Gita 2/7). Salvation .can only be attained by discriminating the
self from the body. So long as a man holds ‘I am body’, he
may listen to gospels, may preach gospels to others, may practise
spiritual discipline but salvation is not possible. .
| It is a blunder to accept (assume) a thing, which is not one’s
own, as one’s own and to disown a thing which is one’s own.
Only the thing, which may ever live with us and with which
we may ever live can be our own. The body in the same state
doesn’t stay with us even for a moment while God ever lives
with us. The reason is that the body belongs to the class of the
world, while the self belongs to the class of God. Therefore it is
the greatest blunder to assume the body as one’s own and not to
assume God as one’s own. In order to rectify this blunder, the
Lord in the Gita first of all describes the discrimination between _
the body and the self and awakens the striver to the fact, “You
(self) are not the entity which dies viz., you are not the body. You
are the knower while the body is ‘the known’ (the Gita 13/1).
You are eternal and pervade everywhere ‘nityah sarvagatah’ (Gita :
2/24), ‘yena sarvamidarn tatam’ (Gita 2/17) while the body is
unipresent. You are a resident of the divine world while the body
is a resident of the matter (mortal) world. You are a fragment
of God—‘mamaivamso jivaloke’ (Gita 15/7) while the body |
is a fragment of ‘Prakrti’ (Nature)—-‘manah sasthanindriyani
prakrtisthani’ (Gita 15/7). You ever live in immortality while
the body ever lives in mortality. By the decay and death of
"
135,"92 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 2
the body you don’t decay and die in the least. Therefore, you
shouldn’t be obsessed by grief, worry and fear etc.

The self is not attached and limited to anybody, therefore
it is said to be pervading everywhere—‘sarvagatah’ (Gita 2/24),
‘yena sarvamidarh tatam’ (Gita 2/17). Therefore the true nature of
a striver is merely an ever existent entity, not Sariri (one having
a body) rather it is ‘aSari’ (having no relation with the body).
Therefore the Lord has also designated it as ‘3%™1='—unmanifest
(Gita 2/25), ‘xerorelyart’ unmanifest beings (2/28), the body is
decaying every moment and it is “Asat’. “Asat’ has no existence
‘aradt feed sra:’ (2/16). How a striver having relationship with the
body even whose existence is not there can be termed ‘Sarin?
A striver is neither ‘Sarira’ (body) nor ‘Sariri’ -(dehi). In this
section the Lord has used the term ‘Sariri’ (dehi) for the ever
existent entity in order to explain it to the strivers. By calling it
as ‘Sariri’ He means to say that a striver is not body.

When we reflect upon the nature of the body and the self,
we perceive that the body and the self have their own identity
and when we don’t reflect upon them, then they have also their
own identity. On reflection there is no difference in the reality
of their true nature but by reflecting upon them the striver’s
delusion is destroyed and the human life becomes successful
by attaining its aim.

In human life there is predominance of discrimination.
Therefore “I am not body’—this discrimination is possible only
m the human body. The sense of ‘Il’ and ‘mine’ in the body
is not the work of human intellect but that of beastly intellect.
Therefore Sri Sukadevaji Maharaja says to king Pariksit—

tvam tu rajan marisyeti paSubuddhimim4m  jahi

na jatah pragabhiito’dya dehavattvarh na_ nanksyasi

(Srimadbha. 12/5/2)
"
136,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 93

‘O King! Now give up this beastly intellect that you will die.
As the body was non-existent in the past, it was born afterwards
and will die in future, it is not the case with you (the self) that
you were non-existent in the past, were born afterwards and
will die in future.’

unwise to grieve for what is imperishable.

Comment:—

[There are two things in the world, the soul (the real) and
the body (the unreal) and both of these are not to be grieved
for, because the soul never ceases to be and the body is ever
perishable. So here it is explained that the soul is immortal, while
the body is mortal.] |

kings were also non-existent before our birth. But it is not so.
All of us certainly existed, because the real is always existent,

declaration could suffice. But contrarily it is said—'I, you and
these kings had no such pre-existence—this is not true’. The
reason is, that by the latter expression ‘that there was no such pre-
existence—is not true’, the fact of their pre-existence is emphasized.
"
137,"94 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
It means, that the real is eternal..It was never a naught. By the
term ‘Jatu’, the Lord. means to say that in all tzmes—past, present
and future and in all climes, circumstances, states, incidents and
things etc., this real never ceases to be ever.

Here, by using the word 'Aham' Lord Krsna identifies Himself
with other people, in order to explain that the real never ceases
to be, while in the fifth verse of the fourth chapter Lord Krsna
says, ""You and I have taken many births. I know them all, while
you don't know”, which shows that He as the Lord, is different
from other. In the fifth verse of the fourth chapter, the Lord
expresses His excellence, eminence and glory as compared to
ordinary mortals, while in this verse He expresses His unity,
with the soul of common men.

""Na caiva na bhavisyamah sarve vayamatah param'—In future,
the bodies will not continue to be the same and one day they
will perish, but the (soul) will never cease to be, because the
real is eternal. It was, neither non-existent in the past, nor will
be in, future. |

_ Lord Krsna has talked about the past and the future, by saying
that there was never a time, when they were non-existent, nor
they will cease to be. But, He has not talked about the present,
because they are clearly seen at present through the bodies. In
their present existence, there is no trace of doubt. But if we think
seriously, we come to know that we (the soul) exist at present,
but the bodies are kaleidoscopic. Therefore we should realize
that the soul is different from the bodies, because we have our
existence, at present as we had in the past and we will have, in
future, while the bodies are perishable. |
A man realises his existence, before sleep and after sleep,
but he has his existence during sleep also ever while his body is
undergoing changes every moment, and it will perish one day.
Similarly, the bodies of all of us—I, you and these kings—did
not exist in the past, nor will exist in future and presently also
"
138,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 95
perishing, every moment, but our. self existed in the past, will
exist in future, and exist now.

Our entity is transcendental as we living subject know
time—present, past and future objectively. Subject is always
distinct from object. Thus the Lord has spoken this verse to
explain this transcendental entity of the Self.

Lord Krsna, in this verse says that-the bodies are perishable
while the self is imperishable. It is a rule, that what exists in
the beginning and the end, also exists in the middle, and what
does not exist in the beginning and the end, does not exist in
the middle, either.

But the question arises that how, in the middle these bodies
are visible? The answer is that senses, mind and intellect, with
which we see and worldly objects, which are seen—both are
perishable and change every moment. Man (self) identifies himself,
with the seen. Then, he is called a seer. When the instruments of
perception and the objects of perception, are all perishable and
transient, then how can the apparent onlooker, be permanent? The
apparent entity of a seer (onlooker) is there, because of .affinity
between the seer, the senses and the seen. In case, there is no
such affinity, then this apparent entity of the seer fades away.
But, the base of the apparent entity which is truth, persists. That
truth, is called the base of creation, preservation, destruction
and illuminator of all seeming entities. These names—base and
illuminator are only in relation to objects which they base and
illumine. In the absence of those objects, the truth ever remains,
as it is. He who has an eye for that truth, can never grieve. This
way, ‘I’, ‘you’ and ‘these kings’, are not to be grieved at all.

Appendix—-In this verse there is the description that God
and the self both are endowed with the same characteristics. The
Lord declares, “I as Krsna, you as Arjuna and all these people as
"
139,"96 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
eee EEE DAO eer
kings neither existed in the past nor will exist in future. But all
of us as ever existent entity existed in the past and will also exist
in future. It means that I, you and these kings—these three are
different as far as the bodies are concerned but they are the same
as far as the self is concerned. The bodies neither existed in the
past nor will exist in future but the entity of the soul (self) did
exist in the past, shall exist in future and does exist at present.
When these bodies didn’t exist, the entity of the self was there
and when these bodies will cease to exist, that entity will still ©
remain. There is nothing else except one ever existent entity.
I, you and these kings—by saying so the lord means that the
| entity of God and entity of the embodied self are one and the
same viz., in ‘Is’ and ‘Am’ there is only one pure consciousness.
: It is because of ‘J’ (ego) that ‘am’ is used. If there is no affinity
for ‘I’ (ego), then ‘am’ will not remain but only ‘Is’ will remain.

tatha dehantarapraptirdhirastatra na muhyati

Just as boyhood, youth and old age, changes in this physical
body do not affect the soul likewise is the change to another body.
Wise man never gets disturbed about this. 13
Comment:— |

'Dehino'sminyatha dehe* kaumaram yauvanam jara'—The
body, does not remain the same, but it always changes. It
passes by stages, through babyhood, youth and old age. The
statement 'Dehino'sminyatha dehe’, proves that soul is separate
and the body is separate. The soul is the ‘Seer’, and the body
is the ‘Seen’. Hence the changes of babyhood and youth etc., in
the body, are not in the soul. The soul is changeless.

""Tatha dehantarapraptih'—As, one does not grieve for the body
when it passes through babyhood, youth and old age; similarly
one should not grieve, when the soul passes on, to another body.
As babyhood, youth and old age are different stages of physical
body, so (attaining) another body after death, is a stage, for the
subtle and causal body.

If we perceive in the right perspective, we come to know,
that the body does not pass through babyhood, youth and old
age only, but it changes every moment. Similarly, subtle and
causal bodies, also change, every momentT.

Now, the question arises, that we can perceive our physical
body, but we do not perceive our subtle and causal body and

* The bor one passes through babyhood, youth and old age; but here 'Deha’
has been used for the human body.

T The physical body is left by a man (soul) when he attains another body.
But subtle and causal bodies are not left until he attains salvation. He has affinity
for them so long as he does not attain salvation.
"
141,"98 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
their change. Wakefulness, sleep and sound sleep respectively,
are regarded, as states of physical, subtle and causal bodies. In
sleep, (dream) a baby sees itself as a baby, a youth sees himself
as a youth and an old man sees himself, as an old man. It proves
that a subtle body, also changes. Similarly, in childhood one
gets more soundsleep than in youth, and in old age, it further
decreases. It shows, that there is a change in causal bodies also.
Secondly, a man is more refreshed in his childhood and youth
after sleeping, than he is in his old age. It also proves, the
change in causal bodies.

When one acquires the body of a god, a bird or an animal
etc., (because of identification of the self with the body), one
thinks oneself as the same, it is a change in subtle body. Similarly,
the nature (habit) of a god is different from that of a bird or an
animal. It shows change, in causal body.

A man passes through babyhood, youth and old age and
thus there is a change 1n his body but he experiences, that he is
the same.* It proves, that there is no change, in his 'self' (soul).

Here a doubt comes to our mind, that we experience a
change in the physical body, but we have no knowledge about
our previous bodies, after getting new bodies. The answer is,
that there is so much of pain at the time of death and rebirth,
that one forgets one's previous birth. When a man suffers from
paralysis or old age, his memory becomes weak. Similarly,
by the pangs of death and .birth, one becomes oblivious of
his previous birtht. But, one who dies suddenly, without any
pain, can have a memory of his previous birth.

* In the sacred books this knowledge is called ‘Pratyabhijfia’.

t A man dies by becoming unconscious because of much pain amidst
his lamenting kinsmen (Srimadbha. 3/30/18). At the time of death his breath
stops and memory is lost (Simadbha. 3/31/23).

+ The impression of the previous birth of those who die suddenly and then
are reborn suddenly, continues for sometime but as they grow up, their dream
like old memory is lost (Mahabharata, Anusasana. 145).
"
142,"Verse 13} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 99
When a man rises, after a sound sleep, he says, that he slept
soundly and he was not aware of anything. It means, that he
knows that he was not aware of anything, during sound sleep.
This knowledge of nothingness by the self, proves that the self
existed, even during sound sleep. Thus, his own self existed
before his sleep, during his sleep and also, after his sleep i.e., the
self (soul) exists continuously. None, feels its non-existence at
any time, rather he feels his existence, incessantly. He who feels
himself separate from the body, realizes that he is liberated and
in that liberated state he ever remains so. In that liberated state,
he may not know what bodies he possessed in the past, but his
realization that he is separate from the body, remains intact.
‘Dhirastatra na muhyati'—The wise man (enlightened one),
is he, who can discriminate between the real and unreal. Such a
man, 1s never deluded and he is not reborn, because attachment
for the gunas (qualities, modes), is the cause of birth in good
and evil wombs, and he breaks off his attachment with the
qualities (modes). |
Here 'tatra', has been used, for the difference between the
soul (spirit) and the body, the real and the unreal, the permanent
and the transient. It means, that these are totally different and
one is never deluded about this, because he knows, that he is
different from the body. |
Appendix-——The body never remains uniform while the self
never becomes multiform. The body neither existed before birth
nor will exist after death and at present also it is dying every
moment. In fact the process of its death begins as soon as it
comes to the womb. At the death of boyhood, youth ensues, at
the death of youth, old age ensues and at the death of the old age,
the embodied self passes on to another body. The body undergoes
all these states. Boyhood, youth and old age—these three states
are of the physical body and passing on of the embodied self
to another body is the state of the subtle body and the causal
"
143,"100 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
body. But the entity of pure consciousness transcends all these
states. The states change while the self remains the same. Thus
the enlightened one, who discriminates the distinctiveness of the
body from that of the self, is never deluded.

The embodied soul in order to reap the fruit of its actions
goes to numberless wombs, to hell and heaven. This utterance
proves that eighty-four lac forms of life are left, heaven and hell
are left but the self ever remains the same. Womb (bodies) change __
but the self (Sariri) doesn’t change. The self remains one, so it
goes to several wombs and several worlds. The entity which goes
to several wombs does not get tainted with anyone, doesn’t get
entangled anywhere. If it gets tainted and entangled anywhere,
then who will reap the fruit in eighty-four lac forms of life? Who
will go to heaven and hell? Who will attain salvation?

Birth and death are not our (of the self) traits but are the traits
of the body. Our age viz., age of the self is beginningless and
endless within which several bodies are born and they die. As we
change several clothes but by changing clothes we ourselves don’t
change, we remain the same (Gita 2/22); similarly the entity of
the self even by transmigrating to several bodies ever remains the
same. It means that our freedom and detachment are axiomatic.
Our life doesn’t depend on a particular body. Because of being

_ detached, we even by transmigrating to several bodies, remain
the same, but by assuming our attachment to the body, we have
to take birth in several wombs. The assumed attachment doesn’t
stay but we go on getting attached to other things and persons
etc. If we don’t get attached to them, salvation (detachment) or
independence 1s self-evident or spontaneous.

Link:—Now, Lord Krsna urges us that we should be indifferent
to sorrow and suffering, arising from transitory and perishable
things, like the body etc.

O son of Kunti, bodily sense-objects, which give rise to the
feelings of heat and cold, pleasure and pain efc., are transitory
and fleeting, therefore, Arjuna bear these patiently viz., remain

unaffected by them or ignore them. 14

Comment:—

(Here a doubt arises that in the verses from the eleventh to
the thirteenth and then again from the sixteenth to the thirtieth
there is a context of the spirit and the body, why are then these
two verses about contacts of 'senses with objects’ inserted in |
between? The explanation is that in the twelfth verse as the Lord
placed Himself also in the category of the other people, here He
wants to say that the body is equally transient as other worldly
objects are and therefore these two verses fit in the context.]

'Tu'—'Tu' (indeed), has been used to explain, that transitory
things, such as bodies etc., are different, from the permanent soul.
'‘Matrasparsah'—Senses, including the inner sense, are called

‘Matra’ and 'Sparsah, means ‘Contact’. Therefore, all objects which

are perceived by senses, are called 'Matrasparsah (bodily senses).'

Can affinity with objects, also be included in 'Matrasparsah'? No.

The reason is, that it is not ‘inner sense’, but the ‘self’, which

accepts this affinity and that affinity remains, even when the

objects are lost.* A woman bereaved of her husband fifty years
ago, and if anyone called her as the wife of her husband Mr.

A, she becomes alert, even today. It shows that the assumed
* The affinity with the unreal can perish only if we deny it. Actually the

self has no affinity with the unreal. But it has accepted this affinity. So it can't

be rooted out by any other means such as penances etc. It will be rooted out only
when we cease to accept it.
"
145,"102 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
affinity, has not yet broken off. It means that though objects
are lost, yet the assumed affinity persists.

'Sitosnasukhaduhkhadah'—Here, ‘Sita’ (cold) and 'Usna' (hot),
stand for favourable and unfavourable circumstances. Favourable
circumstances, give us pleasure while unfavourable ones give
pain. If the terms ‘Sita’ and 'Usna mean cold and heat, then
these will represent only objects of touch and their meanings
will be limited. These will not represent all sense-objects, and
circumstances. Therefore, it is proper to take their meanings,
as ‘favourable’ and ‘unfavourable’ circumstances. The fact is,
that the favourable (desirable) or unfavourable (undesirable)

. circumstances and things cannot give pleasure or pain, but it is
the affinity with them, which is the cause of pleasure and pain.
So the Lord has called the objects 'Sukhaduhkhadah' (producers.
of pleasure and pain). | :

‘Agamapayinah'—All objects, have a beginning and an end,
they are born and disappear. So they are 'Agamapay7, i.e., they
appear and disappear.

‘Anityah'—It may be said, that objects may not have pre-
existence or post-existence, but in between, they do exist. The
Lord declares, that as they are 'Anitya’ (transient) they do not
exist even, in the interim. They change, every moment. They
change, so swiftly, that no one can see them, again in the same
form, because they do not maintain the same shape, the next
moment. Therefore, the Lord has called all objects, as 'anitya.'

It means, that all worldly objects are transitory and fleeting, .
and they change every moment. Not only objects, but the senses,
including the inner sense with which we perceive objects, are
also transitory. There is always a change, in them. For example,
the senses get tired by the evening, while working throughout a
day and get refreshed in the morning, after a night's sleep.

Here, all objects in a gross sense are called 'agamapayinah'
(appearing and disappearing). In a finer sense, these are called,
"
146,"_—_—
Verse 14] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 103
‘anityah’ (changing every moment). In a more fine way, they
will be described in the sixteenth verse of this chapter, as ‘asat’
(non-existent), while the soul described earlier, as eternal will be
called as 'sat', (ever-existent), in the sixteenth verse of this chapter.
Mere knowledge, of agreeable and disagreeable senses
is not at all defective. But attachment with and aversion to
them or pleasure and pain, in relation to them is a fault. Not
to be affected by such an evil, is expressed by the expression
‘tarhstitiksasva’. |
Secondly, the body and senses and their actions, have a
beginning and an end, while you as a spectator, are different from
them. They always change, but you never change. Therefore, you
: should remain unaffected by them i.e., you should ignore them.
To remain unaffected (untainted) is called here, 'titiksa’. :
| Appendix—aAs the body never remains uniform but changes
every moment, similarly all the worldly objects (Prakrti viz.,
Nature and its evolutes) which are perceived by senses-mind-
o intellect, never remain uniform, they undergo union and disunion.
| We feel happy with the union of those objects which we like and
7 their disunion makes us sad. We feel happy with the disunion of
5 those objects which we don’t like and their union makes us sad.
e Objects are also fleeting and transient. Similarly the senses and
E the inner faculty are also fleeting and transient and the pleasure
E or pain caused by the union or disunion of these objects is also
a fleeting and transient. But the self ever remains the same, it is
. immutable and eternal. Therefore one should bear them (pleasure
. and pain) patiently viz., one shouldn’t feel happy and sad by their
"" union and disunion but remain unaffected by them. Pleasure and
P pain—both are different but their seer is one and he is separate
- _ (unaffected) from both of them. By seeing the changeable, the
a immutability of the self (soul) is naturally perceived as the
aq unchangeable only can see the changeable.
4 oo Hence the term ‘Sita’ stands for favourableness while
q ‘usna’ stands for unfavourableness. It means that when it is
"
147,"104 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
very much cold, a tree dries up and when it is very hot, then
also a tree dries up; therefore the result of both ‘hot’ and ‘cold’
is only one. Therefore the Lord orders to bear them viz., to rise
above them. |
Pleasure-pain, joy-grief, attachment-aversion, desire-anger etc.,

are fleeting and kaleidoscopic while the self (soul) remains the
same. A seeker commits a blunder that he sees the changing
condition but doesn’t perceive the self. He accepts the condition
but doesn’t accept the self. The condition neither existed in the
past nor will exist in future; therefore it doesn’t exist at present
also though it appears to exist. But in the self there is neither
beginning nor end nor middle at all. A condition never remains
uniform and the self never becomes multiform. Whatever is
seen is a ‘condition’ and the intellect which sees it is alsoa ©
‘condition’. The thing which is to be known is a ‘condition’
and the thing which knows it is also a ‘condition’. In the self
there is neither anything to be seen nor there 1s one who sees it;
there 1s nothing to be known nor one who knows it. The object
to be seen and he who sees it etc., are subject to conditions.
The object to be seen and the seer who sees it—will not remain
but the self will remain, because the condition will perish but
the self will remain. It means that by having connection with
the object to be seen (scene), the self becomes the spectator.
If it has no connection with the object to be seen, the self will
remain but it will not be named as the spectator. In the same
way the self (pure consciousness) by having affinity for ‘Sarira’
(body) is called ‘Sariri’. If it has no relationship with the body,
the self will remain but it will not be named ‘Sarin’ (Git 13/1).
Therefore the Lord has used the term ‘Sarin’ for the self or pure
consciousness in order to merely explain it to human beings.

| Link:—In the next verse, Lord Krsna talks of the result of
remaining unaffected with objects.

O the best of men, a person to whom pain and pleasure are

Comment:— |
- 'Purusarsabha'—Men, generally try to change inevitable
circumstances. But, Arjuna instead of trying to change these,

| has thought of attaining benediction, which shows, that he is
the best of men. |

‘Samaduhkhasukham dhiram'—A resolute person remains
alike in pleasure and pain. He experiences pleasure and pain,
only when he is attached to three gunas (qualities, modes) born
of matter (nature) (Gita 13/20-21). But when he gets immersed
in the self, he does not experience pleasure and pain, and
becomes unruffled. :

'Yarn hi na vyathayantyete purusam'—To a man of steady
wisdom, the sense-objects do not give pain. Pleasure, ensuing
from the contact of sense-objects, is perturbing (Vyatha). Similarly,
pain arising from their separation is also disconcerting. .He
who has an eye for equanimity cannot be happy or sad. by
these objects. Such a person knows what are favourable and
unfavourable circumstances, but he remains unaffected by them.
They do not leave any impression, on his mind.

'‘So'mrtatvaya. kalpate'—Such a man of steady wisdom,
becomes eligible for immortality viz., he acquires the
capability of realizing immortality. Being capable, he realizes
immortality instantly, because his immortality is axiomatic. It
was only because of ones affinity with objects (body etc.,) that
it was obscure.
"
149,"106 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2

This human life, has not been bestowed upon man to experience
pleasure and pain, but to attain the supreme bliss having obtained
which, he has nothing else to seek (Gita 6/22). If we remain
greedy and desirous of acquiring favourable circumstances, we
shall not be able to make use of those circumstances, because our
energy will be wasted in the enjoyment of those circumstances,
rather than in making proper use of these. Similarly, if we grieve
over unfavourable circumstances or in their possibility, we will
not be able to make use of them, rather we will be brooding
over these. To get pleased over favourable circumstances is
their enjoyment. The use of favourable circumstances, for mere
maintenance of a body, and for the welfare of poverty-stricken
people, is their proper use. Thus, riches in the form of favourable
circumstances, should be considered, as property of the poor.
We should neither be pleased with desirable circumstances, nor
displeased with undesirable ones, but we should make the best
possible use of these. Otherwise, we shall have to suffer pain.

It is a proper use of desirable circumstances, if having
satisfied our needs, we use these to serve the needy and the
destitute, instead of enjoying these ourselves. Actually, our riches
are for the needy and the poor. So we should utilize these for
their welfare. These are, the poor and the destitute, who have
enabled the rich to be proud of, their mches. Had all others been
multimillionaires could these millionaires have had pleasure and
pride out of their being millionaires? No. The poor and destitute
people, are the cause, of their pleasure and pride. Therefore, the
rich people should serve the desolate and the destitute, as it is
their duty to do so. But if they don't do so and enjoy the riches
themselves they only are thankless. |

Now, the question arises, how to make use of undesirable
circumstances. The answer is that undesirable circumstances
are painful, when there is desire for pleasure. If that desire 1s
"
150,"Verse 15] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 107
renounced, then undesirable circumstances cannot be painful. If
a patient is given bitter medicines and painful injections, he
is not upset, rather he is pleased, because he knows that bitter
medicines and painful injections, are cures for his disease. Thus,
it is the proper use of undesirable circumstances, to bear pain,
without having any grudge, against it. If one gets displeased with
bitter medicines etc., then that is brooding over unfavourable
circumstances. It will result in great misery. |

If we enjoy pleasure and are tormented by pain, we may
get heaven or hell but cannot be eligible for salvation, because
salvation, is attained by those, who remain alike in pleasure and pain.

: The Lord, in the fourteenth verse, has said that objects give
rise to feelings of pleasure and pain, but these are transitory and
fleeting. The moment we acquire them, their decay and parting
starts. These were neither with us in the past, nor will remain
in future and present, also they are going to be naught. But by
enjoying these we are spoiling our nature, and are depriving
ourselves of attainment of salvation. Therefore, if we make proper
use of the available circumstances, we shall rise above pleasure
and pain, and attain a state of the highest bliss.

Appendix—the self is in the form of an entity. In that entity
there is no perturbation. When the self identifies itself with the
body, then perturbation ensues. Therefore a person who assumes
himself to be seated in the body can’t be free from torment. Freedom
from torment means—not to rejoice on obtaining what is pleasant
and not to grieve on receiving what is unpleasant (Gita 5/20).
By being free from torment a man’s intellect (understanding)
becomes firm—‘sthirbuddhirasammudhah’ (Gita 5/20).

To rejoice and to grieve in favourable and unfavourable
circumstances means to be tormented. To rejoice and to grieve
is ‘bhoga’ of pleasure and pain. The seeker of pleasure and
sufferer in pain can never be happy. A striver should not rejoice
and grieve in favourable and unfavourable circumstances but
"
151,"108 | SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA (Chapter 2
should utilize these circumstances. The favourable and the
unfavourable circumstances are determined by fate; and to utilize
those circumstances by regarding them as material for spiritual
progress, is the real valour. This valour results in immortality.
Utilization of favourable circumstances is to provide happiness
to others and to render service to them; while the utilization of
unfavourable circumstances is to renounce the desire for pleasure
or favourable circumstances. By utilizing the unfavourable
circumstances a striver discovers the reason for pain. The
reason for pain is the desire for pleasure—‘ye hi sarnsparsaja
bhoga duhkhayonaya eva te’ (Gita 5/22). The person (bhogt)
who enjoys pleasure and suffers pain has a downfall while he
(yogi) who utilizes pleasure and pain, by rising above pleasure
and pain, attains immortality.

time-fire consumes the world, in such a way that no remains,
are left. There is total annihilation of the world. Therefore, it
has been said, that the unreal has no existence.

'Nabhavo vidyate satah'—The real never ceases to be. The
Atma (spirit or soul) remains constant. It existed, before the birth
of the body, exists now, when the body is undergoing change |
and will exist, after the death of the body. Similarly, God also
ever remains the same, while the world undergoes a change,
every moment. : oe

The world is kaleidoscopic, it changes every moment. So it
cannot be seen in the same state, the very next moment. Bodies
are taking birth, and dying every moment, but the process is not
perceived, with these dull physical eyes.* Similarly, the. world
is also perishing, all the time. But it is not perceived, because
the senses, mind and intellect etc., also belong to the same
class, to which the world belongs. So, how can the perishable
perceive, the perishable? Only the imperishable (self), (spirit)
can perceive it.

Secondly the self cannot perform any activity, without
assistance of the world (body, senses, mind and intellect). It
proves, that all activities take place in the world rather than,
in the self. The self has no affinity with activities, and objects.
It proves, that the world, with body, mind, senses and intellect
etc., is non-existent. Only the super soul (God), is ever existent,
who ever remains untainted and is the basis and illuminator, of
the entire world.

'Ubhayorapi drsto'ntastvanayostattvadarsibhih'—Seers of truth,
have perceived the truth, about the reali, and the unreal, or the

* Though there is a continuous process of birth and death of bodies, yet the
process is not perceived because of the subtle speed of time.
"
153,"1100 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
soul and the body. The fact is, that the real is ever-existent, the
unreal has no existence, but it seems to exist because of the light

of the real. Therefore.the essence of the real (Sat), and the unreal
(asat) 1s ‘sat’, (ever-existent). The real has been called as ‘Para
Prakrti’ (higher or sentient nature) (Gita 7/5), 'Ksetrajna (self,
soul) (Gita 13/1-2), ‘Purusa’ (spirit) (Gita 13/19) and ‘aksara' (the
imperishable) (Gita 15/16), while the unreal has been called 'apara
prakrti’ (lower or insentient nature), Ksetra (non-self), prakrti
(matter) and 'Ksara' (the perishable).

Arjuna is grieved by thinking, that the warriors will die. So, the
Lord explains that the real never dies, and the unreal never exists
as it is continuously dying. Therefore, it is not wise, to grieve.

In the eleventh verse, it has been said, that 'pandita’ (the
wise) grieve neither for the living, nor for the dead. In the twelfth
and thirteenth verses the word ‘dhira’ (wise or enlightened) has
been used for the person, who: realizes the distinction, between
the soul and the body; in the fifteenth verse also ‘dhira’, has
been used for a person who does not grieve over, the decay
of the body and the world, In the sixteenth verse ‘tattvadarsi'
(the seers of truth), has. been used for a discerning person, who
distinguishes between the real and unreal. All these words dhira
etc., show that the wise do not grieve and if they grieve, it
means, that they are not wise. |

Appendix—The ever-existent entity (self) 1s real and except
that entity whatever Prakrti (Nature) and its evolutes (actions
and objects) are, they are all unreal and kaleidoscopic. Those
great souls who have perceived the truth about both the real
and the unreal viz., those, who have realized the self, hold that
the unreal has no existence and the real never ceases to be viz.,
there is nothing except that entity (the real).

The Lord in the fourteenth and fifteenth verses described the
transitory nature of the body; here the same has been described
by the expression—‘nasato vidyate bhavah’ (the unreal has no
"
154,"Verse 16] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI Wy
existence); and in the twelfth and thirteenth verses the eternal
nature of the ‘Sariri’ (self) was described, that has been mentioned
here by the expression—‘nabhavo vidyate satah’ (the real never
ceases to be).

‘Nasato vidyate bhavo nabhavo vidyate satah’—In these
sixteen letters there is the gist of all the Vedas, Puranas and
scriptures. ‘Asat’ and ‘Sat’—these two have been called by
several names such as ‘Prakrti’ (Nature) and ‘Purusa’ (self),
‘Ksara’ (perishable) and ‘Aksara’ (imperishable), ‘Sarira’
(body) and ‘Sariri’ (self), transitory and eternal, perishable and
imperishable etc. Whatever is seen, heard, understood, thought

| of and determined etc., is ‘unreal’ and the organs of senses, by
which the actions of seeing, hearing and thinking etc., are done,
are also ‘unreal’ and whatever seen is also ‘unreal’.

In the half verse (sixteen letters) three roots have been used—

(1) ‘bhii sattayam’—as ‘abhavah’ and ‘bhavah’ |

(2) ‘as’bhuvi’—as ‘asatah’ and ‘satah’ |

(3) ‘vid sattayam’—as ‘vidyate’ and ‘na vidyate’

Although these three roots mean only an ‘entity’ yet in their
subtle: form they have also their independent meanings—as the
meaning of ‘bhu’ root is ‘utpatti’ (origin), the meaning of ‘as’
root is ‘satta’ (entity) existence and the meaning of ‘vid’ root
is ‘vidyamanata’ (existence of the present).

The meaning of the expression ‘nasato vidyate bhavah’ means
‘asatah bhavah na vidyate’ viz., the unreal has no existence or
the unreal is non-existent because it is continuously perishing _
(changing). The unreal is not present. The unreal is not acquired.
The unreal is not constant. The thing which is born, certainly
dies—this is the rule. As soon as it is born, it starts perishing
at once. It perishes so quickly that no one can see it two times

| viz., having seen it once, it can’t be seen in the same condition
the second time. This is the principle that the thing which has
no existence at any time is always non-existent. Therefore the
"
155,"112 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
world is always non-existent. However existence we may give
to the world, however importance (value) we may attach to it,
but it doesn’t exist at all. The unreal is neither acquired, nor
was acquired nor will ever be acquired. It is not possible to
acquire the unreal.

- ‘Nabhavo vidyate satah’—This expression means—‘satah
abhavah na vidyate’ viz., the real never ceases to be rather the
real is existent, it is never non-existent (changeable). The entity
which ceases to be is not called the real. The entity of the real is
ever-existent. The real is ever present. The real is ever attained.
The real 1s ever constant. |

| The real never ceases to be in any place, thing, person,
action, incident, circumstance, state and time etc. The reason Is
that the place, time and thing etc., are unreal (kaleidoscopic) but
| the real ever exists the same, in it there is never any change,
jt never ceases to be. Therefore the real is ever-existent. To
whatever extent we may deny the existence of the Supreme
Soul, to whatever extent we may neglect Him, to whatever
extent we may have disinclination for Him, to whatever extent
we may disregard Him, to whatever extent we may contradict
His existence by giving arguments but He never ceases to be.
The non-existence of the real is not possible. No one can destroy
the imperishable entity (Gita 2/17).

‘ubhayorapi drstah’—Seers of truth have not created
(produced) the real entity but they have seen it viz., perceived
the truth about it. Jt means that non-existence of the unreal
and existence of the real—the truth of both of these have been

| perceived by the liberated enlightened souls who perceive only
the real entity viz., realize the self-evident ‘Is’. The base of the
unreal is also real and the truth about the real is also real—by
knowing this, in the view of the exalted souls no other entity
except. the real entity ‘Is’ remains.

The non-existence of the unreal and the existence of the
"
156,"Verse 17] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 113
real prove that only the real exists. In that real entity there is
no such duality as ‘deha’ (body) and ‘deh?’ (self).

So long as the unreal’s existence is assumed, there is
discrimination. But when the unreal ceases to exist, then
discrimination changes into Self-realization. ‘Ubhayorapi drsto’-
ntastvanayostattvadarsibhih’—in this expression in ‘Ubhayorapi’
there is discrimination; in ‘antah’ there is Self-realization and
in ‘drstah’ there is perception of the real viz., discrimination
changed into Self-realization and only the entity remained. There
is nothing except that entity—this is the most important fact of
the Discipline of Knowledge. |

| The unreal has no existence—this is true and the real never
ceases to be—this is also true. It is the duty of a striver to accept
this truth. A striver may have this realization or not, he has to
accept this fact. One has to accept the entity ‘Is’ and to deny
‘No’—this is Vedanta, this is the main gist of the Vedas.

In the world in spite of the appearance of both—existence
and non-existence there is predominance of ‘non-existence’.
In God also both of them appear, but there is predominance
of ‘existence.’ In the world within ‘non-existence’ there are
existence and non-existence and in God within ‘existence’ there
are existence and non-existence. In other words in the world
within ‘eternal disunion’ there are union and disunion while in
God within ‘eternal union’ there are union and disunion (meeting-
separation). Therefore in the world only non-existence persists
while in God only existence persists.

real and the unreal.

| avinasi tu tadviddhi yena sarvamidam tatam
vinasSamavyayasyasya na kaScitkartumarhati

Know that to be imperishable, by which all this world
is pervaded; for none can bring about the destruction, of the
indestructible. 17
Comment:— |

‘Avinasi tu tadviddhi'—Here 'tu' (indeed), has been used to
explain ‘Sat’ the real out the two 'sat' (real) and '‘asat' (unreal),
described in the preceding verse.

The Lord advises Arjuna, to realise that imperishable entity.
He explains that this entity is abstract. By calling it abstract,

: (paroksa), the Lord means to say, that this abstract imperishable
entity, is pervading the whole world, which appears as separate,
from that entity. In reality, only this all-pervading entity exists,
while the world which appears to exist, does not exist really.

By the term '‘tat' (that), it is not meant to say that ‘sat tattva'
(the real), stands afar, but it means, that it is not a subject of
senses and inner sense.

""Yena sarvamidarh tatam'*—The abstract-entity is described
here. This whole world, is pervaded by that imperishable entity.
As ornaments made of gold have nothing but gold, weapons
made of iron, have nothing but iron, pots of clay have nothing
but clay, and in ice, there is nothing but water, similarly, this
world is pervaded by ‘sat’ (real) (imperishable). So, in the world,
there is nothing to be realised except the real.

""Vinasamavyayasyasya na kaSscitkartumarhati'—The spirit

* Yena sarvamidam tatam’ has been used in the Gita three times. Here it
has been used for the imperishable by which the whole world is pervaded. It is
described with the view of 'Sankhyayoga' (the Discipline of Knowledge). In the
twenty-second verse of the eighth chapter it has been used for God (Supreme
Purusa) Who can be attained by exclusive devotion. Again in the forty-sixth verse
of the eighteenth chapter there is the description, ‘By whom all this 1s pervaded’
which also is with the point of view of devotion.
"
158,"Verse 17] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 115
(Soul), is imperishable,* while the body is perishable, and
is perishing every moment. No one, can check its process of
destruction. But whether you wage war or withdraw from it, the
imperishable cannot be destroyed and the perishable cannot be saved.

Here the word ‘asya’ means, that whatever reality appears
in the kaleidoscopic body, is because of real entity (self), and
that self (spirit), is different from the body. — :

Appendix—lIn practical life we say, “This is a man, this is an
animal, this is a tree, this is a house’ etc. In these expressions
‘man, animal, tree, house’ etc., neither existed in the past nor
will exist in future and at present also they are perishing every
moment. But in them the eternal reality ‘Is’ ever remains the
same. It means that ‘man, animal, tree, house’ etc., are the world
(unreal) and ‘Is’ is the imperishable Self (the real). ‘Therefore
‘man, animal, tree, house’ etc., are different but in all of them
‘Is’ (Eternal reality) remains the same. Similarly in ‘I am a man,
I am an animal, I am a god’ etc., bodies are different but ‘am’
or ‘is’ remains the same.

‘Yena sarvamidam tatam’—This expression here has been
used for the embodied soul while in the twenty-second verse of
the eighth chapter and. in the forty-sixth verse of the eighteenth
chapter, this expression has been used for God. It means that
the self has the same charactenistics as all-pervading God has.
Therefore as God is detached from the world, so is the self
naturally detached from the body and the world—‘asango hyayam
purusah’ (Brhada. 4/3/15), “dehe’sminpurusah parah’ (Gita 13/22).
The self is not seated in a particular body. It is not attached to
any body. But without realizing this detachment, it is following |
the cycle of birth and death. |

PIOSTSESE me

* In the Gita the Lord has called the spirit as well as Himself imperishable.
But the difference is that the Lord incarnates and conceals Himself by His free-
will while the spirit seated in Matter takes birth and dies because it identifies
itself with the body.

These bodies acquired by the imperishable, indefinable and
eternal soul, are spoken of, as perishable. Therefore, OQ Arjuna,
fight. 18
Comment:—

'Anadsinah’'—A thing, which never changes, never decays
and never gets extinct, in the least, by any cause, under any
circumstances, 1s called ‘anas1'. The soul (spirit), is not exposed to,
destruction or change. So, it is indestructible or imperishable.

'Aprameyasya'—The soul, is beyond the domain of senses,
speech and mind, so it is indefinable. It can be experienced, only
by having faith in scriptures, and saints and their gospels.

The scriptures and saints, do not compel anyone to have faith
im them. One, is free to have such faith or not to have it. In case
one reposes faith in them, that ‘tattva’ (reality), is the object of
his faith, otherwise it is not the object of, his faith.

'Nityasya'——-The soul, does not undergo any change, it never
ceases to be, it exists all the time.

'Antavanta ime deha uktah Saririnah'—-These bodies, of
imperishable, indefinable and eternal soul, are spoken of as
perishable i.e., they have an end. It means that these are perishing,
every moment. They are nothing but, a mass of decay.

In the above sentence, a singular number, has been used
for the soul, while plural for the bodies. Firstly it is so because
the bodies of every embodied soul are of three kinds—physical,
subtle and causal and secondly because a single soul, pervades
all worldly bodies. Further in the twenty-fourth verse, the Lord
calls it all-pervading viz., omnipresent. It means, that all the
bodies are perishable, while soul is imperishable.

*T
"
160,"Verse 18] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 117
All the bodies which, are perceptible, are perishable, while
the soul is imperishable and eternal. But this immortal soul,
though different from body, identifies itself with the body and
develops ‘an ego’ or 'I'ness with it, and thus regards its death, as
self's (soul's) death. He who identifies himself, with wealth and
learning etc., calls himself as wealthy and learned etc. Similarly,
when one accepts a body, as one's own, one develops the feeling
of attachment or mineness for it, and this attachment, extends
to wealth and family etc., because he accepts these as his own,
by having affinity with these. By this affinity of ‘T'ness and
'Mineness'’, all evils are born, one cannot discriminate, between
the real and the unreal, and is thus grieved, while the wise are
not grieved, because they realize that the real cannot perish and
the unreal cannot exist. _

'Tasmat* yudhyasva'—Lord Krsna directs Arjuna, to fight |
i.e., discharge his duty, by discriminating between the real and
unreal. He means to say, that he should not grieve but wage war,
because the soul is imperishable, while bodies are perishable.

In the seventeenth and eighteenth verses, there is a notable
explanation of the real and the unreal, because the Lord wants
Arjuna, to realize the real. By realizing the essence, one gets rid
of the unreal, spontaneously. Thus by realizing this fact, he would
discharge his duty. It shows, that every human being, without any
distinction of caste, creed, colour or stage of life, can freely follow
either the Discipline of Action, or Discipline of Knowledge, for —
his salvation. But, in practical life, a duty should be discharged, |

* Here the word ""Tasmat', has been used for drawing a conclusion after
reasoning. In the Gita ‘Tasmat' has been used either for drawing the conclusion
after reasoning or at the end of a context. In 2/30, 3/19, 8/7 and 8/27 verses it has
been used at the end of a context while in 2/25, 2/27, 2/37, 2/68, and 11/33 it has
been used to conclude reasoning. |
"
161,"| 118 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter2
, according to one's varna (caste) and asrama (stage of life), by
oe following the ordinance of scriptures. Therefore, here while
discussing the real and the unreal according to the discipline of
| knowledge Lord Krsna, orders Arjuna to fight or in other words he
: advises Arjuna to discharge his duty even if he follows discipline

of knowledge. |
| Further, in the thirteenth chapter, where there is a description
of virtues of knowledge Lord Krsna in 13/9, also lays emphasis
| on non-attachment, and non-identification of the self, with a son,
wife, home etc. If only hermits, had deserved the Discipline of
knowledge (Sankhyayoga), the Lord would not have mentioned,
the need for non-attachment and non-identification of the self,
with a son, wife, home etc., because hermits, have no sons,

wives and homes etc. _

Thus, by meditating on the Gita, both the Disciplines of
Knowledge, as well as Action (Karma), have proved to be
independent means, for God-realization for all human beings,
without distinction of any varna or stage of life. |

Appendix—The Lord at the outset of His gospel explained
that both ‘gatastin’ (dead) and ‘agatastn’ (living) are not to be
grieved for. Then in the twelfth and thirteenth verses in order

. to explain that ‘gatasuin’ is not to be grieved, He explained the
real (the eternal) and in the fourteenth and fifteenth verses in
order to explain that ‘agatasun’ 1s not to be grieved, He described
the unreal (the transitory).. Then He explained both ‘Sat’ (the
real) and ‘Asat’ (the unreal) in the sixteenth verse. After that
by discussing the existence of the real and non-existence of the
unreal specially in the seventeenth and eighteenth verses, He

. completes this sub-topic.

Though there is existence only of the soul, not of the body,
yet a man commits an error that he first sees the body and then
perceives the soul in it; first sees the form (appearance), then

perceives the existence. How long will this outward polish stay?
"
162,"Verse 19] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 119
A striver should reflect upon whether the soul (self) existed first
or the body existed first. On reflection it is proved that first there
is the self and then there is the body, the existence is first and
the appearance is afterwards. Therefore a striver first should
perceive the self as existent, not the body.

Link:— Upto the previous verse, there is description of seers
who know the soul, as imperishable. In the next verse, Lord
Krsna to emphasize the same fact, speaks of those, who do not
regard the soul as indestructible, by a negative inference.

Both of them are ignorant, one who holds the soul as, the
slayer and the other who considers it, as slain; for the soul, neither
slays, nor is slain. 19
Comment:— ae

""Ya enam vetti hantaram'— One who considers the soul as
slayer is ignorant because the soul does not act. But by identifying -
with the body, it accepts itself as a doer. As an artisan, however |
clever he may be, cannot work without tools, similarly, the soul |
without body cannot do anything. Therefore, the Lord, in the :
thirteenth chapter, declares, that he who sees that all actions are
performed by prakrti (nature) alone, realizes the self, as non-doer
(13/29). It means, that the self is not a doer. But, by identifying
Itself with body it assumes Itself to be the doer of actions,
performed by the body. If a man, does not identify himself with
the body, he is not at all, a doer, of any activity.

'YaScainam manyate hatam'—One who holds the soul as
slain, is also ignorant. As the soul is never the slayer, so it is
"
163,"120 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
never killed, because the soul, always remains unaffected and
unchanged. Only the perishable and changeable, can be slain.
How could the imperishable and unchangeable, be slain?
'Ubhau tau na vijanito nayarn hanti na hanyate'—~Both of these,
who holds the soul as slayer, and he, who considers it as slain,
are ignorant. A question arises, whether he, who holds the soul
_as slayer, as well as slain, is not ignorant. The answer is, that
he is also ignorant, because the soul is neither a destroyer, nor
can it be destroyed. It is always the same, without any change.
Therefore, one should not grieve. |
The soul, has been described, neither as a slayer nor as slain,
| because it was in the context of war, before Arjuna. But, actually
the soul, is free from all acitons and modifications. 7
Appendix—This Sariri (the possessor of the body) neither
slays anyone nor is slain by anyone—it means that it is neither
a doer of an action nor is an object of action nor is affected
in anyway. Those, who, like the body, hold the Sariri as the
slayer and as the slain, indeed don’t attach importance to the
discrimination between the body and the self but attach importance
| to indiscrimination.

body, is slain. 20

Comment:— |

[The body constituted of elements, undergoes six kinds of
modifications—to be born, to exist, to change, to grow, to decay
and to perish. But, the soul remains unaffected by, these changes.
The Lord explains this fact, in this verse.]

'Na jayate mriyate va kadacinna'—The soul, unlike a body
is never born, it is eternal. So the Lord in 15/7, has declared,

| ‘This soul in the body, is an eternal portion of Myself.’

The soul never dies. Only that, which is born, dies. The
soul remains unaffected by all kinds of changes. Of all these
changes, birth and death, are the most important ones. Therefore,
the Lord has used 'Na jayate’ and 'Ajah', for the unborn and
also ‘Na mriyate, and 'Na hanyate hanyamane Sarire, for the
unslain, twice.

‘Ayam bhitva bhavita va na bhiyah'—This imperishable
element, does not exist, on coming into being, unlike a
child, that exists after bith and has a beginning and an end,
it is free from different kinds of changes and is without
beginning and end.

'Ajah'—This soul is never born, so it is called ‘Ajah' viz., unborn.

'Nityah'—The soul is eternal. It does never decay in the least
while the bodies and senses decay and lose their strength.

'§avatah'—The soul is constant and changeless.

'Puranah'—It is ancient and primeval. Generally a thing
which becomes old does not grow, it rather perishes. But the
soul neither grows nor perishes.

'Na hanyate hanyamane Sarire'—The soul is not slain even
when the body is slain. Lord Krsna means to say that the body
"
165,"122 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
undergoes six modifications because it is perishable while the
soul is imperishable.

Here in these verses Lord Krsna has made such a distinction
between the body and the soul, as is rarely found anywhere else
in the Gita.

Arjuna was grieved after thinking about the death of his
kinsmen in the war. So Lord Krsna wants to explain to him
that the soul is not killed even when the body is slain, so he
should not grieve. |

Appendix—Our (of the self) nature and the nature of the body
are quite different. We (the self) are not attached to the body,
are not mingled with the body. The body is not attached to us, it

| is not mixed with us. Therefore at the death of the body we are
not affected at all. By now we have passed through innumerable
bodies, but what difference did it make in our entity (existence)?
What loss did we sustain? We remained the same—‘bhutagramah
sa evayam bhitva bhutva praliyate’ (Gita 8/19). Similarly at the
death of the body we’ll remain the same.

As hands, feet and nose etc., are organs of the body, likewise
the body is not an organ of the self. That which flows and varies
is not an organ* (of the imperishable) as phlegm and _ urine
etc., flow and an ulcer (boil) varies, so they are not organs of
the body. Similarly the body which flows and varies is not an
organ of the self.

Link:—In the nineteenth verse, Lord Krsna told Arjuna
that soul neither slays, nor is Slain. In the twentieth verse, He
explained how it is not slain. Now, in the next verse, He explains
how it does not slay. 7 |

O Partha, How can, a man who realises this soul to be |

Comment:— |
'VedavinaSinam nityam ya enamajamavyayam katham sa 7
purusah partha karh ghatayati hanti kam'—The man, who realizes |
this soul to be imperishable, eternal and free from birth and
decay, can have no inclination to slay, anyone or cause anyone, |
to be slain. He is free from egoism i.e., he has no feeling of an
agent in him, and so actions do not taint him.
' Here, Lord Krsna has explained that the soul 1s free from |
six kinds of modifications (i.e.) to be born, to exist, by the term
‘Aja’, to change, to grow by the term ‘nitya’, to decay by the
term ""avyayam’' and to perish by the term ‘avinasr, |
Now, a question arises, If the Lord by the terms 'na hanyate
hanyamane Sarire’ and 'kam ghatayati hanti kam' had merely to 7
tell Arjuna that the soul is neither a doer nor an object of action 7
then why he used words ‘not a slayer’ or ‘not a slain’ for the soul. -
The answer is that the theme is of a war, so it is necessary to 7
say so. But He means, that the soul, is neither the agent (doer), :
nor the object of action. Therefore, one while discharging duty, |
should not grieve, while slaying anyone or causing anyone to
be slain, but should discharge one's duty, in accordance with the

Appendix—A thing which is produced (born) certainly perishes,
it has not to be perished (destroyed). But the thing which is not
born, never perishes. We passed through eighty four lac forms of
bodies but no body stayed with us and we didn’t stay with any
body; but we remained the same and apart. Those bodies didn’t
possess this power of discrimination but only this human body
has been endowed with it. If we don’t realize it, we disregard
the discrimination bestowed upon us by God.

As a person discarding worn-out clothes, puts on new ones,

which are new. 22

| Comment:—

_ 'Vasamsi jirnani yatha vihaya navani grhnati naro'parani
tatha Sarirani vihadya jirnanyanyani samyati navani dehi'—In the
thirteenth verse of this chapter, it has been mentioned in brief that
a wiseman does not get deluded, when the soul, transmigrates from
one body to another. Now, Lord Krsna by giving an illustration
explains, that as a man by casting off old clothes is not grieved,

| so a man casting off worn-out bodies, should not grieve.

Here the word nara’ (man), has been used for a human being,
including men-women, boys-girls, young-old etc., all.

As a man discarding old clothes, puts on new ones, so
does an embodied soul, casting off worn-out bodies, enter into
new bodies. The casting off, of worn-out bodies is called death,
while its acquiring new bodies, is called birth. So long as, this
embodied soul has connection with prakrti, it goes on acquiring
néw bodies, according to actions of the past, or according to
thoughts. at the moment of death.

Here the term 'Sarirani’ (bodies), has been used in plural
"
168,"Verse 22] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 125
form. It means, that so long as an embodied soul, does not get
emancipated, it goes on acquiring new bodies, upto eternity. The
bodies, it has acquired are countless. The term ‘dehi’ has been
used, to indicate, all embodied souls. |

In the first half of this verse, there is mention of discarding
of worn-out clothes, while in the second half, there is reference
to casting off worn-out bodies.* So, how can the illustration of
old clothes befit bodies, when bodies of even children and young
men, die? The answer is, that end of age, means the worn-out
bodies, whether they are of children, youngmen or old men.

In this verse, the Lord by using the terms, 'yatha' (as) and
'‘tatha' (so), has explained that as a man, discarding worn-out
clothes, puts on new ones, so does an embodied soul, casting
off worn-out bodies, acquire other bodies, which are new.

Here, a doubt arises, that a man is free in casting off old
clothes and putting on new ones, but he is not free to cast off
an old body and enter into a new one. The answer is, that Lord
Krsna does not mean to talk about freedom and dependence. His

aim is to dispel the grief, arising from the separation of a body.
One should not grieve, over the death of a body, because the
soul remains unattached and unchanged. From this angle, this
example is appropriate.

Another question that arises is, that a man is happy by
discarding old clothes and putting on new ones, whereas he
feels grieved, while casting off an old body and getting into
a new one. The reason is, that a man by identifying himself
with a body, wants to live long and thinks of the death of the
body, as his own death. Thus, he gets sad. The grief (sadness),
is the result of the desire to live, not because of death. 'I may

* If we perceive by applying our discrimination we come to know that the
body is wearing out every moment and it reaches a stage when it completely dies.
But we don't realize this fact because we don't pay attention to it. This is darkness
or ignorance (lack of discrimination). |
"
169,"126 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
live'—this desire is latent, and he has to die, and that causes
grief. But if he were to discriminate between the real and the
unreal, he need not be sad, he rather rejoices. Thus, it is because
of his ignorance, that he weeps. In his ignorance, he 1s like a
child, who weeps, while his old clothes are taken away and
he is made to put on new ones. To remove this ignorance, the
Lord has used 'yatha' (as) and 'tatha' (so) words, by giving an
illustration of clothes.

Lord Krsna, has used the verb ‘grhnati' for putting on
clothes and 'sarnyati' (enter), for embodied soul, because people
generally think out of ignorance, that man changes clothes,
living at his own place while an embodied soul has to go
and enter new bodies. So Lord Krsna, has used these two
verbs, keeping the worldly point of view in mind.

In the Gita in 'Yena sarvamidam tatam' (2/17), in 'Nityah
sarvagatah sthanuh' (2/24) phrases, the soul has been described as
all-pervading, eternal, omnipresent and constant, while in phrases
such as 'Sarnyati navani dehi' (2/22) and 'Sarirarn yadavapnoti'
(15/8), it is said that the soul migrates (enters) into another body.
So, there seems to be a contrast, but in fact, there is none. For
example, when a person grows from his babyhood to youth, he
says that he has grown young. But the fact is, that he is the same,
it is the body which has grown young. By identifying himself
with the body, he grafts the change of his body upon himself.
Therefore, in fact the soul does not migrate. But, because of Its
identification with bodies, It seems to migrate. |

Now, a question arises, why this cycle of birth and death,
has been going on from times, immemorial. From the view-point
of the Discipline of Action, to reap the fruit of virtuous and evil
actions, and from the view-point of the Discipline of Knowledge
due to ignorance, and from the view-point of the Discipline of
Devotion, due to disinclination for God, this cycle of birth and
"
170,"Verse 22] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI . 127
death goes on. The basic factor behind these three is, that God
has granted liberty to living beings, to make proper use of their
lives, but they misuse it and so they have to go through a cycle
of birth and death. They can be free from this cycle, by making.
proper use of this liberty. It means, that if they start working for
the welfare of others, by renouncing their selfishness, they will
be free from this cycle. Moreover negligence in discrimination*
is the root cause of birth and death. If we attach importance
to discrimination, we can be free from the shackles of
birth and death. Similarly, disinclination for God, is the cause
of birth and death, which can be eliminated by having an
inclination for Him.

Appendix—-A man wants new articles, so the Lord also gives
him new articles (body etc., material). When the body grows
old, God bestows upon him the new body. Therefore ‘having
new desires’ is the cause of his birth and death. Those who have
new desires, will get new things times without number. In a man
there is one power of the will and another of the life-breath. If
he has power of the will and his life-breath ends, he has to be
re-born. If he has no will (desire), he has not to take re-birth
when his life-breath ends. |

An illustration is applicable only to a certain extent, not to
the full extent. Here the illustration of casting off old clothes
and putting on new ones is applicable to the extent that as a
man, by changing several clothes, remains the same, similarly
the self, by casting off worn-out bodies and by acquiring several
new bodies, remains the same. As by casting off old clothes
we don’t die and by putting on new clothes we are not born,

* Negligence in discrimination means that we don't act according to what
we know. We know that it is wrong to tell a lie. But still we do so in order to
achieve selfish ends. We know that it is wrong to give pain to others. But we
derive sadistic pleasure in torturing others. Similarly we know that bodies are
perishable but. we have attachment and infatuation for them. This is known as an
affront to our knowledge. | |
"
171,"128 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
similarly by casting off worn-out bodies, we don’t die and by
acquiring new bodies, we are not born. It means that the body
dies, we (the self) don’t die. If we die, who will reap the fruit
of virtuous and sinful actions? Who will acquire new bodies?
Who will be in bondage? Who will attain salvation?

nainam chindanti Sastrani nainam dahati pavakah

na cainam kledayantyapo na Sosayati marutah

Weapons cannot cut the soul, nor can fire burn it, water cannot
drench it, nor can wind make it dry. 23 |
Comment:— —

'Nainam chindanti Sastrani'—Weapons cannot cut the soul
because they are made of the earth-element which cannot even
reach the soul. So how can they hurt the soul? .

‘Nainam dahati pavakah'—Fire cannot burn the soul, because
the soul is beyond the reach of fire. It means that fire can never
bring any change ever in it. .

""Na cainarn kledayantyapah'—Water cannot drench the soul
because water cannot wet it. Water can never bring any change in it.

'Na Sosayati marutah'—Wind cannot dry the soul because
it 1s beyond the reach of wind. It can never bring any change
in the least in it. —

Thus out of the five gross elements four cannot hurt the soul.
Now, the question arises—why has Lord Krsna not mentioned
the fifth element—ether? The answer is, that Akasa (ether) is
actionless. Earth, water, fire, wind are born of ether and these
are incapable of acting on ether. Therefore, when they cannot
"
172,"Verse 24] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI . 129
even hurt ether, how can they hurt the soul, which is. beyond
the reach of even Matter. or nature (prakrt1)? These elements
with attributes cannot reach the soul, which is without any
attributes (Gita 13/31). | | ne

The soul is eternal. All the four elements such as the earth etc.,
are activated by the power of the soul. So, how can they impair
the soul, the source of their power? The soul is all-pervading,
while the four elements, such as the earth etc., are the pervaded
ones. How can the pervaded ones, hurt the all-pervading one?

Here, the context is of war. Arjuna is grieved at the thought
of the imminent death, of his kinsmen. Therefore, Lord Krsna
explains to Arjuna that the soul cannot be hurt by any weapons.
A weapon can cut the body, not the soul, a fire-emitting missile
can burn the body, but not the soul, the Neptune noose (Varuna
weapon), can drench a body but not the soul, and the wind-
missile can dry the body but not the soul. It means that the soul
is not hurt by any weapons and missiles, it remains the same,
while it is the body alone which decays and dies. So, it is sheer
ignorance to lament for it.

Appendix—We say, ‘This is a body’—there is a change in
the body, but in ‘Is’ (Sariri) there is no change. Similarly when
we say, “There is wood or timber’, then there is variation in
wood, not in ‘Is’. Wood is cut, ‘Is’ is not cut. Wood burns, ‘Is’
does not burn. Wood becomes wet, ‘Is’ doesn’t get wet. Wood
dries, ‘Is’ does not get dry. Wood never remains uniform while
‘Is’ never becomes multiform. :

Comment:—

[In this verse it is described why weapons etc., cannot hurt
this soul.]

'Acchedyo'yam'—This soul is incapable of being -cut. Even
incantation and curse cannot cut this soul, while they can cut the
body, as Sakalya was beheaded by Yajiavalkya's curse, because
the former could not answer the latter's questions.

‘Adahyo'yam'—This soul cannot be burnt by fire, because it

: is Impervious to fire. It cannot be burnt even by incantation and
curses, as the hunter was burnt to ashes, by Damayanti's curse.
Only that can be burnt by fire, which is prone to fire. The soul
is beyond burning. ~ |

'Akledyah'—The soul is impervious to water. Water,
incantation, curse and medicines etc., cannot drench it. As it is
said, that the tune of 'MalakoSa song wets a stone, and moon-light
wets the moon-gem. But the soul cannot be wetted by them.

'ASosyah'—The soul cannot be dried by wind, incantation,
curse and medicines etc., as sage Agastya dried the sea.

'Eva ca'—By using these two words, Lord Krsna means to
say, that the soul is beyond the reach of any action. So it should
not be grieved for. :

_ ‘Nitya'—The soul is eternal, it remains the same all
the time.

‘Sarvagatah'—The soul pervades all men, things and bodies
etc., equally.

‘Acalah'—It 1s immovable, there is no movement in it.

'‘Sthanuh'—It is stable. It does not even shake or vibrate.

'‘Sanatanah'—It is everlasting and beginningless.
"
174,"Verse 25] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 131

The world is transitory, while the soul is eternal. Matter is
kaleidoscopic, while the soul is stable. All things and persons
etc., of the world are movable, while the soul is immovable
and all worldly objects, are subject to birth and decay, while
the soul is everlasting. |

Lord Krsna says that men identify themselves with bodies
and material things, and so they do not realize, that they are
different from worldly things, but even then, the soul remains
uniform and constant, all the time. |

Appendix—‘Sarvagatah’ (All-pervading)—the self does not
mere pervade a body but it is all-pervading—trealization of this
fact is salvation (liberation from worldly bondage). As the body
is seated in the world, we are not seated in the body. We (the
self) have never had our union with the body, we have no union,
won’t have any union and it is not possible to have a union with
the body. The body is quite afar from us. But because of desire,
the sense of mine and identification with the body it appears as
if we have union with the body.

In fact the Sariri doesn’t need the body at all. The Sarii
without the body, also remains in bliss.

‘Avyakto' yam'—The soul unlike a body is unmanifest, because
"
175,": 132 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
| it cannot be perceived by any one of the senses.

‘Acintyo'yam'—Mind and intellect etc., cannot be perceived
by senses but they are thinkable. But this soul is inscrutable.

‘Avikaryo'yamucyate'—The soul is immutable i.e., it does
not undergo any change while matter 1s changing, all the time.
The cause of the entire creation is matter. That causative nature
(matter) is subject to change. The soul is beyond any change,
as it is transcendental.

In the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth verses, Lord Krsna
has described the soul, by giving eight adjectives of negation
and four adjectives of affirmation. But the fact is that it cannot
be described in. words, because how can tongue illumine the
soul, which is an illuminator of the tongue etc.? Therefore, this
realization about the soul is, its real description.

'Tasmadevam viditvainam nanuSocitumarhasi'—Thus, by
knowing (realizing), the soul as uncleavable, incombustible,
unmanifest, everlasting and immutable etc., one cannot grieve.

if one thinks of the soul as changeable, (which is against the
basic (principle), one should not grieve.

O mighty-armed, even if you suppose this soul as
constantly undergoing birth and death, even then, you should not
grieve over it. 26 |
Comment:—

‘Atha cainam nityajatam nityam va manyase mrtam tathapi
tvam mahabaho naivarh Socitumarhasi'—Lord Krsna, by using the
"
176,"Verse 27] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 133
terms, such as ‘atha ca’ and 'manyase' means that it is a fact that
the soul is unborn (Gita 2/20), yet if you accept the contrary,
you should not grieve, because one who is born is bound to
die, and. one who dies, is bound to be reborn. None can escape
this eternal rule.

A seed sown in the earth, assumes different shapes—sprout,
plant, tree and then it dries up and decays. The fact is, that the
seed undergoes change, every moment. If this seed had remained
the same, even for a moment; how had it passed different stages
upto the last one of its drying up, as a tree? It gave up its prior
form—t is its death; and it assumes a new shape—t is its birth.
Thus it passes, through birth and death, every moment. Similarly,
this body also undergoes a change, every moment. Sperm gets
mixed with ovum and the mixture, grows into a baby which is
born. With its birth, the process of death sets in, which culminates
in death. Thus, this body undergoes a continuous change Le., it
is born, it decays and dies. |

Therefore Lord Krsna says to Arjuna that even if he holds
the view that the soul undergoes birth and death like a body,
there is still no ground for grieving.

Comment:—

‘Jatasya hi dhruvo mrtyurdhruvam janma mrtasya ca'—
According to the previous verse, if the soul is regarded as
constantly taking birth and constantly dying, one should not
"
177,"134 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
grieve, because death is sure of him who is born, and rebirth is
assured. of him who is dead.

""Tasmadapariharye'rthe na tvam Socitumarhasi'—This cycle
of birth and death has been going on from time immemorial and
will continue upto eternity. Therefore, you should not lament
over the inevitable. These Dhrtarastra's sons and Bhisma, Drona
etc., who are born will surely die, you cannot save them and
after death, they will certainly take rebirth, you cannot stop it.
So why should you grieve? |

As the sun has risen, it will certainly set, and if it is set, it
will definitely arise. This is an inevitable fact, which is known
to all. Therefore, none grieves over the setting of the sun. It
implies that one should not grieve over the death of anybody.

Whatever the Lord has stated in these two verses (26th and
27th) is not God's real theory. By the expression 'Atha ca’ the
Lord has put forth the argument of the people, who identify,
themselves with the body. This is not a correct principle. In no
case Arjuna should grieve. To bring home this point to him,
Lord Krsna has explained from that angle also.

In these two verses, Lord Krsna says that all the worldly
things, including the bodies, undergo change from one form to
another. Abandoning the first form is called death and change
to the second form is called birth. One should not grieve over
this cycle because it inevitably goes on. :

Appendix—A man is grieved if a dear one dies or there is
loss of money. Similarly we are grieved when we think about
the future—if the wife dies, what will happen? If the son dies,
what will happen? etc. We are grieved and worried because
we don’t attach importance to discrimination. Changes in the
world and in circumstances are inevitable. If circumstances don’t
change, how will the cycle of the world continue? How will a
person pass from boyhood to youth? How will a fool become
learned? How will a patient become healthy? How will a seed
"
178,"Verse 28] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 135
turn into a tree? Without change the world will become like a
static thing. In fact only a mortal dies, an immortal never dies.
It is everyone’s obvious experience that after death the body
remains lying, but the self, the owner of the body transmigrates.
If importance is attached to this experience, there can’t be any
worry or grief. At the death of Bali, Lord Rama draws Tara’s
attention towards this experience— : |
Tara bikala dekhi Raghuraya, dinha jiiana hari linht maya.
. Chiti:jala pavaka gagana samira, paiica racita ati adhama Sarira.

pragata so tanu tava a@gem sova, jiva nitya kehi lagi tumha rova.
upaja jiiana carana taba lagi, linhesi parama bhagati bara magi.

7 (Manasa, Kiskindha 11/2-3)

We should think over when no body remained in eighty-four
lac forms of life, how will this body remain intact? When eighty-
four lac bodies didn’t remain as ‘T’ and ‘mine’, how will this
body remain as ‘I’ and ‘mine’? This discrimination is possible
only in human body, not in other bodies.

Link:—In the next verse Lord Krsna mentions the simple
law of nature about birth and death.

‘Avyaktanidhananyeva'—These beings: will also not: be

'Vyaktamadhyani'—All these beings are manifest in the interim
(after birth and before death). Their bodies were non-existent
before birth and will remain non-existent after death, just like
in a dream. During life they seem to exist but actually they are
going into non-existence every moment. :

‘Tatra ka paridevana'—It is the principle that the thing which
does not exist either before or after has no real existence in its
midstate also. Therefore, these bodies which were unmanifest in
their origin and will be unmanifest in their end, are unmanifest
even now, though they seem visible. But the soul existed in the
past, exists now and will also exist in future. So there is no
point in lamenting for both these situation. |

Appendix—A thing, which does not exist at the beginning
and at the end, has never any existence, while a thing, which
exists at the beginning and at the end, ever exists.* That which
never exists, is “asat’—-unreal (body) and the entity which ever
exists, is “sat’—the reality. We have our eternal disunion with
the unreal while with the real we have our eternal union.

One perceives the soul as a wonder, some speak of it an
amazement while others hear of it in wonderment; while none
knows it even after hearing of it. 29
Comment:— | :

'Ascaryavatpasyati kaScidenam'—The knowledge of the
wondrous self is not achieved through the senses. The self can
be known by the self itself, it is beyond the realm of senses.
As ‘IT am’— this knowledge requires no proof, no instrument,
it is self-evident. Its consciousness cannot be experienced as
separate from 'I'. This is intuited by the person himself. This is
not a subject of senses and intellect. Therefore, the knowledge
of self is said to be a marvel.

The term 'pasyati’ has two meanings—to see with eyes and
to know the self by one's own self. Here it has been used in the
sense of knowing the self by one's own self (Gita 2/55; 6/20 etc..,).

When one sees with one's eyes, there are three things
necessary—the onlooker, the object to be seen and sight Le.,
the power to see. But while knowing the self these three are not .
necessary. 'I am'— this cannot be perceived by senses, mind and
intellect, but by one's own self.

When we want to search for a thing in a dark room, we need
"
181,"| - 138 : SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
eye-sight as well as light. But if there is light-lamp, there is no
need for another lamp to see the lamp which is lit. Similarly,
there is no need for other means to perceive the self. The self
has its own light by which it can be lit and known.

A body is of three kinds—physical (gross), subtle and
causal. The body which is nourished by food and water for its
growth, is physical (gross) body. This gross body is the object
of senses. The subtle body consists of seventeen elements—five
senses, five organs of action, five vital airs, mind and intellect.
The subtle body can be perceived by intellect and not by senses.
The latencies (vasanas) form the causal body. If we reflect, on
the three kinds of bodies, it is evident that the gross body is
not the self, as it changes every moment and it is an object

. of knowledge. Similar, is the case with the subtle body. The
causal body, is an evolute of nature. But the self is beyond
nature, therefore the causal body, 1s also not the self. As far
as, the knowledge of the self, is concerned, it is beyond them
and this knowledge is marvellous. This is. 'ascaryavatpasyati.’
When the soul ceases its identification with the body, it knows
itself and therefore, it has been said that one perceives the soul
as a wonder. -

Here in this verse, as well as, in the third verse of the seventh
chapter, Lord Krsna has used the term 'Kaéscit' i.e., ‘Someone
knows Me in reality.’ It means, that it is very difficult to know
the imperishable, but actually it is not so. The fact is, that it
seems difficult, only because there are a few aspirants, who
sincerely want to know the soul. - |

‘AScaryavadvadati tathaiva canyah'—Other persons speak
of it as marvellous, because it is beyond the reach of words.
Speech is illumined, by the self, then, how can it describe the
illuminator? The great souls who speak of it, can just give a
kind of hint to draw the attention of the listeners. |

Here, the term 'Anyah' has been used to emphasize the
"
182,"Verse 29] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 139
fact, that only a few liberated souls who possess metaphysical
knowledge, can explain it fully to an aspirant and enable him, to
attain the imperishable. All. do not possess the ability to remove
his doubts and give satisfactory answers, to his arguments.

‘AScaryavaccainamanyah srnoti'— Other persons hear of it, as
marvellous. Listening to scriptures and advice of other worlds, is
quite different from voice of the soul. It means, that this soul is
something marvellous and uncommon and is beyond the reach
of senses, mind and intellect etc. [t illuminates these.

Here, the term 'Anyah' has been used to explain the fact,
that the person who hears is different, from the one who knows,

: and from other who 1s capable of explaining it to an aspirant in

such a manner, that its full nature, is revealed to him.

‘Srutvapyenarn veda na caiva kascit'—There are some who do
not know it, even on hearing. It means that, merely hearing, will
not help one to know it. On hearing, when one gets established
in one's own self, one will know one's own self* by oneself.

. Now a question arises, that an aspirant on hearing the words
of scriptures and a preceptor, gets knowledge, why has it been
said then, that there are some who do not know it, even on
hearing of it? The answer is, that it is the aspirant himself, who
by having faith in the words of scriptures and preceptor, gains
knowledge. Otherwise there have been several incarnations of God,
and there also have been liberated souls, who held discourses on
metaphysics, and by hearing their discourses the people should
have gained metaphysical knowledge. But, actually it has not
happened. Their discourses, can be helpful to a striver having
faith, but he, will also have to get himself established in his own
self. This expression does not mean to convey, that knowledge
of the self is impossible; it rather conveys that it is beyond the
senses. However hard efforts by a man may make him to know

* This fact has been pointed out in the Gita several times—(2/55; 3/17;
6/20; 15/11). |
"
183,"140 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
it, ultimately he will have to know himself, by his own self.

What is knowing of the self, by the self? There is a difference
between doing, perceiving and knowing. Doing involves organs
of action, perceiving involves senses, while knowing is done
by the self Itself.

The senses actually do not know; rather they only perceive
which 1s useful in daily activity.

This knowledge, of knowing oneself by one's ownself, is of
two kinds—T am different from the body and the world;’ and
secondly, 'I have identity with God.’ In other words, it can be
said, ‘I have no affinity with the kaleidoscopic, perishable world,

while I have constant affinity with unchangeable, imperishable
God.’ After possessing this kind of knowledge, one can know the
soul in reality. This knowledge, is beyond the reach of speech
and intellect.

Appendix—tThe self cannot be known merely by hearing viz.,
by practice but can be known by having inquisition, by hearing
from enlightened and experienced exalted souls—‘yatatamapi
siddhanarn kaScinmarn vetti tattvatah’ (Gita 7/3). ‘AScaryavadvadati
tathaiva canyah’—it means that out of the enlightened exalted
souls, only someone. can explain its true nature to others. All
the enlightened souls can’t explain it.

As in the world a couple doesn’t get married merely by
hearing but the man and the woman accept each other as wife
and husband and then they are married. Similarly no one can
know God merely by hearing but after hearing, when he accepts
Him himself and gets established in Him, then he will know Him
by his own self. Therefore by hearing a man can learn the facts
pertaining to knowledge, can narrate them to others, can write
them, can lecture on them, can discuss them but can’t realize
the self or God.

One can’t know God merely by hearing but can know Him
by worshipping Him after hearing from others—‘srutvanyebhya
"
184,"Verse 30] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 141
upasate’ (Gita 13/25). If the person, who describes the Supreme
Soul, is a God-realized soul and the listener (striver) has esteemed
faith and inquisition, there can be immediate Self-realization.

dehi nityamavadhyo'yam dehe sarvasya bharata

tasmatsarvani bhitani na tvam Socitumarhasi

O Bharata, this soul residing in the bodies of all, can never be
slain. Therefore, you should not grieve, for any being. 30
Comment:—

‘Dehi nityamavadhyo'yam dehe sarvasya bharata'—The soul,
residing in bodies of men, gods, animals, birds, insects etc.,
cannot be slain i.e., it is imperishable. |

The term 'Avadhyah’, has two meanings—(i) It should not
be slain, (ii) It cannot be slain. For example, a cow should not
be killed, because it is a deadly sin to kill a cow. But in case
of the soul, it does not mean that it. should not be slain, but it |
means that the soul cannot be slain in anyway by anyone. It
has also been mentioned in 2/17, that none can bring about the
destruction of the indestructible substance.

'Tasmatsarvani bhitani na tvam Socitumarhasi'—Therefore,
you should not grieve for all beings because the soul is !
indestructible, while the perishable body cannot remain the
same even for a moment.

Here, ‘Sarvani bhuatani', plural number has been used to
emphasize the fact that, one should not grieve, for any living being.

The body is perishable, because its nature is such. It is
"
185,"142 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
perishing every moment. But, the self is imperishable. If this
reality is realized, then no grief is, possible.

In this section from the eleventh to the thirtieth verses, it
is explained that the soul, which is imperishable and real, is
different from a body which is perishable and unreal. Unless,
one can discriminate between the soul and the body, one cannot
follow anyone of the disciplines, either of Disinterested Action,
Knowledge or Devotion. Not only this, but also one who wants
to go to heaven should know, the distinction between the two.

| _ After the death of a body, who will go to heaven? Therefore, all

the philosophers who are believers, in spite of having different

opinions about philosophy, agree with the fact, that the soul is

. different from the body. Here the Lord wants to explain this
distinction clearly.

This is everyone's own experience also, that a body changes
from babyhood to youth and then to old age. But, there is an
unchangeable one that knows this change. That one, is the soul.
Therefore, the changeable and the unchangeable, can never be
identified. In this section, Lord Krsna, has not used a philosophical
terminology, because people think that philosophy is a subject
for study only. So he has-used such words as, the real and the
unreal, the perishable and the imperishable etc. One, who can
discriminate between the two, is not grieved in the least, while,
one who merely studies philosophy, is grieved. .

A man may study the six systems of philosophy and may

| possess knowledge about the Absolute, the soul, the Nature and
the world. But, his knowledge is purely theoritical. On the other
hand, a striver or a devotee may be concerned who wants to
realize his identity with God or who wants to surrender himself
to God, by renouncing his assumed affinity for prakrti, and the
world, his knowledge is practical. There is a vast difference in
these two sorts of knowledge. . .
"
186,"Verse 30] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 143

Appendix—The Lord has described the discrimination between
the ‘deha’ (body) and ‘dehi’ (possessor of the body) from the
eleventh to the thirtieth verses. While describing this topic Lord
Krsna has not used a philosophical terminology such as brahma-
jiva, prakrti-purusa, jada-cetana, maya-avidya, atma-anatma etc. —
The reason is that the Lord, instead of making it a subject for
study, wants to make it a subject of everyone’s experience and
wants to prove that every man can discriminate the body from
the self. It needs no study, no eligibility.

If a man applies the discrimination between the real and the
unreal on his body, he is a striver (seeker) and if he applies it on
the world, he is learned. By keeping himself aloof, if a person
discriminates between the real and the unreal, he may become
learned by possessing bookish knowledge (not learning) but he
can’t attain Self-realization. But he who discriminates between the
real and the unreal in his own body, can attain Self-realization.
It means that discrimination between the real and the unreal in
the world is for pedantry while the Gita is not for pedantry.
Therefore the Lord, instead of using the philosophical terminology,
has used simple words such as ‘deha-dehr’, ‘Sarira-Sariri’ viz.,
the body and its possessor. Those who discriminate between
the real and the unreal in the world, they keeping themselves
aloof, make themselves the authority on the knowledge of the
Gita. But any person, who discriminates the body from the self
in him, is eligible for Self-realization. For Self-realization the
discussion on discrimination between the body and the self, is
useful and in order to gain learning, the discussion on ‘tattva’
the Divinity is useful. Therefore the striver who wants to realize
the self, first of all should discriminate his own self from the
body that the body has no connection with the self and the self
has no connection with the body viz., ‘I am not body’. He, who
has assumed the existence and greatness (value) of the body
with as much truth, firmness, belief and doubtlessness, should
assume (accept) the existence and value of the Self (Soul) with
"
187,"144 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 2
the same truth, firmness, belief and. doubtlessness and should
realize the self. , | .

The body is the means only for performing an action and an
action is performed only for the world. As a writer uses a pen
only for writing and when he stops writing, he puts the pen at
its proper place, similarly a striver should use the body while
doing an action and should leave the body in its original position
when the work is finished—he should be detached from it. The
reason is that if we do nothing, what is the need of the body?

_ An important fact for a striver is to renounce the known
unreal. If a striver renounces what he knows as unreal, his
: spiritual discipline will become natural and easy and his aim
will be attained. The lovability of a striver for the end (aim) is
called his spiritual discipline. That lovability is not acquired by
anything, person, power etc., or by practice but that is acquired
by having the sense of ‘mine’. for the end (Lord). The ‘person
in whom a striver has the sense of ‘mine’, naturally becomes
lovable (dear) to him. But the real sense of mine is with that
object (or person) in which (or in whom) there are the following
four traits— oo

1. With whom we have identity (oneness) of the self.

2. With whom our relationship is eternal. |

3. From whom we never want anything.

4. To whom we may surrender all what we have. |

These four conditions are applicable only in God. The reason
is that our relationship with the body and the world 1s not eternal
and the category of the self is quite different from that of the
world and body. How can there be identity of the kaleidoscopic
world with the never changing self? The identity of the self with
the body, which is perceived, is not real but is assumed. This
assumed identity is only to perform duty. It means that we can
serve the person with whom.we have. assumed our identity but
we can’t have the sense of ‘mine’ with him. ,
"
188,"Verse 30] _SADHAKA-SANJIVANI (145 —

In order to renounce the known unreal, it is necessary that a
striver should renounce the relationship which our discrimination
does not support. Assuming a person, with whom we have neither
eternal relationship nor identity of the self, our own and for
us, is anti-discrimination relationship. So long as there is anti-
discrimination relationship, no spiritual discipline will lead to —
Self-realization. By having affinity with the body, a person may
undergo austere penance, may have trance, may go round the
world, his delusion can’t be destroyed and the Supreme Truth
can’t be attained. Having renounced the anti-discrimination
relationship delusion is destroyed and the Supreme Truth is
realized. Therefore a striver shouldn’t be at ease without renouncing
the anti-discrimination relationship. If we don’t renounce our
assumed anti-discrimination relationship with the body, the body
will leave us certainly. Then what is the difficulty in renouncing
our kinship with the body? Therefore a seeker may follow any
discipline, he will have to accept the truth, “I am not body and
the body is not mine and it is not for me because I am ‘aSariri’
(self) and the self is unmanifest.” st

So long as a striver has the kinship of ‘I and ‘mineness’
with the body there is no realization of the Supreme Truth and
he remains bound by virtuous actions, useful reflection and
attachment to Trance. He may perform virtuous actions such as
performance of sacrifice, undergoing penances, offering charity,
may reflect upon the soul or the Supreme Soul or be established
in trance, he is not totally free from bondage. The reason is
that assumption of the kinship of the self with the body is the
root of bondage and also of the flaw which causes all flaws. If
the assumed affinity of a striver with the body is totally wiped
out, sinful actions will not at all be performed by him and he
will not be attached to virtuous actions. There will not be any
meaningless reflection by him at all, and he will not be attached
to meaningful reflection. He will not be fickle in the least and
will neither be attached to trance, constancy or absence of all |
"
189,"146 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA _ [Chapter 2
thoughts. Thus at the destruction of attachment of the gross
(physical) body to actions, of the subtle body to reflection and
of causal body to constancy, his aim will be attained viz., his
delusion will be destroyed and the Supreme Truth will be realized.
Therefore the Lord at the outset of His gospel has described the
discrimination between the body and the self in order to wipe
out a striver’s (self’s) relationship with the body.
Link:—Arjuna was grieved, by apprehending the death of his
kinsmen and preceptors. Moreover he was afraid that sin would
accrue to him, by killing them and that sin would lead him to
hell. Therefore Lord Krsna preached this gospel in the eleventh
to the thirtieth verses. Now, He starts the worldly standpoint and
reminds Arjuna of his duty, as a member of the warrior class.

Looking at your own duty as well, you should not falter for
there is, nothing more meritorious to a person of the warrior
class (Ksatriya) than a righteous war. 31 | ,
Comment:— a
[In the first two verses, He describes the benefit of war.]
'Svadharmamapi caveksya na vikampitumarhasi'—Man (soul)
is a fragment of God. But by identifying himself with the body,
noting himself as a Brahmana (of the priest class) or a Ksatriya (of
the warrior class) etc., he has to discharge his duty as a member of
that class. Similarly one who acknowledging himself as a teacher
' ora father, has to discharge the duty of a teacher or a father.
Here, the duty of a Ksatriya has been called ‘Dharma’
(righteousness)*. It is the foremost duty of a Ksatriya not to
* In the eighteenth chapter (18/42— 48) the Lord has described the inate
"
190,"Verse 31] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 147
flee from war front. For a Ksatriya, righteousness is upheld by
waging war. So, Lord Krsna asks Arjuna to discharge his duty,
by waging war. He should never shirk that duty.
'Dharmyaddhi yuddhacchreyo'nyatksatriyasya na vidyate'—
There is nothing more welcome to a man of the warnor. class
than a righteous war viz., which is his main duty (Gita 18/43).
Similar, is the case with, the people of other classes—the priest,
the business and the labour classes. |
Arjuna, in the seventh verse of the second chapter, requested
Lord Krsna to tell him what is good for him. In response to his
request, Lord Krsna tells him, that he would attain salvation by
performing his duty of waging a righteous war. So, he should
not retreat from it. : _
Appendix—Having described the discrimination between
‘deha’ (body) and ‘dehi’ (self) the Lord from this verse to the
thirty-eighth verse describes the performance of one’s duty.
The reason is that the Supreme Truth which is realized by the
discrimination between ‘deha’ and ‘dehi’, the same Supreme
Truth can be realized by the proper use of the body, by
- performing one’s duty. In discrimination ‘knowing’ is. important
and in performance of one’s duty ‘doing’ is important. Though
discrimination is important for a man, as it is useful for him
in practical and spiritual life and also in this world as well as
the other world, yet the Lord mentions performance of one’s
duty for the person, who doesn’t understand the discrimination
between the body and the self, so that instead of becoming a
scholar by possessing bookish knowledge or rot learning, he
may realize the Truth. oo |
It means that a person who wants to know Godhead
but without having a keen intellect and a keen self-denial
(detachment), couldn’t know Him by the Discipline of |
duties of the people of four castes. There the term Dharma’ (18/47) stands for
one’s duty. Thus the terms ‘Karma’ and ‘Dharma’ are synonymous.
"
191,"148 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
Knowledge, he can know the Supreme Soul by the Discipline
of Action (Gita, 5/4-5). :

Arjuna was a Ksatriya (member of the warrior class).
Therefore the Lord has mentioned the duty of a Ksatriya.
In fact here ‘the duty of a Ksatriya’ is the denotation for
the duties of the four ‘Varnas’. Therefore it means that the

members of other “Varnas’ (castes) such as Brahmana (member
of the priest class) etc., should also discharge their duties
(Gita, 18/42—44). [‘Svadharma’ (one’s own duty) has been
mentioned as “Svabhavaja karma’, ‘Sahaja karma’ and ‘Svakarma’
etc., (Gita 18/42—48). Discharge of one’s duty for the welfare
of others, by renouncing selfishness, pride and the desire for
fruit, is performing ‘svadharma’. Discharge of ‘Svadharma’ (one’s
duty) is “Karmayoga’ (the Discipline of Action).]

refused to give them, even as much land as could be covered
by the point of a needle, without waging war. The Pandavas
made several efforts for a compromise, but Duryodhana bluntly
refused. Therefore, Lord Krsna says to Arjuna, ""You have got
this unsought and unsolicited opportunity, for waging a war.
Such a righteous war, is an open gateway to heaven.” |

‘Sukhinah ksatriyah partha labhante yuddhamidrsam'—Those

Ksatriyas, who get such an opportunity are really lucky.

discharging one's duty, is far superior to worldly pleasures which
could be enjoyed, even by animals and birds.

the sixth verse of this chapter, Arjuna raised a question that
they did not know whether they would conquer the sons of

. [Arjuna was thinking that by killing his kinsmen he would
incur sin. So Lord Krsna clarifies that it is not the war but desire,
which induces a man to incur sin. So by renouncing desire, he
should be engaged in war.] | |
""Sukhaduhkhe same krtva labhalabhau jayajayau tato yaddhaya
yujyasva'—In a war a man either gains victory or suffers defeat.
Victory results in gain, while defeat results in loss. Worldly
: people, view gain with pleasure and loss with pain. But your
aim is not to think of victory and defeat, gain and loss, and
pleasure and pain, but your goal is to discharge your duty by
treating the agreeable and the disagreeable, alike. By doing so
you will incur no sin viz., you will be free from bondage.

_. Everyone should discharge his duty earnestly and efficiently,

, whether he has a desire or not for its fruit. By refusing to be
affected by favourable and unfavourable circumstances, the mind
becomes steady. So treating the two equally, one should discharge
one's duty. Moreover, one should not perform an action for the
sake of pleasure, and refrain from another, for fear of its pain.
Scriptures should be the authority in determining what ought to
be done and what ought not to be done (Gita 16/24).

_ ‘'Naivarh papamavapsyasi'—Here, the word, sin, has been
used both for sin and virtue. The former, leads to the bondage
of hell and the latter to the constraints of heaven. Both of these
deprive a man of salvation and binds him to follow the cycle

of birth and death. So, Lord Krsna exhorts Arjuna, to discharge
his duty of waging war, by being even-minded. This will help

him to escape the bondage of both sin and virtue.
In this section of eight verses from the thirty-first to the thirty-
"
198,"Verse 38] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI — 155
eighth Lord Krsna has disclosed several variegated feelings.

(1) While delivering a discourse or explaining a subject, the
beginning should deal with positive aspects, the middle with
negative aspects and the conclusion should again deal with positive
aspects. In this context also, Lord Krsna in the thirty-first and
thirty-second verses, explains the favourable consequences of
discharging one's duty; in the middle from the thirty-third to the
thirty-sixth verses, He explains the adverse consequences of not
performing one's duty; and again concludes, in the thirty-seventh
and thirty-eighth verses, by explaining the favourable consequences
of discharging the duty and orders Arjuna to act accordingly.

(ii) In these verses, Lord Krsna has also clarified the doubts
arising in the mind of Arjuna. For example Arjuna says, ""I don't
foresee any good, ensuing from the slaughter of kinsmen"" (1/31).
Lord Krsna replies in 2/31, ""There is nothing more welcome ,
to a man of the warrior class, than a righteous war."" In 1/37
Arjuna says,""How can we, by killing our kinsmen, be happy?""
Lord Krsna replies in 2/32, ""Happy are the Ksatriyas who get
the opportunity of waging such an, unsolicited warfare."" In 1/44
Arjuna says, ""The consequence of the war will lead to hell."" In |
2/32,37 Lord Krsna says, “The war is an open gateway to heaven.”
In 1/36 Arjuna says, ""Sin alone will accrue to us by waging the |
war and by slaying them.” Lord Krsna replies in 2/33, ""If you
do not wage such a righteous war and abandon your duty, you
will incur sin."" In 1/40 Arjuna says, ""The result of the war will
be that impiety will take hold of the entire family."" Lord Krsna
in 2/33 says, ""If you do not wage such a righteous war, you
will abandon your duty viz., righteousness.""

(a) In 2/5 Arjuna insists and says, ""It is better to live on
alms, than to wage war."" Therefore, Lord Krsna in 2/38, orders
him to wage war. Uddhava had a desire to live with Lord Krsna.
So Lord Krsna directed him to go to the northern mountains
and do penance there (Srimadbhagavata 11/29/41). It means that,
"
199,"| 156 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
desire of any type is an obstacle to salvation.

_ (iv) In these verses Lord Krsna has explained in details some
of the things which were referred to in brief, in the second and
third verses of this chapter. For example earlier the expression
‘anaryajustam’' (it is shunned by noble souls) was used, here the

expression ‘dharmyaddhi yuddhacchreyo'nyat' (any other thing more
welcome than a righteous war) has been used. There the term

‘asvargyam’ (not leading to heaven), was used here the expression

| ‘svargadvaramapavrtam, (an open gateway to heaven), has been
_ used. There the term ‘akirtikaram' not bringing fame was used,
: here the expression ‘akirtim capi bhitani kathayisyanti te'vyayam’'

(all creatures will even recount your undying infamy) has been
used. There, Lord Krsna ordered Arjuna to fight by using the
expression ‘tyaktvottistha parantapa’ here, also, He orders him
the fight by using the expression 'tato yuddhaya yujyasva’.

_ Appendix—The Gita teaches the remarkable art of spiritual
upliftment through one’s own dealings so that a person, under
all circumstances, having all kinds of dealings sanctioned by

the scriptures, may attain salvation. Generally other scriptures
mention that if you want to attain salvation, become a recluse by
renouncing mundane materials and live in solitude because the
mundane affairs and spiritual upliftment can’t go together. But
the Gita declares that at whatever place you are, whatever sect
you follow, whatever principle you live up to, whatever religion,
school of thought, ‘Varna’ (caste), ‘Asrama’ (stage of life) you
follow, by following them if you act according to the gospel of
the Gita, it will lead you.to salvation. The Supreme Truth, which
recluses and saints attained in solitude by practising spiritual
discipline for years together, will be attained in practical worldly
life by following the teachings of the Gita. By becoming even-
minded in success and failure, performance of one’s duty without
the desire for fruit, is to act according to the gospel of the Gita.
What can be more terrible circumstance and activity (action)
"
200,"Verse 39] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 157
than a war? When a man can attain salvation under such a terrible
circumstance and activity as a war, then what other more terribe
circumstance and activity will be there in which he may not attain
salvation? According to the Gita sitting on a seat in loneliness
and meditating on God can lead to salvation (Gita 6/10—13)
and waging a war can also lead to salvation.

Arjuna wanted neither heaven nor kingdom (Gita 1/32, 35,
2/8). He wanted to turn away from the sin which would accrue
by killing his kith and kin (Gita 1/36, 39, 45). Therefore the Lord
appears to say, “If you don’t covet heaven and kingdom and want
to turn away from the sin, discharge your duty of fighting in the
war treating the agreeable and the disagreeable alike, thus you will
incur no sin—‘naivam papamavapsyasi’. The reason is that sin is
not incurred by waging war; but uneven-mindedness (partiality),
desire, selfishness and ego are the causes of sin. It is your duty
(dharma) to wage war. Sin is incurred by not performing one’s
duty and by doing which should not be done.” |

In the preceding verse the Lord seemed to say to Arjuna, “If

you want to gain kingdom and heaven, it is proper for you to

| perform your duty,” while in this verse He seems to say, “If you

don’t want to gain kingdom and heaven, it is proper for you to

discharge your duty by being even-minded.” It means that it is

improper not to discharge one’s duty under any circumstances.

to be guided by even-mindedness, already mentioned in the
preceding verse and he describes its glory.

O Partha (Arjuna), this attitude of mind has been presented to
you from the point of view of Jnanayoga (Discipline of Knowledge);
now hear of the same, from the point of view of Karmayoga
(the Discipline of Selfless-Action). Equipped with this state
of mind, you will be able to completely shake off the shackles
of Karma (Action). 39 |
Comment:— | | |

‘Es te’bhihita sankhye buddhiryoge tvimam Srnu'—Here the
word. 'Tu' (indeed) has been used to show that the description
of the Discipline of Action, is different from the Discipline of
Knowledge. —

The term ‘Esa’ has been used for equanimity, which has
been described in the preceding verse and which has already been
explained in the Discipline of Knowledge, (from the eleventh to
the thirtieth verses). When a man discriminates between the body
and the soul, he gets established in equanimity automatically
because it is attachment to the body which is an obstacle in the
way of equanimity. So this ideal of equanimity has already been
presented from the point of. view of ‘Sankhyayoga’ (Discipline
of Knowledge); now listen to a discourse on equanimity in the
context of 'Karmayoga’ (Discipline of Action).

‘Imam’ (this) term has been used to explain how this
equanimity is attained by the Discipline of Action and what its

_ importance is?

""Buddhya yukto yaya partha karmabandham prahasyasi'—
Arjuna was afraid of the sin that would accrue by waging the
war (1/36, 45). But Lord Krsna says that sin does not accrue
by waging the war as it is your duty, but it accrues by having
attachment and aversion. So if you attain equanimity, no sin
"
202,"Verse 39] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 159
will accrue and your duty of waging the war, will not lead you
to bondage. |

In the seventh verse of this chapter Arjuna asked Lord Krsna to

advise him what was good for him. Hence, Lord Krsna answers his
query. First, He mentioned the means of Sankhyayoga (Discipline
of Knowledge), and then laid great stress on performance of
duty, and told him that there was nothing more welcome to a
Ksatriya, than a righteous war (2/31). Then, He told him that
no sin would accrue, if he had equanimity ( 2/38). Now, He
explains the same equanimity, in the context of 'Karmayoga’
(Discipline of Action).

A Karmayogi performs action to set an example, to the
masses (Gita 3/20) without any selfish motive. By doing so,
he attains equanimity, easily. Having attained equanimity, he is
easily liberated, from the bondage of actions.

This (Thirty-ninth) verse, should have been placed after the
thirtieth verse, as it rightly belonged there, because from the _
eleventh verse to the thirtieth verse, the Lord explained even-
mindedness, from the view-point of the Discipline of Knowledge,
and now He describes it from the view of Discipline of Action.
So it seems improper, to insert these eight verses, from the thirty-
first to the thirty-eighth, here. But really it is not so. The reason
is, that before describing equanimity in the Discipline of Action,
it is necessary to describe, what one ought to do and what one
ought not to do. It was Arjuna's duty, to wage a righteous war. It
was not his duty to abandon war, because by doing so, he would
incur sin. So Lord Krsna, in these eight verses, described what
Arjuna ought to do and what he ought not to do (2/3 1—38). Then,
he explained equanimity. It means, that first from the eleventh
verse to the thirtieth verse, he explained equanimity, through as
elucidation of the real and the unreal, by mentioning that the
real is real and the unreal is unreal and none can change these.
Then, from the thirty-first verse to the thirty-eighth verse, having
"
203,"160 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
explained what one ought to do, and what one ought not, from.
the thirty-ninth verse, He exhorts Arjuna never to desist from

| his duty, but to always perform duty with even-mindedness, in
success and failure.

Appendix—‘Karmayoga’ (Discipline of Action) is divided into
two parts—‘kartavya vijnana’ (the science of duty) and ‘Yoga
vijfiana’ (the science of equanimity). The Lord from the thirty-first
verse to the thirty-seventh verse mentioned the science of duty in
which He described the favourable consequences of discharging
the duty and adverse consequences of not discharging the duty.
Now from this verse to the fifty-third verse He mentions the

: science of equanimity. ,

The equanimity which the Lord mentioned in the preceding
verse, can be attained both by ‘the Discipline of Knowledge’
and ‘the Discipline of Action’. By knowing the discrimination
between the body-division and the self-division and renouncing
affinity with the body-division, is “The Discipline of Knowledge’
while by knowing the duty-division and the non-duty-division and
by renouncing what ought not to be done and discharging one’s
duty, is ‘the Discipline of Action’. A man by following one of
the two disciplines should attain equanimity. The reason is by
attaining equanimity a man is freed from the bondage of action.

One is ‘Dharma Sastra’ (Pirva mimarhnsa) [The scripture for
duty] and one is ‘moksa sastra’ (Uttara mimarhsa) [The scripture
for salvation). Here from the thirty-first verse to the thirty-seventh
verse, there is description of ‘Dharma Sastra’, while from the
thirty-ninth verse to the fifty-third verse there is description of
‘Moksa Sastra’. By ‘Dharma astra’ (discharging one’s duty) there
is both kinds of progress*—mundane and spiritual. In ‘Dharma
Sastra’ the discharge of one’s duty is important. Either call it
‘Dharma’ or duty—it is one and the same.

Not to do what ought to be done is ‘non-discharge of duty’

* ‘vato’ bhyudayanihsreyasasiddhih sa dharmah’ (VaiSesika 1/3, 2/39).
"
204,"Verse 40] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 161
and to do what ought not to be done is also ‘non-discharge of
duty’. Duty is that in which a person having renounced his desire
for pleasure, pleases others and which involves his own welfare as
well as the welfare of others. By discharging one’s duty, ‘Yoga’
(equanimity) is naturally attained. Without discharging one’s
duty a man can’t attain equanimity (Gita 6/3). Having attained
equanimity, knowledge of Truth is naturally attained—-which is
the result of both—‘Karmayoga’ (the Discipline of Action) and
‘Jnanayoga’ (the Discipline of Knowledge). | |

In this path (of selfless action), there is neither loss of effort, nor
any adverse result. Even a little practice of this discipline (dharma)
protects one from great danger (of birth and death). 40
Comment:— |

[Lord Krsna has explained the importance of disinterested
action in the latter part of the thirty-ninth and this fortieth verse
in four ways:—{i) By it, one becomes free from shackles of
actions. (ii) There is no loss in effort. (111) There is no adverse
result. (iv) Even a little practice of it (dharma) protects, one
from great fear.]

'Nehabhikramanaso'sti'—In this path of disinterested action,
there is no loss of attempt viz., the partial practice of this Yoga
(Discipline of Disinterested Action) has its corresponding benefit.
The desire to attain equanimity is the beginning of equanimity.
Such a beginning never gets wasted because desire for attaining
the real is also real. | |

‘Tha’ (in this) means that in this world human beings are
"
205,"162 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter2
authorized to attain equanimity. All other bodies (births) are to
enjoy worldly pains and pleasures, there is no opportunity for
them to do away with attachment and aversion because pleasures
can be enjoyed only by having attachment and aversion. If there
are no attachment and aversion, no pleasure can be enjoyed and
such actions will lead to spiritual discipline.

'Pratyavayo na vidyate'—Actions which are performed with
a desire for fruits, can give adverse result, if there is any error
in the pronunciation of incantations, or in performing sacrifice,
etc. Suppose, a man performs sacrifice, for the birth of a son,
but if it is not performed according to scriptures, it might result
in the death, of a member of the family, instead of blessing him
with a son. Sometime, if the result is not quite contrary, it may
be less harmful, as the son may be born crippled. But, one who
performs actions, without having any desire for fruits, becomes
equanimous and so there is no adverse result from his effort.

What is adverse result? Unevenness of mind, is an adverse
result. Attachment and aversion, is unevenmindedness. This
uneven-mindedness leads to a cycle of birth and death. But,
when a man becomes equanimous, attachment and aversion, are
rooted out and on annihilation of attachment and aversion, there
is no unevenness of mind, and therefore any adverse result, is
out of the question.

'Svalpamapyasya dharmasya trayate mahato bhayat'—Even
a little practice, of this discipline of disinterested action, which
brings about equanimity, protects one from the great fear of
birth and death. So unlike action for fruits, which ends after its
fruits, it does not perish viz., its fruit is not wealth or property,
which are perishable. Equanimity, which a striver attains, by
facing favourable and unfavourable circumstances, gets fixed _
in him and becomes permanent. A devotee (striver), deviating
from the path of Yoga, having enjoyed heavenly pleasures for

- many years and having taken birth in the houses of righteous
"
206,"Verse 40] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI | 163
persons, does not lose knowledge or even-mindedness gained,
in his previous birth (Gita 6/40—45) because this knowledge or
even-mindedness, is real. , —
‘Dharma’ (Duty) is used in two senses—(i) Charity viz.,
kindness, in giving help (money, food, clothes etc.,) to the poor,
and suffering people (11) Discharging one's duty; according to
the ordinance of scriptures. By performing one's duty, without
desiring its fruit, one develops equanimity automatically, because
it is axiomatic. Therefore, here, equanimity has been called
‘Dharma’ (duty). :
Some people opine constant remembrance of God is not useful
unless there is concentration of mind. But the gospel of the Gita,
does not attach much importance to this opinion, it attaches more
importance to equanimity. According to the Gita, a striver who
has attained equanimity, is an exalted soul. Even when, a man
is imbued with all qualities, if he does not gain equanimity,
according to the Gita, he cannot be called, a perfect soul.
This equanimity, is of two kinds—of the mind and of the self.
The Lord, pervades everywhere equally. One who gets oneself
established, in Him, gains victory over the world, and is liberated.
But this equanimity of self, can be known by equanimity
of the mind (Gita 5/19). Equanimity of the mind, consists in
remaining even-minded, in success and failure (Gita 2/48).
Such a person, remains even-minded in praise and reproach,
success and failure, profit and loss, pleasure and pain etc.,
(Gita 5/20). This sort of equanimity, never perishes and it
results in nothing, but salvation. |
Whatever, virtuous actions, such as penance, charity and
pilgrimage etc., are performed by a man, these perish after
giving fruit, but equanimity, does not perish and it leads man
to salvation or God-realization (Gita 5/3), while concentration
"
207,"164 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA . [Chapter 2
of mind, may lead him to accomplishments (siddhis) but not
. to salvation. .

Appendix—-The Lord has mentioned the glory of equanimity
in four ways in the thirty-ninth and fortieth verses—

(i) ‘karmabandham prahasyasi’—By equanimity a man shakes
off the shackles of Karma (action).

(ii) ‘nehabhikraman3So’sti’—There is no loss of effort.

(iii) ‘pratyavayo na vidyate’—There is no adverse result of
this effort. | |

(iv) ‘svalpamapyasya dharmasya trayate mahato bhayat’—Even
a little practice of this discipline (dharma) protects one from the
great danger of birth and death. |

Though in the first point the three remaining points are
included, yet there is a little difference in them; as—

(i) The Lord first in the normal way declares that by
equanimity a man shakes off the shackles of Karma (action).
The reason of bondage is the attachment to the modes viz., it is
his assumed affinity with Prakrti (Matter) and its evolutes (Gita
13/21). In equanimity there is no affinity with Prakrti and its
evolutes; therefore the man is freed from the shackles (bondage)
of action. As in the world many virtuous and sinful actions
are done, but those actions don’t bind us because we have no
relationship with them, similarly the even-minded person has no
relationship with the actions done by his body.

(ii) If equanimity merely begins viz., there is an aim of
attaining equanimity, there is inquisitiveness to attain it, then this
beginning is not destroyed. The reason is that the aim to attain
the imperishable is also imperishable while the aim to gain the
perishable, is also perishable. The aim to gain the perishable leads
to destruction (fall) while the aim to attain equanimity leads to
salvation—‘jijiidsurapi yogasya Sabdabrahmativartate’ (Gita 6/44).

(ii1) There is no adverse result of this equanimity. If there
"
208,"Verse 40] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 165
ener Ee
is any error in pronouncing the sacred text in the performance
of actions which are done. with a desire for fruits, the result of
those actions can be adverse.* But if there is equanimity in life,
and an error is committed, and if there is slip in carefulness, the
action does not give adverse result (bondage). For example if
a paid servant while lighting a lantern in the dark drops it and
breaks it, we are angry with him. But if our friend who never
wants anything from us, drops the lantern and it is broken, we
don’t get angry but ask him not to mind it as it matters little.
Therefore he who performs actions with the desire for fruit, may
have adverse result of his actions but how can the result of the
actions of the person, who doesn’t covet any fruit, he adverse?
It can’t be. |

(iv) Even a little equanimity protects one from the great
danger of birth and death viz., it results in salvation. As actions
done with an interested motive perish after bearing fruit, in that
way even a little equanimity does not perish after bearing fruit
but it only leads to salvation. If virtuous actions such as religious
sacrifice, charity and penance etc., are performed with a desire for
fruit, their result is perishable (gain of money, wealth and heaven

* There is a mythological story that Tvasta performed a religious sacrifice
in order to get a son who would kill Indra. In that sacrifice the sages performed
the sacrifice with the sacred text ‘indraSatrurmh vivardhasva’. In the word
‘indraSatru’ if there is ‘sasthitatpurusa’ compound-word, it means “Indra’s enemy’
and if there is ‘bahuvrhi’ compound-word, it means ‘he whose enemy is Indra.’
By the difference of ‘samasa’ (compound-word), there is difference in sound.
Therefore in ‘sasthitatpurusa’ compound word, the word ‘indraSatru’s’ last letter
‘try’ will be pronounced with ‘udatta’ sound while in ‘bahuvrihi’ compound-word,
the word ‘indraSatru’s’ first letter ‘1’ will be pronounced with ‘udatta’ sound. The
aim of the sages was to do the ‘antyodatta’ pronunciation of the word “indraSatru’
but they did ‘adyedatta’ pronunciation. So because of the difference in sound
in the pronunciation of the sacred text there was adverse result and thus Indra
became the killer of Vrtrasura, Tvasta’s son. Therefore it is said:

mantro hinah svarato varnato va mithyaprayukto na tamarthamaha
sa vagvajro yajamanam hinasti yathendraSatruh svarato’ paradhat

: (Paniniya Siksa)
"
209,"——

166 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
etc.,) and if they are performed without the desire for fruit, their
result is imperishable (salvation). Thus virtuous actions such as
sacrifice, charity.and penance etc., can bear two types of fruit
but the fruit of equanimity is only salvation. As a traveller, while
travelling stops on the way or sleeps, he has not to go back to
the place from where he started his journey but he has covered
the distance upto the place where he stops or sleeps. Similarly

as much equanimity is attained in. life, that never perishes.
-_‘syalpamapyasya dharmasya trayate mahato bhayat’—Even a
little feeling of disinterest is true while fear even being great is
untrue. As for a bundle of cotton, a lot of fire is not required,
| the cotton may be one bundle or a hundred bundles, a match
stick is enough to burn it. When one match stick is applied to
the cotton, the cotton itself becomes fire and helps in burning
the remaining cotton. In the same way detachment is fire and
the world is cotton. Being detached from the world, the world
itself perishes because the world in fact has no existence at the

| root, so one can’t be attached to it.
. The least renunciation 1s real and the biggest action is unreal.
An action ends while renunciation is endless. Therefore actions such
as sacrifice, charity and penance etc., perish after giving fruit (Gita
8/28) but renunciation (renunciation of the fruit of action) never
perishes—‘tyagacchantiranantaram’ (Gita 12/12). By renouncing
the egoistic notion only, infinite universes are renounced because
this sense of ego has sustained the entire universe (Gita 7/5).
There may be a big heap of grass, can it face fire? It may be
very dark, can it face light? If there is a fight between darkness
and light, will darkness win? Similarly if there is a fight between
ignorance and knowledge, will ignorance win? Can the greatest
| fear face fearlessness? Equanimity even if it is a little is complete
and fear even if great is incomplete. A little equanimity is great
. because it is true and the great fear is little (without existence)
: because it is untrue. |
"
210,"Verse 41] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 167

What is the import of calling equanimity or the feeling of
disinterestedness ‘a little.’ The feeling of disinterestedness: is
great, but we understand and experience it a little, so it has been
called a little. In fact our understanding is a little, equanimity is
not a little. Our view has not grasped it fully, so there is defect
in our view, not in equanimity. Similarly we have valued the
unreal more, it does not mean that the unreal is great but value
accorded by us is great. Therefore if we value the real more,
the real will become great viz., its value will be realized and
if we don’t value the unreal, the unreal will become a little.
In fact the unreal may be great or a little; it has no existence
‘nasato vidyate bhavah’ and the real may be great or a little, its
existence is ever present—‘na bhavo vidyate satah’. Therefore
in Upanisads the Supreme Soul has been called smaller than a
molecule and the biggest of all—‘anoraniyan mahato mahiyan’
(Katha. 1/2/20, Svetasvatara 3/20).

vyavasayatmika buddhirekeha kurunandana

bahusakha hyanantasca buddhayo'vyavasayinam

O Joy of the Kurus, in this blessed path, the intellect is
determinate and concentrated, whereas the intellect of the
undecided (infirm), is scattered in many directions, and is
endlessly diverse. 41
Comment:— :

'Vyavasayatmika buddhirekeha kurunandana'—To a seeker
of God-realization, the intellect is determinate and single-pointed
viz., he has only one decision and that is to attain equanimity,
"
211,"168 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
in the form of God-realization. Attachment to the world, is the
main obstacle to this attainment of equanimity, and that can be
removed, through determinate intellect.

Why is determinate intellect one? The reason is, that in
it there is renunciation of desire, for worldly objects etc. This
renunciation of desire is singular, whether it pertains to wealth
and riches or honour and praise. But, there are objects of different
types and a person wants to acquire these. Just as, there are
different kinds of objects, such as different kinds of sweets, in
the same way, there are endless desires for acquiring numerous
objects of various types in various ways. Therefore, a desirous
person cannot have one intellect.

In the Discipline of Action (in this verse), and in the
Discipline of Devotion (in 9/30), there is mention of intellect,
which is determinate and single-pointed, but it is not so, in the
Discipline of Knowledge. The reason is, that in the Discipline
of Knowledge, one comes to know the self first, and then his
intellect becomes determinate and pointed, while in the Discipline
of Action, as well as Devotion, it is the determinate intellect
which comes first and then it is followed by self-realization.
Therefore, in the Discipline of Knowledge there is importance
of knowledge, while in the Disciplines of Devotion and Action,
there is importance of a single-minded pursuit.

'‘Bahusakha hyanantasca buddhayo'vyavasayinam— he infirm
in mind being desire-ridden, clings to pleasure and prosperity,
and so the intellect of such persons, grow endlessly. For example,
they may have a desire to get a son, the means adopted for
the fulfilment of other desire, such as medicine, incantation, :
oblation and blessings of a saint etc., are branches of the same
desire. Similarly, a man wants to get money of this is one desire
(intellect) and to get it through business, service, theft, robbery,
cheating etc., are many branches, of that intellect. Such a man,
with endless desires, having many branches cannot even take
"
212,"Verse 42-43] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 169
decision about God-realization.

Appendix—The real aim is only one. Unless a man has
a singular aim, he has endless aims and there are numerous
branches of each aim. He has endless desires and the means for
the fulfilment of each desire are also many.

But the fact is, that a man himself is a fragment of God
and thus, is eternal while desires are fleeting and these increase
and decrease. The self and desire, are totally distinct. But desire-
"
213,"170 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
ridden people, never realize this distinction and it is only out of
delusion that they identify themselves with desire.

'Svargapara'—They look upon heaven and its pleasure, as
their supreme goal and all their efforts are directed towards that
base end. Here the term ‘Svargapara’, refers to such men, who
have faith and belief in heaven etc., as described, in the Vedas
and scriptures. 7 |

""Vedavadarataéh partha nanyadastiti vadinah'—~-They are
interested in the Vedas, only for the sake of the ritualistic
contents, which deal with earthly and heavenly pleasure. The
aim of their life, is to enjoy celestial pleasure here, and hereafter,

| rather than to attain God-realization, or emancipation. _

'Yamimam puspit4mh vacarh pravadantyavipascitah—They
cannot discriminate between, the real and the unreal, the perishable
and the imperishable. Such unwise persons utter flowery words
of the Vedas, which describe and recommend various acts, for
the attainment of pleasure and prosperity.

Here, the word ‘puspitam' has been used to show that such
speech is just flowery with an attractive appearance, without
bearing any permanent fruit. Satisfaction, comes out of fruit
only, not from flowers and leaves.

'Janmakarmaphalapradam'—That flowery way instead of
giving any permanent and eternal fruit, gives fruit which
prolongs the wheel of birth. In language flowery importance
is attached to pleasure, and attachment to pleasure is the
cause of birth (Gita 13/21).

'Kriyavisesabahulam bhogaisvaryagatim prati'—That, flowery
utterance deals with a number of rituals for the attainment of
pleasure and prosperity. In these rituals there is abundance of
different kinds of rites, involving various methods, actions,

' objects and much strenuous physical labour (Gita 13/21).

'Bhogaisvaryaprasaktanam'—Pleasures of five senses—sound,

touch, colour, taste, smell, comfort to the body, and desire

for respect and praise are 'bhoga', (the worldly enjoyments).

Accumulation of money and material to enjoy those worldly

pleasure, is called 'aiSvarya’ (prosperity). Those who cling to

pleasure and prosperity, are called 'Bhogaisvaryaprasaktanam.’

Such people are called demoniacal* (asura). In sarnskrta 'asu' stands

for life-breath and he who wants to maintain life-breath is an 'asura’.
'Vyavasayatmika buddhih samadhau na _ vidhiyate'—Such

people, who instinctively cling to pleasure and prosperity
cannot attain the determinate intellect to realize God, because
their intellect has become impure. Similarly, the people who
have pride for their being learned, by acquiring the worldly
arts or science or knowledge etc., cannot attain the determinate
intellect, (decision), to realize God. |
All-gracious God, by His grace has bestowed discrimination
* The people possessing the mode of passion who are being described here
have been called people possessing demoniacal traits in the sixteenth chapter by
the Lord (16/11, 16/16).

upon human beings, so that they may attain God or salvation. But
human beings giving a cold shoulder to this discrimination cling
to pleasure like birds and animals. They forget that enjoyment
| of pleasure is not the goal of human life, but its supreme object
| is the attainment of perfection, and all the circumstances, whether
favourable or unfavourable, they are placed in, are means to
attain perfection (God-realization). So they cannot have the sole
desire for God-realization.

The fact is that worldly pleasures and objects are not a real
obstacles to God-realization, but attachment to these, is the main
hindrance. So long as, this attachment continues, not to talk of
God-realization the people cannot even make up their minds to
attain God, because their minds are drawn away, by worldly
pleasure and prosperity etc. :

Appendix—If there is any obstacle to the attainment of
salvation, it is the desire for pleasures and prosperity (accumulation
of wealth). As an ensnared fish can’t move ahead, similarly a
man, entangled in pleasures and prosperity, can’t move ahead
towards God. Not only this but the man attached to pleasures
and prosperity, can’t even have the determinate intellect to
realize God.

He who regards the world as true, to him Karmayoga will
quickly lead to Self-realization. A Karmayogi serves the world

| by discharging his duty viz., he does every action for the welfare
of others in a disinterested manner. He feels happy with the
happiness of others and is sad (moved) with the sadness of others.
By feeling happy seeing others happy, his desire for pleasure is
wiped out and by being moved at the sufferings of others, his
desire for prosperity (accumulation) is wiped out.*

the desire for pleasure and prosperity otherwise the service is fake. But if the

O Arjuna, the Vedas deal with the three Gunas (attributes)
and their evolutes. Be free from those attributes, rise above the
polarity of opposites, remain balanced, be unconcerned about the
meeting of wants and preservation, of what has been already
attained and get established in the self. 45 , |
Comment:— |

'Traigunyavisaya veda—Here, the reference, is to the ritualistic
portions of the Vedas, which deal with the three gunas (attributes)
and their evolutes, in the form of worldly and heavenly enjoyment.
The purpose is not to censure the Vedas, but to glorify the selfless
spirit. In reference to a diamond a piece of glass is compared
the aim is to eulogize the diamond, rather than to censure glass.
The Vedas do not only deal with means to satisfy desires of
the worldly minded people, but they also contain sublime and
elevating ideas on God and the means to realize Him.

'Nistraigunyo bhavarjuna’—-O Arjuna, be free from the
evolutes of these attributes viz., be free from worldly enjoyment, :
as well as, means of attaining such enjoyment.

‘Nirdvandvah'—For a striver to transcend the worldly
enjoyment, it is inevitable to be free from the pairs of
opposites such as attachment and aversion etc., because these
"
217,"174 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
are his real enemies and are the stumbling block, in his
spiritual progress (Gita 3/34).* . | |

Here, Lord Krsna orders Arjuna to rise above the pairs of
opposites, because through their deluding nature, human beings are
enveloped in utter ignorance (Gita 7/27). When a striver gets rid of

- this delusion, he can worship Him with a firm resolve (Gita 7/28).
By transcending these pairs of opposites, he is easily freed from
bondage (5/3), one becomes undeluded (15/5) and he is not bound
(4/22). So the Lord, wants him to be free from the pairs of opposites.

Another aspect is that if a person develops attachment for
one person or a thing, he is sure to develop aversion to other
persons or things. By having such attachment to the world, an
aspirant turns indifferent to God. This indifference is a sort of
aversion to God. But if one develops. true devotion to God,
without having any attachment or aversion to the world, he
develops total disinclination for it. .

This total disinclination has three stages. In the first stage,
the aspirant has no hatred for unfavourable circumstances but
there is 'Upeksa (neglect), in the second stage, there is 'Udasinata’ _
(unconcernedness), while in the third stage, there is total
disinclination. In the last stage, (total disinclination), attachment
and aversion, are totally. wiped out. If this process is considered
minutely, we find that in 'Upeksa’ there remain impressions of
attachment and aversion, in 'Udasinata' the feelings of attachment
and aversion remain, while in total disinclination there are neither

impressions nor feelings of attachment and aversion. In this state,
_ attachment and aversion are totally wiped out.
'Nityasattvasthah'—The advice is to rise above the pairs
of opposites and to get established in the omnipresent and
everlasting God. , :
- ¥* 'Dyandva' means having opposite feelings for something as the feelings
of attachment-and aversion, pleasure and pain etc., for the world. This misleads
an aspirant to bondage.
"
218,"Verse 46] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 175

'Niryogaksema*'—Do not have the desire even for the provision
of the means required (Yoga) and the preservation of what has
already been attained, because I provide for and preserve all
for those who have exclusive devotion for meT (Gita 9/22).

'‘Atmavan'—Having the aim of God-realization, get
established in the self (Eternal existence or God).

Appendix—‘Nirdvandvah’—In fact the discrimination between
the insentient-sentient, real-unreal, eternal-transitory, perishable-
imperishable etc., is also a pair of opposites. The desire for gain
and security is also a duality. Because of duality “All is God’—this
reality is not realized. The reason is when all is God, then how
can duality between the sentient (self) and the insentient (Matter)
subsist? Therefore the Lord has declared Himself both immortality
as well as death, and ‘Sat’ as well as “Asat’ (unreal)}—‘amrtarh
caiva mrtyusca sadasaccahamarjuna’ (Gita 9/19).

_ { Though here it is the context of the Discipline of Disinterested Action, yet
it seems proper to take it as the Discipline of Devotion because Lord Krsna, time
and again, orders Arjuna to be His devotee and He also accepts him as His devotee
in 4/3. He also takes the responsibility of provision and protection (9/22).
"
219,"176 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter2
Comment:— | . .

'Yavanartha udapane sarvatah samplutodake'—A . small
reservoir of water is useful, in a place where there is no other
source of water. But nobody ever, pays any attention to such a
reservoir of water where there is a big reservoir of pure water.
Moreover that such a small reservoir of water becomes dirty and
impure and cannot be used for drinking purpose, after washing
and bathing in it. But water from a large stream remains clean
and pure, even after washing and bathing in it.

'Tavansarvesu. vedesu. brahmanasya  vijanatah'—Likewise
oblations, charities, penances and pilgrimages etc., mentioned in

| the Vedas, are of use to those who are ignorant. But these become
meaningless to the illumined souls who have realized God. The
: same kind of comparison has been made, in the seventieth verse,
that the emancipated souls are like sea, as several rivers fall into
it but its magnitude remains the same, similarly the illumined
souls remain undisturbed though several kinds of pleasure and
enjoyment merge into them.

A great soul who possesses knowledge of the Lord, the Vedas
and the scriptures is called 'Brahmanasya vijanatah.'

By using the term 'tavan', Lord Krsna means to say that
the great soul after realizing God transcends the three attributes
(modes), rises above the pairs of opposites viz., becomes free
from attachment and aversion, gets established in the self and
remains unconcerned about provision and preservation. He always
remains devoted to God.

Appendix—There is no end of worldly pleasures. There are
endless universes and there are endless pleasures in them. But if
they are renounced and one becomes detached from them, they
come to an end. Similarly there are endless desires. But if they are
renounced, they come to an end and the man becomes desireless.

Your right is only to perform your duty, but never to claim :
its fruit. Do not be the cause of the fruit of action nor let your
attachment be for inaction. 47 7
Comment:— : :

'Karmanyevadhikaraste'—Your right is to perform your
duty, you are free in it, because no other bodies as those of
animals and birds etc., are free to perform new actions. Only
human beings are eligible to perform new actions. The gods can
perform new actions and can bestow money and material upon
human beings, according to the ordinance of the Lord but they
are so steeped in enjoyment, that it is not possible for them to
perform new actions. They are destined only to reap the fruit
of their meritorious deeds. The creatures in hell also cannot
perform new actions as they suffer the fruits of their actions.
God has bestowed this human birth, the very last of all births
so that by performing new actions in the form of selfless service
to others, a person may achieve salvation and be freed from the
bondage of the cycle of birth and death. If he remains engaged
in selfish actions, these will result in bondage. In case he is
given to indolence and heedlessness, he will follow a cycle of
birth and death. Therefore, the Lord advises human beings, to |
render selfless services for common good.

The term 'Karmani' has been used ‘in singular number, to
emphasize the fact that though man has to perform several
"
221,"178 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
duties in his life, he can perform only: one at a particular time.
Arjuna, belonging to the warrior class, has several duties, such
as fighting, generosity and bravery etc., but presently he could
perform only one of these—to wage the war. |
In the births of others 1.e., those of birds, animals, insects
and even gods, the creatures can reap the fruits of their actions
but cannot perform new actions. However there are two things
about human life viz., reaping the fruits of deeds of earlier
lives, and secondly performing new ones. God has bestowed
upon man this human body, so that by performing new virtuous
actions without having a desire for their fruits, he may attain
God-realization or salvation. As far as the fruit of his previous
actions is concemed, it may come in the form of favourable
and unfavourable circumstances. He cannot change those
circumstances, but can make proper use of these and these can
lead him to salvation, if he uses these properly.
An important fact, which needs attention, is that favourable
: or unfavourable circumstances cannot make a man happy or sad.
It is merely his ignorance, which makes him happy or sad as
he identifies himself with those circumstances and becomes the
experiencer of happiness or sadness. If he gives a serious thought,
he will come to know that the external circumstances cannot make
his internal self, either happy or sad. He should make proper
use of the favourable circumstances by serving others and of the
undesirable ones, by renouncing the desire to enjoy pleasure.
In unfavourable circumstances, a man should not be perturbed
but should think that the sins committed to get pleasure, are
perishing in the form of unfavourable circumstances and this thought
is a kind of repentance for the sins committed. Secondly, it is a
fore-warning to us that we shall have to face adverse consequences
if we commit sins again. So, we should perform actions for
"
222,"Verse 47] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 179
the welfare of all creatures, rather than for our own pleasure. |

For insects, birds and animals etc., the fruit of past actions
and also the present actions are only to work out their destinies.
But in case of human beings the fruit of past actions as aiso the
present activities, are the means for their salvation.

""Ma phalesu kadacana'—You cannot claim the fruit of action, —
because you are not free in getting it, which is dispensed by the
Lord. If you perform actions with a desire for fruits, you will
get into bondage (Gita 5/12). It is the desire for fruit which
makes a person an agent for actions. With the passing away of
desire, a sense of doership is gone. Obliteration of the sense of

: doership, does not lead a man to’ bondage. It means that a man
is much more entangled in desires.* : Oo

Secondly, all actions are performed with the help of worldly
objects and persons. So it is dishonest, to desire the fruit of those
actions, for only one's own self. : | | |

The desire for fruit of actions is not beneficial for human
beings. ‘Never lay claim to its fruit'—this expression proves that
it is upto a man whether he lays claim to the fruit of an action
or not. He is free in this respect. The term ‘Phalesu' has been
used in the plural, because a man by performing an action desires
several fruits such as riches, respect and reputation etc. —

The means to be free, from the desire for fruits of actions are
as follows—(i) Desire causes a feeling of lacking something. Its
fulfilment makes one a slave. Its non-fulfilment causes suffering.
The pleasure derived out of fulfilment of desire, gives birth to
new desires and a man goes on getting interested in performing
new actions, in order to reap their fruit. By understanding this
fact in the right perspective, a man becomes free from the desire
for the fruit of action. — oS

_* Actually God-realization does not depend on actions but on feelings and _
knowledge because He is ever attained. It 1s the desire for fruits which is an
obstacle to God-realization.
"
223,"180 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2

(ii) Actions have a beginning and an end, these are not
eternal. So, how can their fruits be eternal? But the self is eternal.
How can the eternal get any benefit from the perishable? By
understanding this fact, one becomes detached from the world
and attains God-realization. :

In order to be free from the desire for fruits of actions, an
aspirant should have discrimination as well as feelings to serve
others. Discrimination will be helpful to an aspirant in renouncing
his comforts, while the feelings of service to others, will enable
him to do good to others. By doing so a striver can follow the
Discipline of Disinterested Action, in the right sense.

""Ma karmaphalaheturbhih'—Let you not be responsible for

| the fruits of action. It means, that you should not have the least
attachment for the body, senses, mind and intellect etc., because
attachment for these will make you responsible for the fruit of
action. In the eleventh verse of the fifth chapter also, Lord Krsna
by using the term ‘Kevalaih’ (only) wants to say that the follower
of the Discipline of Disinterested Action, should abandon feeling
of mineness for the body, mind, intellect and senses.

If a striver becomes the agent (doer) of a virtuous action,
even without having a desire for its fruit, he is held responsible
for the fruit of the action, because by doing so he has accepted
his affinity for the mind, intellect and senses etc., which are
unreal. Actually, we have no affinity with them, they have their
affinity with the world. When anybody else performs action for
the good of others, we do not accept our affinity for the action
and its fruit and so are not held responsible. We should adopt
the same attitude in the case of our own actions also, so that we
may not be held responsible for the fruit of actions.

'Ma te sango'stvakarmani'—Let your attachment not be to
inaction, because by leaning towards inaction, you will become
lazy and idle, and like the desire for fruit it will also mislead you
to bondage. The reason is that, indolence and prolonged sleep
"
224,"Verse 47] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 181
etc., also give pleasure viz., Tamasika joy, (Gital8/39) which
misleads either to the lower births of insects, birds and beasts
etc., or to infernal regions (Gita 14/18). It means that, attachment
misleads to bondage and is the cause of birth in good and evil
wombs (Gita 13/21).

- You should not be attached to inaction by thinking that it
will lead you to progress, here and hereafter, because the real
essence is beyond action or imaction. :

In this verse, the Lord means to say that a striver should
remain detached from objects, men, action, incidents, circumstances
and physical, subtle, causal bodies etc., without having the least

| affinity for them. | 7

In this verse there are four points which need attention—{i)
Your right is to perform your duty (action) only. (ii) Never lay
claim to its fruit. (11) Do not be the cause of the fruit of action.
(iv) Let your attachment be not to inaction. Out of these four
points, the first and the fourth, have the same theme as both
of these lay emphasis on the performance of duty or action.
Similarly, the second and the third points have the same theme,
as in both of these it is mentioned, that you should not desire
or be the cause of the fruit of action. |

It means that, by leaning towards inaction you will have
affinity to tamasika temperament, such as idleness and laziness.
By having attachment for action and its fruit you will have affinity
for rajasika temperament. But when a striver is free from laziness,
idleness, actions, fruit of actions, etc., he gets the joy born of
knowledge and light and having attachment for it, he has affinity ,
to sattvika temperament. Affinity with these is the cause of birth
and death. Therefore, a striver should not have attachment for
either of them. Doing one's duty without having any attachment
to them, is called the Discipline of Disinterested Action.

Appendix—One is the division of actions and one is the
division of fruit (result). A man’s right is in the division of
"
225,"—— 182 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
actions (performance of duty), not in the division of fruit. The
reason is that performance of duty is under the control of a
man while awarding the result of past actions ts ordained by
destiny viz., “Prarabdha’. If we perceive from the view-point
of Karmayoga whatever material (thing, ability and power) we
have obtained, that is ‘Prarabdha’ and their proper use viz., by
assuming them not as ours or for us, but by assuming them as
others’ and for them, and rendering service with them to others
is ‘Purusartha’. |

The important fact about Karmayoga is—protection of the
rights of others by performing one’s duty and renouncing the
fruit of action viz., renouncing one’s right. By protecting the
right of others, old attachment is wiped out and by renouncing
one’s own right, new attachment is not born. Thus when old
attachment is wiped out and new attachment is not born, a man
becomes ‘vitaraga’ (free from attachment). By becoming ‘vitaraga’
one realizes the self. The reason is in attaining Self-realization,
attachment to the unreal things is the only obstacle—

rago lmgamabodhasya cittavyayama bhimisu |
kutah Sadvalata tasya yasyagnih kotare tarah

It means that attachment (attraction) of the mind to objects,
persons and actions is the main sign (mark) of ignorance. As
when the hollow of a tree catches fire, it does not remain green

| any more but it is dried up, similarly he who has caught fire in
the form of attachment, can’t attain peace.

Comment:—
‘Sangam tyaktva'—You can become indifferent, only if you :

have no attachment for actions, their fruits; place, time, incidents, |

circumstances, bodies and minds etc., which belong to matter, _
because without being indifferent to actions, these cannot lead }
you to salvation. :

'Siddhyasiddhyoh samo bhiitva'—Renunciation of attachment |
will result in evenness of mind. A man should be even-minded,

in favourable and unfavourable circumstances, in honour and |

dishonour, and in praise and reproach.* -
A follower of the Discipline of Disinterested Action, should be

so even-minded while performing actions, that he should not bother

about their accomplishment or non-accomplishment, for getting

the fruit or not, for getting salvation or not. He should remain

devoted to his duty. If an aspirant has not realized detachment

and equanimity, he should aim at evenness of mind. By having

this approach, a striver will attain equanimity finally, which will

lead to God-realization or Self-realization (2/53).

""Yogasthah kuru karmani'—Lord Krsna says, that the essence

of true Yoga lies in even-mindedness, in success, as well as,

failure. The person who keeps the mind ever in the poised state
* While explaining this verse Sri Sankaracarya writes—O Dhanajijaya,

being established in Yoga perform actions only for God without even having the

desire to please Him. Knowledge gained by purification of mind as a result of

the desireless (without the desire for fruits) actions is called 'Siddhi’ (Success) |

and whatever is contrary to it (lack of knowledge) is ‘Asiddhi’ (Failure). Perform

actions being even-minded amidst success or failure. This evenness of mind or

equanimity is called ""Yoga’. ,
"
227,"184 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
is called steadfast in Yoga- The sameness of mind should remain
intact from the beginning of an action, to its end. It should not
be. a temporary phase, otherwise the propensities of attraction
and repulsion, will go on coming up. We should never allow
such propensities to develop.

‘Samatvarh yoga ucyate'—Yoga is, nothing but equanimity
Le., equanimity is the embodiment of Lord Himself. Further,
in the nineteenth verse of the fifth chapter, Lord Krsna says,
*“Those whose mind is established in equanimity, have conquered
the mortal plane, because Brahma (the Absolute) is flawless and
equanimous, hence they are established in the Eternal.” «5

| Here, Yoga has been defined as equanimity, while in the
twenty-third verse of the sixth chapter, it will be defined as,
the state which is free from the contact of pain. Actually, both
the definitions are the same. When a man suffers from ring-
worm or itching eczema, he gets satisfaction by scratching it.
The pleasure of itching, is followed by the painful sensation of
burning. Being the result of a disease both these sensations are
really painful. Similarly, the pleasure and pain received from
attachment to the world, are equally painful. Therefore, Yoga
can either be defined as the state, free from the contact of pain
viz., free from pleasure and pain or equanimity in pleasure and
pain; both are the same. 7
_ Jt means that through all actions performed by physical, subtle
and causal bodies should render service to the world, without
having any selfish motive. This alone will lead to equanimity.

Intellect is of two kinds—indeterminate and determinate.
The intellect of those whose aim is to enjoy worldly pleasure
and prosperity, is indeterminate (Gita 2/44) while the intellect
of those whose aim is equanimity and salvation is determinate.
Indeterminate intellects are endlessly diverse, while the determinate
"
228,"Verse 48] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 185
one, is single. Those whose intellects are endlessly diverse, are
themselves undecided (Gita 2/41) and are worldly. But those
whose intellect is single, have rightly resolved (Gita 9/30) and
they are strivers.

Equanimity is of two kinds—of the mind and of the self.
To remain even, in favourable or unfavourable circumstances,
without having any attachment or aversion, is equanimity of the
mind, while equanimity of the self is union with God (2/53).

There is a distinction between the worldly people and
strivers. The goal of the worldly people, is to enjoy pleasure
and prosperity and their intellects are not determinate but are

| scattered in many directions and are endlessly diverse. On the

other hand, the striver's intellects are determinate and the strivers
in their practical life maintain equanimity in success and failure, :
profit and loss, and favourable and unfavourable circumstances,
without having attachment and aversion. Such strivers conquer
the mortal plane and are established in the Eternal (Gita 5/19).

Appendix—In Patanjala Yogadarsana the control of the
mind has been called ‘yoga’—‘yogascittavrtti nirodhah’ (1/2).
As a result of this yoga the seer rests in the self—‘tada drastuh

what has been called the result of yoga, the Gita declares
the same as ‘yoga’—‘samatvarh yoga ucyate’; ‘tarh vidyad
duhkhasarhyogaviyogam yogasamjnitam’ (Gita 6/23). It means
that the Gita declares that when a man (self) is totally detached
from the mind and naturally rests in the self, that state is called
‘yoga’. By getting established in this yoga (equanimity), there
is no deviation from it; therefore it is also called ‘Nityayoga’
(eternal union). When the mind is controlled ‘Nirvikalpa avastha’
(state of cessation of thoughts) ensues. But when by equanimity
a man rests in the Self that 1s ‘Nirvikalpa bodha’ (knowledge of
Truth) or ‘sahajavastha’ (Self-realization). ‘Nirvikalpa bodha’ is
not a state but it transcends all states, it is their illuminator and is
"
229,"186 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter2
the result of all yoga-disciplines. The states are both ‘nirvikalpa’
: (without distraction) and ‘savikalpa’ (with distraction) but “bodha’
| is only ‘nirvikalpa’. Thus the yoga of the Gita is more remarkable

| than that of Patafijala yogadarSana.
The person who is not of ‘midha’ (deluded) and ‘ksipta’
/ (volatile) inclination but is of ‘viksipta’ (sometimes constant,
7 sometimes volatile) inclination is eligible (qualified) for yoga of
Pataiijala Yogadarsana. But all the persons who want to attain
| God are eligible for the yoga of the Gita (God-realization). Not
- only this but the person who, instead of attaching importance to
| pleasure and prosperity, attaches importance to this yoga—such
- a seeker of the yoga (equanimity) also transcends the fruit of
Vedic rituals performed with some motive—‘jijfasurapi yogasya

| §abdabrahmativartate’ (Gita 6/44).

_ * Link:— In the next verse, Lord Krsna explains the superiority
of equanimity (which has been described from the thirty-ninth
verse to the forty-eighth verse) to a motivated action viz., action
with a selfish motive.

Comment:—
'Direna hyavaram karma buddhiyogat—Action with a selfish
motive is, far inferior to that performed with equanimity of
mind. Actions have a beginning and an end and connection with
"
230,"Verse 49] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 187
their fruits, is also temporary. We get associated and dissociated
with them. But Yoga (equanimity) is eternal, it never deserts us,
it suffers no change. Therefore, selfish action is much inferior
to equanimity.

Action without equanimity, mislead to pain, as well as to the
cycle of birth and death, because they have no power to lead one
to salvation. Equanimity is the ability to neutralize actions. If there
is nO equanimity, one will develop one's egoism and attachment,
to the body. This egoism and attachment are beastly. In the
Bhagavata sage Sukadeva says to king Pariksit, 'O king, renounce
this beastly nature which is causing fear of death in you’ (12/5/2).

: 'Diirena'—As light is the contrary of darkness, an action
performed with equanimity of mind, is contrary to the action
performed with a selfish motive. An action performed with
equanimity leads to God-realization, while motivated actions
mislead to the wheel of birth and death. :

‘Buddhau Saranamanviccha'— Seek refuge in this evenness
of mind viz., remain established in this evenness of mind, which
will enable you to realize yourself. oo

'Krpanah phalahetavah'—It is very lowly to crave for fruit
of action. To accept one's affinity for actions, fmiits of actions
and bodies etc., means, to crave for fruit of action. Therefore,
Lord Krsna, in the forty-seventh verse, exhorts Arjuna not to
have the fruit of action, as his object. |

The eternal truth is different from perishable action and the
fruit of action. What can be more ignoble than this, that the
eternal should be subservient to the perishable fruit of action?

Appendix—An action with a selfish motive is far inferior
to yoga (equanimity) viz., it does not lead to salvation. As a
molecule is far smaller than a mountain viz., a molecule can’t
be compared with a mountain, similarly an action with a selfish
motive is far inferior to yoga viz., an action can’t be compared
with yoga. Yoga (equanimity) is skill in action—‘yogah karmasu
"
231,"188 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2

- kauSalam’ (Gita 2/50). Therefore without yoga, an action is of
a very low order, is worthless and is an obstacle—‘karmana
badhyate jantuh’. .

In Karmayoga ‘Karma’ is Karana Sapeksa (dependent on
external and internal organs) but ‘yoga’ is Karana Nirapeksa
(independent of external and internal organs). Yoga is not
attained by actions but is attained by service and renunciation.
Therefore Karmayoga is not Karma (action). Karmayoga is
Karana Nirapeksa viz., discrimination predominating discipline.
If there 1s no predominance of service and renunciation, it will
be Karma, not Karmayoga (Discipline of Action) at all.
~ - Kquanimity leads to God-realization, but actions done with an
interested motive lead to-the cycle of birth and death. Therefore

| a striver should depend on equanimity, should remain established
in equanimity. By being established in equanimity, he will not
remain destitute and nothing will remain to be done, to be known
and to be attained by him. But he, who works with an interested
motive (for him), ever remains destitute and bound.

In the Gita three terms have been used for Karmayoga—Buddhi,
yoga and Buddhiyoga. In Karmayoga, there is no predominance
of action (Karma) but there is predominance of ‘yoga’. Yoga,
Buddhi and Buddhiyoga—the three are synonyms. In Karmayoga
because of the predominance of determinate intellect, it is called
‘Buddhi’ and because of the predominance 6f renunciation by
discrimination, it is called ‘yoga’ or ‘buddhiyoga’. |

In ‘Dhyanayoga’ (Discipline of Meditation) there is
predominance of concentration of ‘mind’, while in Karmayoga
there is predominance of ‘intellect’. While tryng to control the
mind, serenity and fickleness linger for a long time because in It
a striver wants to withdraw the mind from the world and wants
to concentrate it on God. While withdrawing the mind from
the world, in its conception the existence of the world persists.
This is a rule that so long as there is assumption of any other
"
232,"Verse 50] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 189
entity except God, the mind can’t be fully controlled. Therefore
upto the stage of trance also there are two states—trance and
deviation from trance (relapse). But in Karmayoga because of the
predominance of intellect, there is prominence of discrimination.
While applying discrimination both the real and the unreal remain.
A karmayogi applies the unreal things for the service of others
by regarding those things as the material for the service. By
such conception the attachment for the unreal is quickly and
easily renounced. _

The mind is not continuously concentrated but it is concentrated
at times and in loneliness. But determinate intellect viz., a single
pointed determination of the intellect always remains steadfast.

equanimity of mind.

buddhiyukto jahatiha $oubhe — sukrtaduskrte

tasmadyogaya yujyasva yogah karmasu kauSalam

Endowed with equanimity, one frees the self in this life from
good (virtue) and evil (vice) alike; therefore, devote yourself to
this Yoga of equanimity; skill in action lies in (the practice of
this) Yoga. 50
Comment:— — |

""Buddhiyukto jahattha ubhe sukrtaduskrte'—A person,
endowed with equanimity, becomes free from virtue and vice 7
like omnipresent God (Gita 2/38).

In the state of equanimity, a man while living in the world
detaches himself from the world, and remains untouched by
virtues and sins, as a lotus leaf by water.

Man himself is sentient and is free from virtue and sin,
"
233,"190 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
but by identifying himself with the unreal body etc., sins and

_ virtues accrue. If he does not identify himself with the unreal,
he will remain untouched by virtues and sins, and unconnected
with them like the sky. | :

'Tasmadyogaya yujyasva'—Therefore, devote yourself to the
Yoga of. equanimity, viz., remain established continuously in
equanimity. You cannot attain that equanimity, so long as you
have attachment and aversion. You are the knower of pleasure and
pain. It means, that you are different from them and you are as
a onlooker, who remains equanimous. So realize that equanimity.

""Yogah karmasu kausalam'—Skill in action lies in the

| practice of this Yoga. Equanimity, in success and failure, is
_ skill in action.

In this verse, Lord Krsna has not defined Yoga, but He has
explained the importance of Yoga. (equanimity). If we interpret
it as, 'skill in action is Yoga’, it means, that the action of a thief
carried out skilfully, will also be called Yoga. Therefore, this
interpretation does not seem proper. Some people may define
Yoga ‘skill in action approved by the scriptures.’ But, by doing
so the people will be bound by the fruits of action and will not
be able to attain equanimity. Therefore, it is proper to interpret,
equanimity in action as skill or wisdom. The reason is, that he
who remains even-minded while performing actions, is not bound
by such actions and their fruit.

Secondly, in the first part of this verse, as well as in the
previous two verses there is the reference of Yoga (Equanimity) __
rather than skill. So this interpretation seems to be reasonable.

Appendix—lIf we reflect upon the expression ‘yogah karmasu
kauSalam’, it may have two meanings—

(i) ‘karmasu kaugalam yogah’—skill in actions is yoga.

(ii) ‘karmasu yogah kausalam’—In action yoga is skill.

| If we interpret it in the first way that skill in actions is
"
234,"Verse 50] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 191
yoga, then the actions of a thief or a swindler carried out very
skilfully, will be called “Yoga’. This interpretation is not proper
and moreover here is not the topic of forbidden actions. If we
regard only virtuous actions to be carried out skilfully as ‘Yoga’,
then the man will be bound being attached to the fruit of those
virtuous actions—‘phale sakto nibadhyate’ (Gita 5/12). Therefore
he will not attain equanimity and his sufferings will not perish.

In the scriptures it is menttoned——‘karmana badhyate jantuh’
v1Z., a man is bound by actions. Therefore the actions which
naturally lead him to bondage, may lead him to salvation—this
is indeed skill in actions. Salvation is attained by ‘yoga’
(equanimity), rather than by skill in actions. Yoga (equanimity)
has neither its beginning nor end. But even the most virtuous
actions begin and end and there is union and disunion of their
fruit also. How will a person attain salvation by what begins
and ends and of which there is union and disunion? How will
the imperishable be attained by the perishable? Equanimity is
the form of God—‘nirdosarh hi samarh brahma’ (Gitd 5/19).
Therefore ‘yoga’ is important, not actions.

If the first interpretation is regarded as correct, even then
within ‘skill’, equanimity or feeling of disinterest will have
to be accepted. If skill in actions is yoga, then what is skill?
While answering this question we’ ll have to say that only ‘Yoga’
(equanimity) is skill. In such a situation why should we not
accept the direct meaning that yoga (equanimity) in actions is
skill. When in the expression ‘yogah karmasu kaugalam’ the
term ‘yoga’ has certainly been used, then there is no need of
interpreting the word ‘KuSalata’ (skill) as yoga.

If we reflect upon this topic, there is the reference of ‘Yoga’
(equanimity) rather than ‘skill in actions’. The Lord by declaring
‘samatvarh yoga ucyate’ has also defined ‘yoga’. Therefore in
this reference ‘yoga’ is ‘vidheya’ (predicate), ‘skill in actions’ is
not predicate. ‘Yoga’ (equanimity) is skill in action viz., while
"
235,"192 _ SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
doing actions there should be even-mindedness, there should not
be any attachment or aversion—this is skill in actions. Therefore
‘yogah karmasu kauSalarn’—this is not the definition of Yoga,
but it is the glory of ‘Yoga’.

In the first half of this verse (fiftieth) the Lord has declared
that a person endowed with equanimity becomes free from virtue
and vice (sin). If he is freed from virtue and sin, then which
action will be done with skill? Therefore freedom from virtue
and sin does not mean that he does not do any action because
no one under any circumstances can remain even for a moment
without undertaking action (Gita 3/5). So here freedom from

| virtue and sin means—freedom from their fruit. In the fifty-first
verse also the Lord has mentioned the renunciation of the fruit
of action by the expression ‘phalarh tyaktva’.

In the Gita the term ‘KuSala’ has also been used in the tenth
verse of the eighteenth chapter. There within ‘akugala karma’
all the actions performed with an interested motive and actions
forbidden by the scriptures, have been included while within
‘kuSala karma’ all the actions done with disinterested motive and
actions sanctioned by the scriptures, have been included. There
is a beginning and there is an end of ‘Akugala’ and ‘Kuéala’
actions but there is no beginning or end of ‘Yoga’. Attachment
and aversion bind a man; agreeable and disagreeable actions
don’t bind him. Therefore the actions, which are performed
by being attached to them, may be very virtuous, will lead to
bondage because by those actions even if the abode of Brahma
is attained, one has to return (Gita 8/16). Therefore the. man,
who does not shun the disagreeable actions with aversion and
does not perform the virtuous actions with attachment, is indeed
a man of true renunciation, is intelligent, is free from doubts and
is established in the self (Gita 18/10). , :

The above description proves that the expression ‘yogah
karmasu kauSsalam’ means ‘Yoga (equanimity) in actions
"
236,"Verse 51] - SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 193
is skill’—this should be accepted. The Lord also orders to
perform actions being steadfast in Yoga—‘yogasthah kuru
karmani’ (Gita 2/48). It means that actions are not significant
but ‘Yoga’ (equanimity) is significant. Therefore only ‘Yoga’
(equanimity) in actions is skill.

karmajam buddhiyukta hi phalam tyaktva manisinah
janmabandhavinirmuktah padam gacchantyanamayam

As wise men endowed with equanimity, renounce the fruits of
actions, they also freed from the shackles of births and attain the
blissful supreme state. 51
Comment:—

'Karmajam buddhiyukté hi phalarn tyaktva manisinah'—
Those endowed with equanimity, are really wise. In the tenth
verse of the eighteenth chapter also, it is explained that, the
man who does not hate disagreeable action nor is attached to
an agreeable one, is wise. | | —

An action even without the desire for its fruit will. bring
about fruit. No one can dispense with its fruit. Suppose a farmer
sows seed without a selfish motive, will he not get corn? He
will definitely get corn. In the same way if a person works in
a detached spirit, he will get its fruit. Therefore, renunciation :
of fruit means, renunciation of manifest and latent desires for
fruit and attachment for fruit. All people are free and capable
of renouncing such desires. |

‘Janmabandhavinirmuktah'—The wise aspirants, endowed
with equanimity of mind are freed from the wheel of birth and
"
237,"194 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
death. As in the state of equanimity, they do not in the least,
possess evils, such as attachment and aversion etc., which are the
root cause of rebirth. Thus they become free from the shackles
of birth and death, forever.

‘Padarn gacchantyanamayam'—'Amaya’ means ailment. An
ailment is a blemish. A thing which is free from all sorts of
blemishes is called ‘Anamaya (spotless). Wise people endowed
with equanimity attain the state, which is free from any kind
of blemish. This state has been called eternal state, in the fifth
verse of the fifteenth chapter and ‘everlasting imperishable state’,
in the fifty-sixth verse of the eighteenth chapter.

Though in the Gita (in 14/6) sattva quality (the mode of
goodness) has also been called flawless, yet in fact, the self or
God is flawless because by attaining Him one has not to follow the
wheel of birth and death. Lord Krsna has called Sattva quality also
flawless, because that also helps a man in attaining God-realization.

Self (soul) is immutable while the evolutes of matter
(nature)—body and the world are mutable. When this self
(soul) identifies itself with the mutable body, it itself assumes
taint with mutable nature. But, when it renounces this assumed
identification, it realizes its pure self. This is a blissful supreme
state, free from evil.

In this verse the terms ‘buddhiyukta’ and ‘manisinah’ have
been used in the plural, to express the idea that all those who get
established in equanimity undoubtedly attain the blissful supreme
state, without any exception. It proves. that when a striver has
no affinity to the perishable body and the world, he attains that
state automatically. No effort is required for such a state to be
created, as it always is there. : |

Appendix—Why Yoga (equanimity) in actions is skill—the
Lord explains its reason in this verse by the term ‘hi’ (reason).

The fruit of ‘Sattvika’ (good) actions is pure, the fruit
of ‘Rajasa’ action is pain and the fruit of “Tamasa’ action is
"
238,"Verse 52] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI ' 195
ignorance (Gita 14/16)—a man with equanimity transcends these
three kinds of fruit. The renunciation of the fruit of actions has
two meanings—renouncing the desire for fruit; and not to feel
happy and sad in favourable and unfavourable circumstances
which are the fruits of actions. |
In fact the entire world which is born and perishes is nothing
but the fruit of actions. If the fruit of actions is renounced, no
bondage remains. | | |
The term ‘manisi’ means wise men. According to the preceding
verse performance of actions with equanimity is wisdom—‘sa
buddhimanmanusyesu’ (Gita 4/18).
| ‘Padam gacchantyanamayam’—The term ‘gacchanti’ has
three meanings—(1) To have knowledge, (2) to go, (3) to attain.
Here attainment of the blissful supreme state means—to have
knowledge of being free from the shackles of birth and death
and of the attainment of the natural state, free from all sorts of
blemishes. The reason is that only that is renounced which is
in fact ever renounced and only that is attained who is in fact
ever attained. : |
| This verse proves that ‘Karmayoga’ (Discipline of Action)
is an independent means for salvation or benediction. By
‘Karmayoga’ the renunciation of the world and attainment of
God—both ensue. ,

When your intellect crosses the mire of delusion, you will then
"
239,"196 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
acquire indifference, to what has been heard and what is yet to be
heard, (about enjoyments of this world and the next). 52
Comment:—

'Yada te mohakalilam buddhirvyatitarisyati'—The state
which favours, egoism in this body and attachment for the
body, family, kinsmen and objects, is called delusion. Actually,
there is no egoism and attachment, for the body etc. They are
merely assumed. Pleasure and displeasure, in favourable and
unfavourable circumstances and evils, such as partiality, hatred,
envy and jealousy etc., are a quagmire. When the intellect of a
man gets entangled in this mire of delusion, he is perplexed and
cannot think properly.

| He, himself is sentient, but by accepting his affinity for the
insentient body and things etc., he identifies himself with them.
Thus by closing his eyes to the real goal, he~gets engrossed in
worldly pleasure and prosperity. This is called, entanglement
in the mire of delusion. But the intellect which takes the firm
decision to be free from the worldly pleasures and prosperity
and to attain salvation, is called the ‘Intellect’ transcending the
mire of delusion.

There are two means to cross the swamp of delusion—
discrimination (2/11—30) and selfless service. Acute discrimination
between the real and the unreal, makes one indifferent to the unreal
world, and a keen desire for selfless service for the welfare of
others, enables one to renounce the desire for one's own pleasures.
In the same way as when a disciple for his preceptor, a son for
parents, a servant for his master develop a wish for providing
all sorts of comforts to them, then their desire for comfort goes
away automatically.

The Discipline of Knowledge, is somewhat difficult to
practise, because the desire for pleasure may linger on in it. When
a striver comes across pleasures, he deviates from his spiritual
path and inclines towards them. But a striver who has the feeling
"
240,"Verse 53] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 197
for service to others, utilizes the material for the service of others,
and thus his desire for pleasures perishes easily. Therefore, Lord
Krsna has mentioned the Discipline of Disinterested Action, as
superior to and easier than the Discipline of Knowledge (5/2-3)
and by it a striver quickly reaches Brahma—the Absolute (5/6).

'Tada gantasi nirvedarh Srotavyasya Srutasya ca'—The pleasure
which men have enjoyed and heard* of and also the pleasures of
heaven etc., which are yet to be heard of, are transient. So, how
can they give peace and joy to the man's self which is permanent?
Thus men become dispassionate. When intellect gets out of the
mire of delusion, then acute discrimination is developed that the

| world is ephemeral while he (the self) is eternal and therefore,
how could the kaleidoscopic world provide peace to him? With
this attitude of mind, he automatically develops detachment,
from the whole wogd.

Lord Krsna has used the term ‘hear’ instead of ‘enjoy’ because
there is attraction for pleasure after hearing about it. Thus ‘hearing’
is an important factor for the attraction of pleasures. Hearing
as a means occupies an important place in the Disciplines of
Knowledge and Devotion for spiritual progress also.

The terms ‘yada’ (when) and ‘tada’ (then) have been used
to emphasize the fact, that there is no rule that it will take so
many years or months or days, to develop this acute dispassion.
As soon as, your intellect crosses the mire of delusion, you will
become dispassionate. It involves no much delay. —

After your intellect, confused by hearing conflicting doctrines,

Self-realization or union, with God. 53 | | ——
Comment:— : |
[After crossing the mire of delusion also, there may be
confusion of mind by hearing conflicting spiritual doctrines. So
Lord Krsna induces Arjuna to get rid of that confusion.]
'‘Srutivipratipanna te yada sthasyati niscala samadhavacala _
buddhistada yogamavapsyasi'—Arjuna was in a fix, whether he
should perform his duty as a Ksatriya or he should avoid the
slaughter of his kith and kin. If he protected his family, he would
shirk his duty. If he performed his duty of fighting, then the
family would not be protected. So he was bewildered.* Therefore
Lord Krsna persuades Arjuna to keep the intellect firm in case
of scriptural opinions and steady in regarding God-realization.
First of all, a striver is unable to make up his mind whether
to have honest and sincere dealings with the worldly people, or
to attain God. Then he decides that he has to render selfless
service to the world. Having taken this decision, he starts showing
indifference and dispassion to the worldly pleasures. Then in the
| spiritual path he comes across different opinions of the scriptures.
So it becomes difficult for him to decide, which opinion he
should follow. In that case by good company or faith etc., he is
either able to take the decision or he surrenders himself to God.
Then by God's grace his intellect becomes firm. Secondly, in all
the scriptures and religions, God, soul and the world, have been
described in different forms and ways. But all of them agree, ""I
am soul, not body,"" ""The world is to be ignored"", ""God 1s to
* A person may be in a dilemma in two ways—in worldly affairs and in
scriptural ordinances or sects such as dualism and non-dualism etc. It is more
difficult to be free from the dilemma of the scriptural ordinances than from that of
the worldly affairs. So Lord Krsna explains that a striver should have a determinate
intellect that he has to realize only God whatsoever may happen.
"
242,"Verse 53] | SADHAKA-SANJIVANI- 199
be realized."" By taking this decision the intellect of the striver
becomes steady. Then he realized God easily. So the only obstacle
to God-realization is lack of firmness of intellect.

The greater the deficiency in reaching at a decision regarding
the contrary spintual doctrines and in his own emancipation,
the greater the delay there is. But in both cases as soon as the
intellect becomes steady and determinate, eternal union with
God is realized. | :

The intellect should be unshakable in order to renounce
affinity for the world, as mentioned by the expression ‘state of
severance from union with pain,' in the twenty-third verse of the
sixth chapter; while it should be steady in order to have affinity
for God as expressed by the expression ‘evenness of mind is
called Yoga’, in the forty-eighth verse of the second chapter.

Here in 'tada yogamavapsyasi Yoga, means to become
established in union with God, from whom there is no disunion.
Only the striver has to abandon his affinity with the unreal. This
union can be realized either by selfless service viz., Discipline
of Disinterested Action, or discrimination viz., Discipline of
Knowledge, or love for God viz., Discipline of Devotion,
or meditation or annihilation of the world viz., Discipline of
Annihilation (Layayoga) or by the process of restraining breath
viz., Discipline of Austerity (Hathayoga) etc.

Appendix—There are two divisions of delusion—‘mohakalila’
viz., the worldly delusion and ‘Srutivipratipatti’—scriptural
(philosophical) delusion. Attachment to the body, wife, sons,
wealth, property etc., 1s ‘worldly delusion’ and ‘Dvaita’
(dualism ), ‘Advaita’ (non-dualism), ‘Visistadvaita’ (qualified
dualism) and  ‘dvaitadvaita’ (dualism-non-dualism)—to get
entangled in these ‘isms’ is ‘scriptural delusion’. By renouncing
these two types of delusion, a man gets detached from pleasures
and his intellect becomes stable. When the intellect becomes
stable, “Yoga’ is attained viz., the distance from God comes
"
243,"200 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter2
to an end and you come near to God. By ‘Karmayoga’ you
come near God, by ‘Jnanayoga’ difference is wiped out and
there is ‘Abheda’ and by ‘Bhaktiyoga’ there is ‘abhinnata’ viz.,
the devotee becomes God’s own self. By attaining perfection
in either Karmayoga or Jnanayoga, a striver gets the fruit
of both (Gita 5/4-5). - a , |

If a person has the only aim of salvation and has no selfish
motive by having affinity for wealth-property and family-relatives
etc., then he crosses the worldly delusion. If he does not want to
gain bookish knowledge (rot-learning) by studying the scriptures
but has the only aim to realize the self, he crosses the scriptural
delusion. It means that a striver, should neither be enamoured

by the worldly delusion nor by the scriptural (philosophical)
differences of opinions viz., he should not insist on any sect
or religion. Thus he becomes eligible for ‘Yoga’, salvation or
devotion. Besides this there is no need of any special eligibility
(qualification).

| further (in 3/1-2). Had Arjuna put a question regarding his doubts
about action and knowledge, in the fifty-fourth verse here, then
his question regarding the mark of the man of steadfast wisdom,
would have been much delayed. ]

'Samadhisthasya't— Here, this term has been used for the
person who has attained God-realization.

‘Sthitaprajiiasya'—This term has been used both for the
enlightened (God-realized) soul, as well as the striver. The
striver who is of a firm resolve and who never budges from
his spiritual path, is also called a man of steadfast wisdom. The
realized soul whose intellect is already steadfast, is also a man
of steadfast wisdom. :

Now, the question arises, while Arjuna put the question about
the enlightened soul only, why Lord Krsna included the striver
too. The answer is that, in the Discipline of Knowledge aspirants
generally develop disinclination for activities. The perfect soul
gets total disinclination. An aspirant of the Discipline of Devotion,
has an inclination to the recitation of Divine name, meditation,
association with holy men and study of the scriptures etc. These —
activities pervade in abundance, in him. In the perfect state, only

* Here the word ‘Samadhi’ has been used for God as it was also used in the
forty-fourth verse of this chapter.
"
245,"202 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
activities pertaining to God are performed. Thus there is a clear
difference in the degree of activities, of aspirants and realized
souls in both the Disciplines of Knowledge and Devotion. But
in the Discipline of Action, the flow of activities goes on as
usual, without any change, in both the stages—as a striver and
a perfected soul. So, there is a description of strivers, from the
forty-first verse to the forty-fifth verse, and also from the forty-
seventh verse to the fifty-third verse. Thus, in the context, the
means by which strivers, can be perfect souls” have been enunciated
and the marks of the perfect soul, have also been described.

""Ka bhasa'—What is the description or mark of an enlightened
soul? (Lord Krsna answers this question in the next verse).

'Sthitadhih kim prabhaseta'—How does the enlightened soul
speak? (Lord Krsna _ will answer this question in fifty-sixth and
fifty-seventh verses.)

‘Kimasita'—How does he sit viz., how does he become
dispassionate? (Lord Krsna has answered these in verses from
fifty-eighth to sixty-third.) :

'Vrajeta kim'—How does he walk viz., how does he behave?
(Lord Krsna has answered this question in the verses sixty-fourth
to seventy-first.) :

, — The Blessed Lord said: :
| - QO Partha (Arjuna), when a man discards all his desires visiting
the mind, and is self-satisfied in own self, he is said to be stable,
in wisdom. 55
Comment:— oo | |
[According to the gospel of the Gita, a striver, can
attain perfection, (God-realization), by any discipline (that of |
Disinterested Action or Devotion etc.,) which he follows according
to his interest and liking and his perfection is described by that
means only. Example—A striver following the Discipline of
Devotion worships God constantly, meditating on Him with
exclusive devotion (12/6). Therefore, in the enlightened state,
he becomes free from malice towards all beings (12/13). In
the Discipline of Knowledge the striver perceives himself
detached from these gunas (attributes) (modes) and is above
them (14/19) and in the enlightened state, he sits like a witness
firmly established in God, beyond all the gunas, having risen above
them (14/22—25). Similarly, in Karmayoga it is the abandoning
of all desires that is important. Hence the enlightened soul
abandons all desires. In this verse Lord Krsna dwells upon this point. ]
'‘Prajahati yada kamansarvanpartha manogatan'—It means that
desire does not exist in the self, because the self is everlasting
while desire is transient. Moreover it does not stay permanently
in the mind but comes into it—'manogatan'. But the man by
identifying himself with body, senses, mind and intellect, accepts
the desire visiting the mind as resting in his own self.
‘Jahati'—Use of the prefix ‘Pra’ before the verb ‘jahati’,
indicates that there is no trace of any desire left in him. A man
can neither renounce his own self nor the things which are not
his own, but he can renounce only the things which actually are
not his own, but he has mistaken them as his own. Similarly,
desires do not exist in one's own self, but one accepts them as
existing in one's own self, so he has to cast them off.
"
247,"204 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 2

The term ‘kaman’ (desires) also includes the term 'sarvan’'
(all), yet ‘sarvan' has been added to emphasize the fact that,
every fragment of all the desires should be cast off.

'Atmanyevatmana tustah'—After abandoning all the desire
completely, a man is satisfied in himself and with himself i.e.,
he is spontaneously contented in his own self. |

Contentment is of two kinds—one is said to be a virtue as
it relates to inner sense. It is there as a result of no desire in
the inner sense. But the other kind is the self itself. As the self
never has any trace of discontentment so it is called contentment
incammate the Self itself). The latter contentment is eternal. It
knows no change. It is spontaneous. It is not the result of any
practice or thought. The intellect of such a contented men always
remains steadfast automatically. |

'Sthitaprajiiastadocyate'—Actually a man is always steady in
wisdom, but when he accepts his desires, because of unsteady
mind, he does not realize his stableness in wisdom. When he
abandons his desires viz., accepts the non-existence of desires,
he realizes his stability in wisdom.

A striver has to make effort to concentrate his mind, but by
renouncing desires he does not have to do so, instead he attains
this stage, in a spontaneous manner. :

In the discipline of action, the striver is concerned with
actions more than anything else. Action without selfish motive,
is said to be the means for a sage to attain Yoga (Gita 6/3).
Therefore such a striver is concerned with actions relating
to the stage when he is a striver, as well as when he is an
enlightened soul. Whatever standard an enlightened soul sets,
people in general, follow the same (Gita 3/21). The Lord has
explained, in the fourth chapter also, that the striver following the
Discipline of Disinterested Action while performing actions remains
detached and while remaining detached he performs actions (4/18).

In the fifty-third verse Lord Krsna had advised two things
"
248,"Verse 55] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 205
to Arjuna, to keep his intellect immovable regarding scriptural
doctrine and steady in God. So He has used the term ‘yada’
(when) and 'tada' (then) which explain, that a striver is called
stable in wisdom when he is completely free from desires, and
is satisfied in the self. It also means that he is called a striver so
long as he has even a fragment of desire left and an enlightened
soul when desires are totally renounced. Therefore, two important
factors have been explained in the verse—to renounce the desire
and to get established in God.

The same two factors have been explained, in verses fifty-
six; fifty-seven; fifty-eight; fifty-nine; sixty and sixty-one; sixty-
two to sixty-five; sixty-six to sixty-eight; sixty-nine; seventy and
seventy-one and seventy-two.

Appendix—One division is of those who are of unsteady
intellect while the other division is of those of steady intellect.
The Lord has described the men of unsteady intellect from the
forty-first verse to the forty-fourth verse; now He describes the
men of steady wisdom from the fifty-fifth verse to the seventy-first
verse. When a striver having renounced the worldly inclination
is established in the self, he is said to be stable in wisdom.

He, who has the aim of God-realization, has a determinate
and single pointed intellect because God is also only one. But
he who has the worldly aim, his intellect is full of numberless
desires because worldly objects are numberless (Gita 2/41).

In order to attain equanimity, steadiness of intellect is very
necessary. In Patafjala YogadarSana importance has been attached
to stability of mind (concentration of the mind). But the Gita
attaches importance to the stability of intellect (steadfastness of
aim). The reason is that in God-realization the steadiness of the
mind is not so important as is the steadiness of intellect. By the
steadiness of mind worldly ‘siddhis’ (accomplishments or occult
powers) are gained but by the steadiness of intellect, spiritual
perfection (salvation) is attained. In Karmayoga steadiness of
"
249,"206 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2

intellect .is important. If the mind becomes concentrated, how

will a Karmayogi discharge his duty? The reason is that when

the mind becomes steady, the outward activities stop. The Lord

also orders Arjuna to discharge his duties being steadfast in Yoga
| (equanimity)—‘yogastha kuru karmani’ (Gita 2/48).

The Lord by using the terms ‘prajahati’ and ‘kamansarvan’
means that there shouldn’t be even a trace of desire, but it should
be renounced totally. The reason is that this desire is the main
stumbling block to God-realization.

He, whose mind remains unperturbed in sorrow, who does not
crave for pleasure, and who is free from passion, fear and anger
is called a sage with stable wisdom. 56
Comment:— |

[Arjuna puts a question, attaching importance to action, while
Lord Krsna answers, attaching importance to feelings, because
a change in feeling brings about a corresponding change in
action.* The Lord is discussing here, the feeling or the motive
which change the character of action throughout outwardly, it
may seem quite different.] :

* Whenever in the Gita Arjuna puts a question attaching importance to
action, Lord Krsna answers it attaching importance to feelings and understanding
because an action is performed according to the feelings and understanding. For
example Arjuna in the fourteenth chapter asked, ""What are the marks of him who
has transcended the three modes?"" Lord Krsna attaching importance to feelings
replies, ""He remains even-minded.""
"
250,"Verse 56] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI ‘207

* Puhkhesvanudvignamanah’—There is no end to sorrow,
calumny, dishonour and unfavourable circumstances, in this
world. But a man of wisdom, remains unperturbed, because the
aim of his life is to discharge his duty to the best of his ability
and capacity, for the welfare to others, without having any desire
for its. fruit. So, he always remains happy and unperturbed even
in the most unfavourable circumstances. :

'‘Sukhesu vigatasprhah'—He does not crave for any kind of
pleasure such as praise, honour and favourable circumstances etc.,
nor does he have a desire to prolong, such a state. He remains
unruffled in the midst of favourable or hostile circumstances.

'Vitaragabhayakrodhah'—Our entanglement with worldly
things, is known as attachment (raga). If a stronger person
tries to deprive us of worldly possessions, it arouses fear in us,
whereas if a weaker person does so, it arouses anger in us. But
a person who is keen to do good to others, automatically gets
rid of attachment. This freedom from attachment, leads him to
fearlessness and calmness. Thus he becomes free from attachment,
fear and anger. i :

So long as there are perturbations, cravings, attachment,
fear and anger, even in a small measure, a man is called a
striver. But when he is totally free from them, he becomes an
enlightened soul.

[Lust, desire, craving and greed etc., are forms of
attachment. In attachment there is an attraction, for the perishable
worldly objects.} | |

’Sthitadhirmunirucyate'—The mind of such a follower of the
Discipline of Selfless Action, becomes stable. Here, the term
‘muni’ has not been used, for a person who keeps silent. The
Lord has also not used the term 'mauna’ for penance of speech,
but He has used it for mental penance (Gita 17/16). So here,
‘muni: has been used for a contemplative person, free from desire
and attachment. He contemplates to remain unattached, like an
"
251,"208 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
enlightened soul. Throughout his practice he is very cautious to
remain unattached. Such cautiousness automatically persists in
an enlightened soul. That awareness leads him to attainment of
beatitude (Gita 3/19). It is because of this virtue of awareness,
that he has been described by the term 'muni.' |

Comment:— |
[In the previous verse, Lord Krsna explained that a man
of stable wisdom remains unperturbed, while discharging his
duty. In this verse, he explains, that such a man remains stable
in favourable and unfavourable circumstances, which he comes
across as a result of the deeds he performs.] |
""Yah sarvatranabhisnehah'—He remains unattached everywhere
viz., he is not attached to his body, senses, mind, intellect, family
and possessions. He never identifies himself with them, but always
remains untainted by them. Despite his physical association with
senses, objects, circumstances and individuals etc., he remains
quite unattached with them, through the self. |
'Tattatprapya Subhasubham nabhinandati na dvesti—He
remains untainted and unaffected by good and bad, favourable
~ and unfavourable circumstances. Experiencing good or pleasant,
he is not delighted. This delight means mental joy and expression
of joy through words. By encountering evil or unpleasant, he is
not dejected. This dejection means mental suffering and despair,
"
252,"Verse 58] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 209
and the thought why and how this situation has occurred, and
how to get rid of the unpleasant situation. He remains untainted
in favourable and unfavourable circumstances, which we got as
a result of destiny. : :

The expression, ‘tat, tat’, signifies that meeting with all
agreeable and disagreeable persons, incidents, objects and
circumstances that can possibly cause mental perturbations; he
neither rejoices in them-nor hates them whenever, wherever, and
however, he may meet with them:

'Tasya prajiia pratisthita'—His determinate intellect, now
becomes stable in God. -He understands that he is entirely

| unconcerned with the good and evil of the world, because these
always change, while he (soul) always remains the same. There
is no modification in the self, while in the evolutes of matter,
there is always modification. Man identifies himself with the
body and regards the modification of the body as modification
in his own self. But when he realizes the two as separate, his
intellect becomes stable. |

The second interpretation is, that limitless and endless God
cannot be perceived by the intellect, which is limited. So the
intellect merges in God and then there remains nothing besides God.
This is fixation of intellect. in God or stability in wisdom.

A Karmayog! is ever active. Therefore, the Lord, in the fifty-
sixth verse, mentions that he neither craves for success (pleasure)
nor is he perturbed in failure (sorrow), while in this verse He
declares that he neither delighted at receiving the agreeable nor
dejected at the disagreeable. |

Comment:— |

. ""Yada samharate cayarh kirmo'nganiva sarvaSah indriyanind-
riyarthebhyastasya prajiia pratisthita'—Here, the purpose of the
illustration of the tortoise is, that as a tortoise withdraws its six
limbs—four legs, a tail and a head—into the shell to protect
itself against possible dangers, so does an enlightened one also
withdraw his five senses and one mind from sense-objects. If
he has the least affinity with senses, he cannot be a man of

stable wisdom. : .
Here the verb 'sarnharate’, has been used, to emphasize the
fact, that he does not even think of worldly pleasures.
In this verse the term ‘yada’ has been used but 'tada’ is not used.

The reason is, that when the senses are withdrawn from their

' gense-objects, the self which is axiomatic, is realized, because
that is beyond the limit of time. So the word 'tada’ which denotes
time, has not been applied. Self-realization or God-realization is
axiomatic, and 1s beyond the reach of senses, but we are veiled
by the curtain of pleasures and thus cannot realize Him. He still
exists. But as soon as that veil is removed viz., we renounce
our affinity to the worldly pleasures, and He is revealed.

visaya Vinivartante. niraharasya dehinah. .

Sense-objects cease to exist for him, who does not enjoy them

with his senses, but the taste for them may persist. This relish,

also disappears from a man of stable mind, when he, realises

the Supreme. 59

Comment:—

'Visaya vinivartante niraharasya dehinah rasavarjam'— A man
becomes an abstainer in two ways (1) Fasting by one's own will
or owing to sickness. (11) Abstaining from sense enjoyments. Here, .
the term has been used, to refer to a striver, who withdraws his
senses from sense-objects.

_ The senses of a sick man become unfit for indulgence,
but craving in them, for sense enjoyment persists. He hopes to
enjoy these after recovery. Similarly, sense-objects cease for the
abstinent striver, but the taste persists. It means that his body
and senses come under restraint, but his mind wanders.

The dispassionate strivers who have instinctively no attachment |
for pleasure, become free from this taste. The striver who wants
to follow the spiritual path but is not dispassionate, can restrain
his body and senses by thinking of the adverse consequences
of sense enjoyments, though his taste persists.

""Raso'pyasya param drstva nivartate'—The relish of the man
of steadfast wisdom, who realises the Supreme, disappears. It 1s
a rule. But the contrary that with the disappearance (cessation)
of relish, a striver attains steadfast wisdom, is not true.

""Raso'pyasya’ means that a striver has feeling in his egoism
viz., 'I ness'. This taste changes itself into attachment. Therefore,
a striver should have determination that he as a striver has no
attachment, no desire. This sort of determination (aim) frees him
from relish, and after realizing God this relish disappears altogether.

Appendix—By accepting the existence and attaching value to
pleasures, in the mind there ensues a subtle attraction, lovability
"
255,"212 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
and sweetness for pleasures, it is named ‘Rasa’ (relish). As a
greedy man rejoices at heart by receiving money and a voluptuary
is rejoiced at heart by coming in contact with a woman, it is
called ‘Rasa’. After enjoying pleasure a man declares, “Oh! how
much I relished!’’ This is recollection of that ‘Rasa’ (relish).
This relish abides in the assumed ego (I’ness) (cijjadagranthi).
The gross form of this relish is attachment to pleasures.

So long as a man has relish for sense enjoyments, he has
to depend on Prakrti (Matter) and its evolutes (actions, objects
and persons). When he is free. from this relish, his dependence
totally perishes, his dependence on sense enjoyments stops and
he is no longer a slave to them. a

So long as a person accepts the existence of pleasures, attaches
importance to them and has relish for them, the spiritual (unworldly)

.  Yelish for God is not revealed. Not to speak of unworldly relish,
he can’t have the determinate intellect to attain Him (Gita 2/44).
After merely withdrawing outwardly the senses from sense objects,
the relish (taste) persists. By attaining Self-realization this taste
disappears, this relish disappears—‘pararn drstva nivartate’. It
means that when a striver realizes that he is different from the ©
world and realizes his identity with God, then the perishable taste
disappears. With the disappearance (cessation) of the perishable
taste, imperishable (non-stop) relish is aroused.

After Self-realization this relish for pleasures certainly
disappears but even before Self-realization by being indifferent
to it, by reflection, by good company and by the grace of saints, a
striver can be free from this relish. The company of the enlightened
exalted souls can also free a striver from this taste (relish).

The three disciplines—Karmayoga, Jnanayoga and Bhaktiyoga
can free a striver from the perishable relish. When a striver
starts relishing the taste of service in Karmayoga, the taste of
Self-realization in Jaanayoga and the taste of devotion (love)
in Bhaktiyoga, his relish for the perishable pleasures starts
"
256,"Verse 59] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 213
disappearing. As a child in childhood relishes toys but when
he grows up, he starts relishing wealth, then his relish for toys
naturally disappears. Similarly when a striver relishes the spiritual
discipline, the relish for mundane pleasures naturally disappears.
When relish persists and pleasures are enjoyed, then a man’s
heart melts and he is overpowered by pleasures. But when he
is freed from relish, he may come across worldly pleasures but
they don’t cause the least agitation in his mind (Gita 2/70).
He has no such inclination that pleasure may attract him. As’
you put a bag of money before an animal, it does not covet
for it and after seeing a beautiful woman it is not lustful. An
. animal doesn’t know the value of money and a woman but
an enlightened exalted soul knows money as well the.
woman (Gita 2/69), yet he is free from greed and lust. When we
have an itching sensation in any organ of the body, we scratch
it with our fingers, and when this sensation ends, it does not
make any difference in fingers, there is no alteration in them. :
Similarly an enlightened soul uses the sense-objects but his mind
remains the same unperturbed and free from agitation. The reason
is that being free from relish, he has no inclination for enjoying’
pleasures. Whatever he does, he does it for the welfare of others
and to comfort them. Contemplation on the sense-objects for
one’s own pleasure leads one to ruin or fall (Gita 2/62-63). But
even the use of the sense-objects not for one’s own pleasure,
does not lead to bondage (Gita 2/64-65). .
The perishable relish (taste) is instantaneous, it does not
Jast long. The relish which we have for a woman or money at
the beginning does not persist in the same degree afterwards.
We relish the food at the beginning but after each morsel the
relish decreases and finally ends and then we have a dislike for
that food. But the imperishable relish never lessens but always
remains the same. Enjoyment of the perishable relish results in
inertness, shortage, grief, diseases, fear, commotion and other evils.

257,"| 214 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
| A voluptuous person can’t escape these evils because pleasures
certainly lead to these evils. Therefore the Lord has mentioned the

Comment:—

""Tani sarvani sarhnyamya yukta asita matparah'—By controlling

because pride goes before a fall. He should, rather, feel that it

Generally, in a striver following the Discipline of Action, there is
predominance of action. Therefore, he develops egoism. Due to
this egoistic feeling, he pays little attention to the divine grace,
though the endowment of human body, inclination, practice and
success of this discipline, are all the result of divine grace. By
His special divine grace, the Lord is exhorting the striver to be
devoted to Him. Thus, he should devote himself heart and soul
to Him, thinking that he is God's and God is his, while he is

neither of the world nor is the-world his. He should infuse a
sense of 'T' in only God, not in the world, at all. .

This section deals with the Discipline of Disinterested
Action. So, Lord Krsna should have told Arjuna some method
of that discipline. But Lord Krsna time and again has laid great
emphasis on devotion to Him, and has glorified it very much.
So He declares— ""Among all Yogis, he who worships Me with
faith, his innermost self merged in Me, is considered by Me, to
be the best Yogi—most devout (Gita 6/47)."" |

""Vase hi yasyendriyani tasya prajiia. pratisthita'—In the
fifty-ninth verse, Lord Krsna said, that even with the cessation
of sense-objects, a striver does not become a man of steadfast
wisdom. But, here he says that the wisdom of the striver who
has controlled his senses, is stable. Why? The clarification is
that, in 2/59 even at the cessation of the sense-objects the taste
(relish) for sense enjoyments persists. But here in this verse,
the senses of the striver are controlled and his taste has also
disappeared. Thus the striver becomes stable in wisdom, (mind)
at the cessation of taste.

Appendix—The Lord exhorts the striver following Karmayoga
to devote himself heart and soul to Him by using the term
‘matparah’—this is a special feature of devotion because without
being devoted to Him, total control over senses is difficult.

In Karmayoga there is renunciation and renunciation leads
to peace and happiness. This happiness follows cessation of
miseries. This is with a result of attaining something. A Bhaktiyogi
attains eternal bliss. Therefore without the bliss attained by
devotion (love), senses are not totally controlled. Secondly in
Karmayoga only by intense dispassion (detachment), senses
are controlled but in devotion (being devoted to God) even
by a little dispassion, senses are easily controlled. Therefore
the Lord has used the term ‘matparah’. -

to God? The answer is provided in the next two verses.

Contemplating constantly on the objects of senses, a man
develops attachment for them; from attachment springs desire
and from desire (unfulfilled) originates anger. From anger arises
delusion; from delusion, confusion of memory; from which grows
loss of reason; and with loss of reason (discrimination), he goes to
complete ruin. 62-63.
Comment:—

. ‘Dhyayato visayanpumsah sangastesupajayate’-—When a
man does not devote himself to God viz., he does not meditate
on God, he broods on objects of senses, because in that
case there is nothing else to contemplate on, except the world.
Thus, by. brooding over them, he develops attachment for
them. Due to this attachment he enjoys sense-objects. This
enjoyment may be mental or physical. The pleasure resulting
from enjoyment, enhances attachment. Due to this enhanced
attachment, he repeatedly dwells on sense-objects. It is a rule
that the enhanced attachment persists, whether he enjoys the
sense-objects or not. ,

'‘Sangatsafijayate kamah'—By developing attachment for
"
261,"218 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter2
sense enjoyments, one has a desire to acquire and enjoy those
sense-objects. —

""Kamatkrodho'bhijayate'— Gratification of desire misleads to
greed and one who creates an obstacle in the possibility of its
gratification, becomes a victim of anger. The desire for respect
and honour on the ground of caste, stage of life and virtues etc.,
also causes anger, if some obstacles are put in its gratification.

Desire is a rajasika trait; delusion a tamasika one, and anger
lies between the two. If you are angry with either, it means that
you have attachment for something or the other. If you are angry
with a man who defames you, it means that you are attached

: to fame. If you are enraged with a person who censures you, it
proves your pride of innocence and so on.

'Krodhadbhavati sammohah'—From anger, ensues delusion. In
fact, delusion ensues not only from anger, but also from desire,
greed and attachment.

(i) Delusion born of desire, veils discrimination and so a
man goaded by desire performs undesirable actions.

(11) Out of anger, a deluded person utters harsh and pinching
words, to even friends and adorable ones, and performs wrong
and cruel deeds.

(iti) Delusion born of greed makes a man blind and he cannot

_ distinguish between the real and the unreal, the right and the
wrong and he cheats others by using fraudulent methods.
. (iv) Delusion born of attachment, creates partiality.

Now the question arises, why Lord Krsna has said that
delusion ensues from anger while it ensues from desire, greed
and attachment, as well. If we give a serious thought, we come
to know that goaded by desire, greed and attachment, a man
thinks of his own selfish motive and pleasure, while in anger
he thinks of doing evil to others. Thus, delusion born of anger
is more disastrous, than that born of the other three. Therefore
"
262,"Verse 64-65] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 219
Lord Krsna has said that delusion ensues from anger.
~ 'Sammohiatsmrtivibhramah'—From delusion arises confusion of
memory. It means that a man forgets his aim to attain salvation,
or to follow the spiritual path, in accordance with the ordinance
of the scriptures etc. | 4 ,
'Smrtibhramsad buddhinasah'—From confusion of memory
arises loss of reason viz., a man cannot discriminate between
right and wrong. | |
‘Buddhinasatpranagyati'—Loss of discrimination paves the
way to self-destruction. , :
Therefore, it is obligatory for all strivers to devote themselves
heart and soul to God, in order to escape self-destruction.

_ Brooding on the objects of senses, leads to attachment;
attachment leads to desire; desire to anger; anger to delusion;
delusion to loss of memory; loss of memory to loss of reason
and finally, loss of reason leads to utter ruin. Though, it takes
time to describe this order yet the rise of these propensities
leading to the destruction of man is, as fast as death caused
by an electric shock. | |

- _ But a self-controlled Yogi in practice or a striver, while

Loe the attainment of such placidity, all his sorrows come to an

oe end; and the intellect of such a person of tranquil mind, soon

- becomes, firmly established in God. 64-65

na ‘Comment:—

7 'Tu'—In the previous verse, Lord Krsna said, that by

| contemplating on the objects of senses a man goes to complete
ruin, while here He says that the striver, free from attachment

| while using the sense-objects with the senses, becomes firmly
established in God. So the Lord has used the term ‘tu’ (but), to

- differentiate between the two. :

a -  'Vidheyatma'—To achieve his aim it is very necessary for a
| striver, specially for a Karmayogi, to control his mind, otherwise

: he may have attachment for pleasure and thus may go to ruin.

7 'Atmavasyaih ragadvesaviyuktaih indriyaih'—As the term
‘vidheyatma’ has been used for controlling the mind, so the

7 word ‘atmavasyaih’ is used, for sense-control. In worldly dealings,

. senses should be kept under control, and for sense-control
oo they should be free from attachment and aversion. Therefore,
Lord Krsna, in the thirty-fourth verse of the third chapter, has

7 warned strivers and said, ""attachment and aversion are rooted,

oe ~ jn all sense-objects. A striver should not come under their sway,

7 because they are verily his enemies."" Similarly He has said in

- the third verse of the fifth chapter, ""The striver who is free from

. the pairs of opposites, such as attachment and aversion etc., is

| easily set free from bondage.”

, ‘Visayan caran'—A striver, who has controlled his mind
and whose senses are controlled and free from attachment and
aversion, uses the sense-objects, but does not enjoy them viz.,
he does not derive pleasure from them. And it is enjoyment,

rather than use, which leads him to ruin. |
"
264,"Verse 64-65] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 221
'‘Prasadamadhigacchati'—A striver who utilizes the sense-
objects being free from attachment and aversion attains placidity
(purity) of mind. This placidity (serenity) of mind, is. called
mental austerity (Gita 17/16) which is superior to the austerity
of body and austerity of speech. So a striver should neither
enjoy the sense-objects with attachment, nor should renounce
them with aversion, because both attachment and aversion lead ,
him to affinity for the world. Such a striver attains placidity of
mind and if that placidity of mind, is not enjoyed, that leads to
God-realization.
'‘Prasade sarvaduhkhanarn hanirasyopajayate'—With the
attainment of such placidity of mind, all his sorrows come to
an end, because it is attachment only, which causes sorrows.
These sorrows give birth to desire which again causes sorrow.
When attachment goes away, the mind becomes serene and that
serenity destroys all sorrows. Actually all the sorrows are born
because of affinity for matter and its evolutes—the world and
the body. A striver has affinity for the world, with the desire to
enjoy pleasures. This desire is born of despair or the feeling of
something lacking in himself. When there is placidity of mind,
despair disappears. When despair is lost, there is no desire for
pleasures, and when there is no desire for pleasures, affinity for
the world automatically breaks off, and then sorrows disappear. It
means that placidity of the mind, results in breaking off affinity
for the world and establishment of the self in God. |
Here 'Sarvaduhkhanam hanth' does not mean that a striver
will not come across unfavourable and sorrowful circumstances;
but it means that those circumstances cannot create commotion
and agitation in his mind. |
‘Prasannacetaso hyasu buddhih paryavatisthate'—The intellect
of such a person of tranquil mind, soon becomes firmly established
in God viz., the striver himself becomes established in God and —
his intellect has no doubts, in the least.
"
265,"222 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2

Enhancement of either placidity or uneasiness. for God,
enables a striver to realize God. The Gopis were locked up by
their husbands, brothers and parents and prevented from meeting
Lord Krsna. The uneasiness to meet the Lord, destroyed their
sins and the placidity of mind by meditation on God, destroyed
their virtues. Thus, being free from sins and virtues, and leaving
their bodies, they were the first to meet God. But in the worldly
affairs, placidity and uneasiness of mind, lead a man to bondage
and strengthen the bondage, because his aim is to enjoy the
worldly pleasures. The living examples are common worldly
people who are entangled in the worldly snare, because of
placidity and uneasiness, in mundane affairs.

The inner self, is overwhelmed in placidity and uneasiness. Just
as the colour which is added to.liquid wax becomes a permanent
part of it, in the same way, whatever thoughts are put into the
overwhelmed inner self these become a permanent part of it and
lead the striver to salvation or to damnation. Therefore a striver
should neither be pleased nor displeased, while gaining or losing
the most charming objects of the world. |

Appendix—There are two divisions—one of ‘Bhoga’
(pleasures) and one of ‘Yoga’. If a ‘Bhogi’ (voluptuary) having
attachment and aversion dwells upon the objects of senses, he
goes to ruin (fall) (Gita 2/62-63). But if a ‘Yogi’ freed from
attachment and aversion utilizes. sense-objects, he does not go
to ruin, rather he attains God.

: A person freed from likes and dislikes does not enjoy and
relish pleasures because it is not his aim. He utilizes the sense-
objects without coming under the sway of attachment, having the
sense of detachment (Gita 3/34). Therefore he attains placidity
(purity) of mind. The use of sense-objects with the sense of
renunciation, is indeed not ‘Bhoga’. From the view-point of
"
266,"Verse 66] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 223
people it appears that he is using sense-objects; therefore here
the expression ‘visayan caran’ has been used.

By being free from attachment and aversion, placidity of
mind is attained. There should be cheerfulness every time, there
should not be any distress, there should not be monotony—this
is ‘Prasada’ (placidity of mind). If a striver is not satiated with
this placidity and he does not enjoy it, it will very quickly lead
him to God-realization.

He, who has not controlled his mind and senses, can have
no determinate intellect; nor can such an undisciplined man
have a sense of duty. A man without having a sense of duty,
can have no peace; and how can there be happiness, for
one lacking peace? 66
Comment:—

[In the Discipline of Disinterested Action, control over the
mind and senses is important, because without control, desire
persists and with the persistence of desire, the mind does not
get fixed. Therefore, it is obligatory for a striver following
the Discipline of Action to control his mind and senses. What
happens to the man who has not controlled his mind and senses,
is explained in this verse.] |

'Nasti buddhirayuktasya'—He who has not controlled his
mind and senses cannot have determinate intellect* that he has

* Without change of the sense of I (egotism), senses are not controlled
"
267,"224 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
only to realize God, because he indulges in worldly pleasures
and seeks prosperity. He develops desire for riches, honour and

_ bodily comforts etc. These numerous desires, keep his intellect
obsessed and do not allow him to have a stable intellect.

‘Na cayuktasya bhavana’—He whose intellect is not
determinate, cannot have the feeling, that he has to discharge

| his duty by renouncing attachment and desire etc., because he
has not fixed the aim of his life.

'Na cabhavayatah santih'— The man, who does not discharge
his duty efficiently and sincerely, can have no peace, whosoever
he may be. oo :

‘ASantasya kutah sukham'~-How can he who lacks peace
be happy? He cannot be happy, because his heart is filled with
agitation and commotion. Despite acquiring all agreeable sense-
objects, his mental perturbation cannot be wiped out. In other
words he cannot be happy. |

of a person who had not controlled his mind and senses, cannot
be determinate.

_ Just as the wind sails a ship on water, the mind that yields
to one of the wandering senses, takes away the discrimination of

and without sense-control there cannot be determinate intellect. But 1f a striver
changes his egotism and accepts that he is a striver whose aim is nothing but
God-realization, his mind and senses are instinctively controlled.
"
268,"Verse 67] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 225
Comment:— : |

[God has bestowed upon man a human body to attain Him.
So a man should firmly resolve to attain God-realization. This
resolve, removes his attachment for pleasures and makes his
intellect determinate. But what happens if the intellect does not
become determinate, has been described here.]

'  ""Indriyanam hi caratérh yanmano'nu vidhiyate'—Senses are
involuntarily drawn to the sense-objects. Mind that follows anyone
of the senses, is naturally led astray ‘by it. For example, while
relishing a tasteful dish, the sense of taste gets attached to it,
and then it attracts the mind, and thus the misdirected mind gets
entangled in this taste.

_ 'Tadasya harati prajiiam'—When the mind gets entangled in
pleasures, man immediately loses his determinate intellect that
he has to realize God only.

'Vayurnavamivambhasi'—A ship without a rudder is at
the mercy of a strong wind. As a rudderless ship does not
reach its destination, a misdirected mind takes away man's
discrimination. |

A strong wind either pushes away the ship in the wrong
direction or sinks it. But a skilful sailor, manages the ship in
such a way, that the wind instead of pushing it away from
its course, helps it in sailing and reaching its destination.
Similarly, the misdirected mind misguides discrimination, in
two ways—lIt leads it astray from the path of God-realization
and engages it in sense-pleasures or it ruins him by entangling
it, in prohibited pleasures. But a controlled mind and senses
do not take the intellect away ward, they rather help one in
realizing God (2/64-65).

Appendix—Here a doubt may arise, why have the meanings
of the terms ‘yat’ and ‘tat’ been taken ‘mind’ rather than
‘senses’ viz., why has it been said that the mind rather than
"
269,"226 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {[Chapter2
senses takes away reason? The clarification is that in the
sixtieth verse of this chapter it has been said that senses
sway the mind and in the forty-second verse of the third
chapter it is mentioned that mind is superior to the senses
and intellect is greater (subtle, higher and more powerful)
than the mind. It proves that senses sway the mind and
the mind sways the intellect. Secondly in swaying the
intellect; the mind is important, senses are not important.
The reason is that unless the mind accompanies senses,
senses don’t know sense-objects—‘adhisthaya manascayarn
visayanupasevate’ (Gita 15/9). In Srimadbhagavata Datt&treyaji
Maharaja declares—
tadaivamatmanyavaruddhacitto na veda kificid bahirantaram va
yathesukaro nrpatim vrajantamisau gatatma na dadarSa parsve
_. (Srimadbha. 11/9/13)

‘‘He, whose mind ts tied up in the soul, has no knowledge
of anything outward or inward. I saw that an arrow-maker was
so much engrossed in arrow-making that he did not notice the
king’s cavalcade in procession passing by him.’’

The arrow-maker had the sense of hearing and its sense-
object was sound also, but he could not hear because his mind
was not diverted towards the procession. When without the mind,
the senses can’t even know their sense-objects, then how can
they sway the intellect? They can’t.

Link:— In the next verse, Lord Krsna describes the condition
of the striver, who has controlled his senses.

Therefore, O mighty-armed, his intellect is stable, whose senses
are completely controlled against sense-objects. 68 .
Comment:— | |

'Tasmadyasya mahabaho nigrhitani sarvasah indriyanindriyarthe-
bhyastasya prajiia pratisthita'—Lord Krsna concludes the topic of
the mind and the senses, by using the word 'tasmad' (therefore)
and says, that the intellect of a person whose mind and senses
are completely free from the worldly attractions, is stable.

By giving the term 'sarvasah' (completely), Hé means to
explain that his senses are not inclined towards pleasures,
whether he lives in the world or in seclusion and even if his
mind and senses are directed to the sense-objects, they do not
lead his intellect, astray. ° : |

‘Nigrhitani’ (restrained) means that the senses have no
attachment for the sense-objects. As a snake, without teeth has
no poison, senses without attachment and aversion, have no
poison to degrade a man from a spiritual path; these become
sublimated and lead a striver, to divinity.

This verse means, that if a striver has determination that his
aim is to realize God, rather than to enjoy worldly pleasures and
prosperity, his intellect will become stable.

are completely restrained from their objects, and an ordinary
man? Here is the answer.

That, which is night to all beings, in that state (of Divine
"
271,"228 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
Knowledge and Supreme Bliss) an emancipated person keeps
awake. And that (the everchanging worldly happiness), in which
all beings keep awake, is night, to the enlightened seer. 69
Comment:— | |

""Ya ni§A sarvabhiitanam'—Those worldly people whose senses
and mind are uncontrolled and who are immersed in pleasure
are, asleep in the dark, because they never think that the aim
of human life, is emancipation or salvation. Further, they never
think ""What is God?’ ""What is Self-realization?’ ""Why are we
suffering?’ ""Why are there all these burning sensations?’ Where
will our misdeeds take us?' Turning away from these thoughts,

: ‘1s complete darkness, for the worldly people. .

Here the term, 'bhitinadm’, has been used to explain the fact

that human beings who hanker after pleasures and prosperity,
and are immersed in them, are like other beings, such as
birds and beasts etc., because both have no inclination for
God-realization. If there is any difference between the two, it
is that discrimination, human beings is much more developed
than beasts’ and birds, and therefore, by using discrimination,
‘they can serve others and attain salvation or God-realization,
while birds and beasts cannot. On the other hand, if they
misuse this discrimination in hankering after pleasures and
prosperity, they can be more harmful to the society, than
even wild beasts. Animals and birds eat food, only to sustain
their life, they never hoard. But human beings are given to
hoarding, whatever they get. Therefore, they create obstacles
to the utilization of those things by others.

'Tasyam jagarti sarnyami'—When the worldly people remain
asleep in the dark, having no inclination for God-realization, the
seer who has controlled his senses and mind and who has no
attachment for pleasures and prosperity and whose aim. of life
is only God-realization, remains wakeful because his intuition,
"
272,"Verse 69] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 229
his concepts and precepts, are all filled with Divinity. -.

'Yasyam jagrati bhitani'—-The worldly people who want
to accumulate wealth, by means fair or foul, and who hanker
after transient sensual pleasures, honour and praise etc., are
wakeful .of mundane affairs. : :

‘Sa ni§& pasyato muneh'—The worldly people, feel very
happy and deem themselves very wise, in enjoying and
hoarding worldly pleasures. These, a seer, in the state of
Divine Knowledge and Supreme Bliss, perceives as dark.

- As children, while playing marbles attach great importance
to small balls, of glass or clay, so people attach importance
to worldly prosperity and pleasure and for gaining these they
employ all sorts of means, fair or foul. But a self-controlled
seer, knows that all mundane pleasures, prosperity and praise
etc., are transient, illusory and changing, while God and his
own self, are eternal, real and permanent. He also knows, how
the best use of mundane objects can be made, and how far
they can be utilized, for the welfare of others. He uses them
in the service of others. |

In spite of the manifest appearance of the world to the
mind and senses, he has a firm conviction that the world 1s a
mere illusion, and has no real existence at all. So wakefulness
of the worldly people, is just like a dark night for him.

Appendix—-The worldly people remain busy in hoarding
wealth and enjoying pleasures and value them. They are very
clever and expert in worldly affairs. They learn different types
of arts and crafts, make several inventions, regard the worldly
achievements as their progress, glorify worldly things, perform
austere penance in order to enjoy pleasures by living forever,
worship gods, and recite (sacred text) incantation etc. But an
enlightened liberated exalted soul and strivers perceive all
this as dark, they don’t attach the least importance to such a
"
273,"230 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter2
progress, because from their view-point the entire: world upto
the abode of Brahma has no existence at all—‘nasato vidyate
bhavah’ (Gita 2/16), ‘abrahma bhuvanallokah punaravartino’rjuna’
(Gita 8/16). a |

The worldly people remain engrossed in worldly affairs and
think that there is nothing besides these pleasures—nanyadastiti
vadinah’ (Gita 2/42), ‘kamopabhogaparama etavaditi niscitah’
(Gita 16/11). Spirituality is beyond the access of their intellect.
But a striver following the spiritual path besides knowing
spirituality also knows the world. Therefore the term ‘pasyatah’
has been used for them. The worldly people perceive only the
night (they remain asleep in the dark), they don’t perceive
the day (Divinity), but a “Yogi’ perceives the day as well as
the night (the worldly pleasures and prosperity as dark)—this
is the difference between the two. For example a child has
perceived only childhood, not youth, but an old man besides
perceiving the old age has also perceived childhood and
youth. A hoarder of wealth doesn’t know renunciation while
a renunciate who has renounced the mundane wealth knows
the value of collection of wealth and also its renunciation. This
is a rule that a man engrossed in worldly affairs cannot know
the reality about the world. By keeping himself aloof from
the world, he can know the reality about the world because
in fact he is separate from the world. Similarly a person can
realize God by identifying himself with God because he (the
self) has his identity with God.

He who is established in ‘Is’. knows both ‘Is’ and ‘not’; but
he who is established in ‘not’ does not know (perceive) even
‘not’ in its reality as ever non-existent, then how will he know
‘Is’ (the real)? He can’t know. He has no capacity to know
them. He who knows ‘Is’ does not bear ill will with the
person who assumes the existence of ‘not’, but the :person who
"
274,"Verse 70] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 231
assumes the existence of ‘not’ bears ill will with the person
who knows ‘Is’. |

Link:—The world is just like a dark night to the seer. Then
how does he live in the world? The answer to these queries is
provided in the verse that follows.

Just as waters of different rivers enter the ocean, which
though full, remains undisturbed; likewise the man in whom
all enjoyments are merged and attains tranquillity, but not he,
who hankers after such enjoyments. 70 |
Comment:—

‘Apiryamanamacalapratistham samudramapah pravisanti
yadvat'—In the rainy season rivers expand and are flooded by
heavy rain storms. All the rivers continue to pour themselves
into an ocean, but its magnitude remains the same. In summer,
when heat evaporates the water of rivers and these become
narrow with shallow water, even then the expanse of an ocean
remains the same. It is ever full and never seeks water from
streams and rivers. It means, that it ever remains satiated, and
always within Itmits. |

'Tadvatkama* yam pravisanti sarve sa santimapnoti'— A

* Here the term ‘Kama’ has not been used for desires but for the objects of
pleasures which are desired.
"
275,"232 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
self-controlled seer, is like an ocean. He also comes across
worldly enjoyments, but these all merge in him without causing
any perturbation or agitation in his body and mind. Thus,
he attains supreme peace. This peace is not due to mundane
objects, but it emanated from God-realization (Gita 2/46).

In this illustration, the realized soul is compared to an
ocean and the water of the river, is compared to mundane

| objects. Both the water of the ocean and that of the river, are
of the same category. But the realized soul is quite different
in nature. There is a world of difference between the two. The
perfect soul is sentient eternal, real, limitless and endless, while
the enjoyments are insentient, perishable, unreal, limited and
have an end. Secondly, the waters of rivers enter the ocean
and merge in it, but the mundane objects flowing towards the
enlightened soul, do not reach the self, these merely reach his
body and inner sense. Thus the illustration of a river and the
ocean, though 1s not fully applicable here. It only describes the
state of one's body and inner sense. This does not explain the
state of his real self.

""Na kamakami'—Worldly enjoyments and pleasures cannot
satisfy a man, who hankers after them. He can never be satisfied.
He can never be free from desires, anxieties and burning sensation.
So how can he attain peace? The reason is, that ‘the insentient
cannot satisfy the sentient; the sentient can be satisfied only
by sentient. :

Appendix—It is because of one’s desire that this world
appears to be insentient (Matter) but actually it is none other
than the Supreme Soul (Divinity) (God)—‘Vasudevah sarvam’
(Gita 7/19), ‘sadasaccahamarjuna’ (Gita 9/19). When a person
is freed from desires, all objects get pleased with him. How to
know it? We know it. because necessities automatically come
to such a person without any effort. The things are eager to
"
276,"Verse 71] — SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 233
approach him for being fruitful through utilization by him.
But availability or non-availability of objects does not arouse
any morbid feelings in him, because he has no desire. From
his view-point objects have no value (importance). On the
other hand a person having desires, always remains perturbed
(disquiet) whether he receives things or not.

of longings and desires and has no thirst, for acquiring or
preserving even the necessities of life, as he has attained the
supreme bliss, for which the human body was bestowed upon
him. So, he becomes free from all cares and does not mind
even if his body lives or dies. a

In this verse, as well as in the fifty-fifth verse of this
chapter emphasis has been laid on renunciation of desires,
because in the Discipline of Disinterested Action, without
abandoning these no striver can possess steadfast wisdom. A
"
277,"234 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
striver has affinity for the world, only because of desires. If
desires are given up, no affinity for the world remains.

‘Nirmamah'—A man of stable wisdom, has not the least-
sense of mine, with men, things and even his body and _ senses,
because he has received them from the world. Therefore, they
belong to the world, not to him. It is a blunder to have a sense of
possession over things acquired. On rectification of this blunder
the sense of possession over persons, objects, body and sense-
organs is totally wiped out. - .

'Nirahankarah'—'I am this body'—to have this notion is
egoism. The realized soul is, free from the egoism. The body,

: sense-organs, mind and intellect are visible in some light. This

ego is, also perceived in this light. From the view-point of
this light, all these are objects of perception. An onlooker
(seer) is, quite different from the seen—this is the rule. With
this realization, a man of steady wisdom, becomes quite free
from egoism. |

'Sa §antimadhigacchati'—A man of steadfast wisdom attains
peace. It does not mean that he attains peace after being free
from desire, thirst for enjoyment, attachment and egoism. The
fact is that peace is inherent and spontaneous. But a man by
having desires to enjoy worldly pleasures cannot realize that
peace. But, as soon as he becomes free from desire, thirst
for necessities, a sense of mine and egoism, he can realize
that peace. |

In the verse, out of the four—<(desires, thirst for necessities,
the sense of mine and egoism), egoism is more important than the
other three, because a striver after becoming free from egoism,
becomes free from the other three also. If there is no egoism,
how will the sense of mine persist, who will desire and for
whom will he desire? |

Now the question arises, when the renunciation of. desire
"
278,"Verse 71] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI | 235
etc., is also included in the renunciation of egoism, why: has
Lord Krsna described the renunciation of desire separately?
The answer is, that out of these four, desire is gross while
thirst for necessities is subtle; the sense of mine, subtler; and
egoism the subtlest. So, by abandoning desire, it becomes easy |
to abandon the other three. | :

Nothing can be gained merely by desire, what is destined,
we will get. Having such a faith, we should discard desires.
‘sprha' is a subtle form of desire. In the absence of desire
even it persists. It (sprha) is the desire to have bare necessities
of life. In its fulfilment also we are not free. Whatever is
to happen, will happen. Then why should we have ‘sprha'?
When we cease to be dependent on food, water and clothing,
'sprha' is destroyed. After renouncing desires and 'sprha' the
sense Of mind in the body: remains. It is not a rule that
this possessive spirit, preserves articles and these are ruined
without this spirit. Therefore, the possessive spirit serves no
purpose. With renunciation of all the three—desire, 'sprha’ (subtle
desire) and possessive spirit, renunciation of ego, becomes very
easy, otherwise it is very difficult.

From the standpoint of the Discipline of Disinterested
Action: (Karmayoga)—'Nothing is mine; because I have no
independent claim on things, persons, circumstances, incidents :
and situations etc. When nothing is mine, it means that I need
nothing as I need food, water and clothes for the body, only
if it is mine; but if it is not mine, I need nothing for it.

, When there is clear understanding that nothing is mine and |
need nothing, there is no question of egoism (feeling of 'T'),
because egoism persists by accepting affinity for the body,
things and circumstances etc. The fact is that the so-called
body of mine has an affinity for the world, so it should be
"
279,"236 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
used to render service to the world, because J for myself need
nothing. By having this sort of feeling, egoism perishes and
' @ Striver becomes free from egoism and a sense of mine.
From the standpoint of Discipline of Knowledge:—every
man has the knowledge that 'I am’. In 'I am’, I, is a fragment
of nature and ‘am’ denotes ‘reality’ (Eternal Existence). This ‘am'
is used with ‘IT —In the absence of 'T’, 'am’ will not stand, only
‘Is' will remain.’ |
‘I am’, ‘you are’, ‘this is’ and ‘that is'—all these four,
are in respect of individuals, space and time. This is limited
conception. If this limited conception is not maintained, then
universal ‘Is' remains. When a striver is established in this
universal. ‘Is', he becomes completely free from the sense of
T’ and ‘mine’. |
From the standpoint of Discipline of Devotion (Bhaktiyoga)}—
What is called T' or ‘mine’ actually belongs to God, because
had the persons, things, body been mine, I might have protected
them from decay and possessed them forever. But it is not
so. It means that the so-called body of mine, senses, mind,
intellect etc., are His and I am also His. By having this sort |
of feeling, a striver becomes free from the sense of mine and
from egoism. a
Appendix—The Lord by the expression ‘so’ mrtatvaya Kalpate’
(Gita 2/15) explained attainment of perfection by Jnanayoga.
Now by the expression ‘sa Santimadhigacchati’ he mentions the
perfection by Karmayoga. It means that by being established
in Pure-consciousness (Self) immortality is attained and by
renouncing Matter (ego), tranquillity (peace) is attained.
“Egoism’ really does not exist, it is merely assumed in
the self. If it had really existed, we could not have been free
from egoism and the Lord would have also not told us to
be free from egoism. But the Lord mentions ‘nirahankarah’,
"
280,"Verse 71] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 237
so it means that we can be free from egoism. This is also
our experience that the self is free from egoism. In sound
sleep egoism disappears while the self exists—this is clearly
perceived when we arise from sleep. In sound sleep egoism
merges in ‘avidya’ (ignorance), but the self remains. Therefore

_ after arising from sleep (remembering that) we say “I slept so
comfortably that I knew nothing.’’. This memory proves that |
he (the self), who slept comfortably and who knew nothing,
was there. Otherwise who experienced comfort and who knew
nothing? In ‘I knew nothing’ there is no egoism and he who
had this knowledge is the self, free from egoism. —__

A woman’s nose-ring fell into a well. A man got down
into the well in order to search the nose-ring out. He searched
it out and was very pleased. But. at that time he could not
utter any word because voice (an evolute of fire) and water
are opposites. Therefore after coming out of water he could
speak that he had found out the nose-ring. Similarly in
sound sleep at the merger of egoism in ignorance, a man
feels that he enjoyed a carefree sleep but he can’t express it
at that time because there is no means to utter words. After
arising from the sound sleep he has the memory of that joy
(comfort). Memory is born of experience—‘anubhavajanyam
jhanam smrtth’. :

Thus in sound sleep everyone feels that egoism does not
persist but no one feels that the self does not exist. Egoism
can’t persist without us but we (self) can live without egoism
and do live. Our self is consciousness solidified. This eternal

- entity is not dependent on anyone but everyone is dependent
upon it. If we had not been different from egoism, we would
have been only in the form of egoism, then in sound sleep
at the merger of egoism we would have also no existence.
But we exist, it proves that we have our existence without
egoism. In wakefulness and dream, egoism appears and in
"
281,"238 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
sound sleep. egoism merges but we (the self) ever exist. What
neither appears nor merges is our identity.
- Having given up all the desires, for the maintenance of
the body some requirement of things, persons is felt that is
called ‘sprha’ (necessity). Not to talk of the necessities for the
maintenance of the body, the man of steadfast wisdom does
not even need the body because the necessity of the body
makes a man dependent. Necessity is born only when a man
accepts a thing as his own which is not his. A Karmayogi
does not accept anything as his own and for him, but he
regards it as the world’s and for the world. only. So he has
no necessity. | :
‘Kamana’ (desire) and ‘sprha’ (necessity)—renunciation of
both means that there should not be any desire for things and
there should not be any necessity for the maintenance: of the
body. The reason is that the desire for the maintenance of the
body is also enjoyment of pleasure. Not only this but even
the win for peace, salvation and self-realization is ‘Kamana’
(desire). Therefore real disinterestedness consists in not having
desire even for salvation. | oy
In this verse there is prohibition (negation) of ‘Apara
prakrti’ (lower or insentient nature). The ‘Jiva’ (the embodied
soul) because of egoism has sustained ‘Apara _prakrti’
(universe)—‘yayedarn dharyate jagat’ (Gita 7/5). Therefore by
being free from egoism, the.lower nature is negated (affinity
is renounced) and the self (soul) becomes free from the .
bondage of birth and death. If everything is renounced, even
: then egoism remains (persists) but if egoism is renounced,
. everything is renounced. __ |

esa brahmi sthitih partha nainam prapya vimuhyati

sthitvasyamantakale'pi |= brahmanirvanamrcchati

O Partha, such is the state of a God-realized soul. Having
attained this state, he overcomes delusion. Being established in
this state, even at the hour of death, he attains brahmic bliss
(identification with the absolute state). 72 |
Comment:— “

‘Esa brahmi sthitih partha'—This is the Brahmi state viz.,
the state of a God-realized soul. On being free from egoism,
individuality is completely wiped out and then a striver is
automatically established in God. Individuality persisted only
due to affinity with the world. With renunciation of affinity
individuality is completely gone. The term ‘Esa’ refers to ‘very
near’. It denotes the expressions 'vihaya kaman' (giving up desires),
‘nihsprhah' (free from thirst for necessities), ‘nirmamah' (free from
the sense of mine) and ‘nirahankarah' (free from egoism), used
in the preceding verse.

Having heard the Lord's declaration—""When your intellect
transcends the mire of delusion and confusion, by hearing
conflicting doctrines, you will. realize union with God"",
Arjuna was inquisitive to know about that state of union
with God. So Arjuna, raised four questions, in order to know
the marks of a man of steadfast wisdom. Having answered
those four questions, the Lord declares here that this is a
state of Godhood (union with God). In this state of eternal
union with God, no individuality remains, only the Divinity ©
pervades. In order to point out this important fact the Lord
addresses Arjuna as ‘Partha’ here. So
"
283,"240 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
'Nainam prapya vimuhyati'—So long as, a man _ has
egoism (the feeling of 'I') in the body, he is deluded. Lack
of discrimination between the real and the unreal, is delusion.
The man's self being real, if he identifies himself with the
unreal; this identification is delusion. When a striver knows
the unreal as unreal, his affinity to it ceases* and he realizes
that he is already established in the real. With this realization
he is never deluded (Gita 4/35).
""Sthitvasyamantak4le'pi brahmanirvanamrcchati'—The human
body has been bestowed upon man, only for God-realization. So
the Lord gives an opportunity, even to vilest sinner, to attain
Him by establishing himself in Him, even at the time of death
viz., by breaking off his affinity with matter. Lord Krsna has
also anounced it, in the thirtieth verse of the seventh chapter,
“One who knows My integral being, comprising Adhibhuta
(the field of matter), Adhidaiva (Brahma) and Adhiyajiia (the
unmanifest Divinity) even at the time of death, attains Me.""
Similarly, He has also announced in the fifth verse of the
eighth chapter, ""He who departs from this body, thinking of
Me alone, even at the time of death, attains Me; there is no
doubt about it.” |
By the above expression, the Lord declares the glory of
this Brahmi state (Godhood). By being established in this
state, even at the time of death, one attains Brahma. As the
Lord declared about equanimity that even a little practice of
it protects one from great fear (of birth and death) (2/40), so
He declares here that 1f one gets established in this Brahmi
state, even at the time of death by breaking off his affinity
with matter, he attains Brahma. Attachment to matter (non-
* By knowing the unreal as unreal, a man becomes free from it, because in
fact the unreal has no existence. The unreal seems to exist in the light of the real.
If a person does not become free from the unreal even after knowing it as unreal,
it proves that he has not actually known it.
"
284,"Verse 72] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI _ 241
self), is the only obstacle to the attainment of this state. If a
person renounces the attachment, even at the time of death,
he realizes his real axiomatic state of Godhood. |

Now, a question arises, how a man who could not attain
God throughout his life, attains Him at the time of death, when
his body and intellect both grow weak. The answer is that man's
union with Him is natural, only he has to realize this fact* and
this can be realized, either by God's or saints’ grace or by good
influences of past actions.

The word ‘api’ (even) means, that during life if he attains |
a state of Godhood (Brahmi state) he becomes a liberated soul.
| But, even at the time of death if he becomes free from a sense
of mine and egoism, he attains Him immediately without any
sort of practice, meditation and trance etc.

By using the terms 'Brahmanirvanam' (Oneness with Brahma),
Lord Krsna means to say, that the striver of the Discipline
of Disinterested Action (Karmayoga), . attains the same
Brahma as striver of the Discipline of Knowledge (Jianayoga)
(Gita 5/24—26). The same fact has been pointed out, in the
fifth verse of the fifth chapter when he declares, ""The supreme ©
state which is attained by a Sankhyayogi (the follower of the
Discipline of Knowledge), 1s attained also by the Karmayog! (the
follower of the Discipline of Disinterested Action).

—_

Man himself is sentient but he accepts his affinity for
the insentient. Therefore, instead of attaining salvation or
God-realization, he goes to ruin. By using his discrimination
he aims to attain God, while out of delusion he wants to have
affinity to the Matter. : —

Delusion is born of egoism, and a sense of mine or
desire. To accept the body as 'T' or ‘Mine’ is, delusion born |
of egoism, a sense of mine, while the wish to acquire or
"
285,"242 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA - [Chapter2
preserve something, is the delusion born of desire. Arjuna .
like other worldly people, had delusion born of egoism and

~ a sense of mine, as well as desire. In the sentence used in
the first chapter—'We who are righteous persons clearly see
the sin,’ is an example of delusion, born of egoism; ‘These
kinsmen will be destroyed"", is that of delusion born of the
sense of mine and ‘We should not fight otherwise, we shall
incur sin and go to hell’, is that born of desire. :

To remove this delusion, Lord Krsna has talked about two
kinds of discrimination—discrimination between the real and the
unreal (2/11—30) and discrimination between discharging one's
duty and abandoning it (2/31—53).

While discriminating between the body and the soul, Lord
Krsna explained, that there was never a time when he or those
kings were non-existent nor they would cease to exist in future.
It is a fact that these bodies did not exist before, nor will they
exist in future and in the interim also, they are changing every
moment, as every born one passes through babyhood, youth and
old age: He also explained, that as a man discarding worn-out
clothes, takes new. ones, likewise, the embodied soul, casting
off worn-out bodies, enters into others, which.are new. So he
should not grieve.

While explaining discrimination between discharging

: one's duty and abandoning it, He said, ""There is nothing more
welcome for a man of the warrior class, than a righteous war,
which is an open gateway to heaven; if you do not wage it,
you will incur sin. But if you fight treating pleasure and pain,

| gain and loss, victory and defeat, alike, you will not incur sin.
Your right is to perform your duty, but never to its fruit. Let
not the fruit of action, be your object, nor let your attachment
be, to inaction. Therefore, perform your duty being fixed in
Yoga, because equanimity consists in remaining even-minded,
in success and failure. A man who, endowed with equanimity
"
286,"Verse 72] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 243
performs his duty, becomes free from virtues and vices in his
— lifetime. When your intellect transcends the mire of delusion,
and the confusion by hearing conflicting statements, it becomes
poised and firmly fixed, in meditation (on God), you will attain
union with God."" : - |
Appendix—tThe striver devoid of the sense of mine and
egoism gets dissociated from the material world called as ‘Asat
division’ and realizes his natural owner abidance in Brahma
i.e., Sat division. This abidance is known as ‘Brahmi sthiti’.
Having attained this state no owner of this body remains, in
other words there is none who assumes this body as ‘I’ or
‘mine’ and individuality is wiped out. It means that our reality
is not dependent on egoism. Even rid of egoism ever Reality
stands which is called “Brahmi sthiti’ or ‘abidance in Brahma’.
Once this ‘Brahmi sthiti’ (eternal union) is realized, then a man
never gets deluded (Gita 4/35). If even at the time of death,
being free from the sense of mine and egoism, he realizes this
‘Brahmi sthiti’ (state of Godhood), he attains brahmic bliss
(identification with the absolute state) immediately.
By being free from the sense of mine and egoism, Brahma
(the Absolute) or enlightenment is attained. Then a man becomes
free from the sense of mine, from desire and from doership.
The reason is that the embodied soul has sustained the universe
because of egoism—‘ahankaravimidhatma kartahamiti manyate’
_ (Gita 3/27), ‘Jivabhiitaia mahabaho yayedam dharyate jagat’
(Gita 7/5). If he renounces egoism, the universe will not
exist any more. Having attained the Absolute (af he has the
latencies or impressions of devotion), he will know God in —
entirety naturally because the universal soul is the support
of Brahma. . ,
Nothing is mine—by accepting this truth, a man becomes
free from the sense of mine. I need nothing—by accepting this
fact, a man becomes free from the interested motive. I have
"
287,"244 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
to do nothing for myself—by. accepting it, a man becomes
free from .egoism. -

Third Chapter |
INTRODUCTION

The teaching of Gita is based on man's experience. While
starting this gospel, (from 2/11), Lord Krsna first of all clarifies
that the body and the soul are totally different from each other.
The body is transitory, unreal, limited and perishable, while the
soul is eternal, real, omnipresent and imperishable. Therefore,
one should neither feel sad at the destruction of the perishable
nor should have a desire to maintain the imperishable—this is

| called discrimination. This discrimination is very essential in
all the three disciplines of Action, Knowledge and Devotion.
When a man discriminates the self from the body, the desire
for salvation is aroused. Not to speak of salvation even the
desire for heaven etc., is aroused, when a man regards his own
self as different from the body. Therefore, the Lord starts His
gospel with discrimination.

This topic of discrimination, begins with the eleventh verse
of the second chapter and continues upto the thirtieth verse.
The Lord, instead of using philosophical terminology, has used
simple terms to enable people to understand the topic easily. It
means, that every person deserves God-realization because the
human body has been bestowed upon us, only to realize Him. So,
every human being can realize God, by giving due importance,
to discrimination. |

For this topic, even the term 'intellect', has not been used
by the Lord. In order to distinguish the real from the unreal,

_ the imperishable from the perishable, the eternal from the
transitory and the soul (spirit) from the body, there is, need
only for discrimination rather than intellect. Discrimination is
beyond intellect. As prakrti (nature) and Purusa (spirit) both
are without beginning (Gita 13/19), so is discrimination, which
"
291,"248 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA | [Chapter3
distinguishes, the real from the unreal. This discrimination has
been bestowed upon all creatures by. God, and it is revealed in
the intellect. Birds and beasts, also know what should or should
not be eaten. Even trees and creepering plants feel hot and cold
and experience favourable and unfavourable circumstances. Human
beings, are specially endowed with this discrimination, which
can release them from the bondage of birth and death and leads
them, to eternal quietude and bliss. _ |

When this discrimination is aroused i.e., when a man can
distinguish between the spirit and the body, his affinity for the
world, including senses, mind and intellect, is renounced and
his intellect, becomes purified and equanimous. -

In the Discipline of Action the resolute intellect is single
(Gita 2/41).* When a man firmly resolves that he has to attain
salvation, favourable or unfavourable circumstances are no obstacle
and thus he attains equanimity, without making any effort.
When a man resolves to attain God-realization, his attachment
and attraction for the world begins to disappear. Attachment to
pleasure and prosperity, is the main obstacle to the attainment
of a resolute intellect (Gita 2/44).

Having laid emphasis on resolute intellect, in the Discipline
of Action, the Lord asks Arjuna, specially to perform his duty
with equanimity. He declares, ""You have a right to action
alone, but never at all to its fruit"" (2/47); ""Perform your duty
being steadfast in Yoga” (2/48) viz., equanimity. The Lord also
declares, ""Far inferior to the Yoga of wisdom, is action"" (2/49)

| i.e., action performed for its fruit, is far inferior to the Yoga of
wisdom (equanimity). He further declares, ""Seek thou refuge

* In the Discipline of Knowledge there is predominance of discrimination,
in the Discipline of Devotion there is predominance of reverence and faith while -
in the Discipline of Action there is predominance of resolute intellect. But it does
not mean that in the Discipline of Action there are no discrimination, reverence
and faith. What it means is that resolute intellect predominates. Similarly in the
Disciplines of Knowledge and Devotion also there is resolute intellect.

in equanimity."" Then He declares, ""Endowed with wisdom
(evenness of mind), one casts off during this life both good
and evil deeds; therefore devote thyself to Yoga; Yoga 1s skill
in action"" (2/50). : = | | /

_ Arjuna had already made up his mind not to fight. So in the
thirty-first verse of the first chapter, he said, ""I do not foresee
any good in slaying my kith and kin."" Then in the forty-fifth
verse, he says, ""What a great sin have we decided to commit,
by preparing ourselves to slay our own people!"" In the fifth
verse of the second chapter, Arjuna says, “It 1s better to live by
begging, than to slay these honoured teachers (elders).” In the third
verse of the second chapter, Lord Krsna directs Arjuna to arise,
shaking off his petty faint-heartedness, while Arjuna declared his
determination not to fight in the ninth verse of the second chapter.
_ Listener cannot understand what a preacher preaches, if he is
already full of prejudice. That is why, Arjuna could not have a
thorough grasp of the topic explained to him, by Lord Krsna.

He could not make out the real meaning of Lord Krsna's
words. These appeared to him to be ambiguous and confusing.
So Arjuna puts questions to Lord Krsna in the next two verses,
in order to get his doubt cleared. |

_ If you think that knowledge is superior to action, O Janardana

KeSava (Krsna)? With your complex words You seem to bewilder

may attain the highest good. 1-2
Comment:—

__ ‘Janardana'—By this term Arjuna means to suggest, that as
God fulfils desires of His devotees He will undoubtedly fulfil
his desire also. _ a |

‘Jyayasi cetkarmanaste mata buddhirjanardana _tatkim
karmani ghore mam niyojayasi keSava'—Its a common human
: weakness, that one puts queries to others with a view to getting
a response, which would support his own views. It is cowardice,
because valour consists in carrying out the instructions of the
preacher whether these are, favourable or hostile. It is because
of this weakness or cowardice, that he experiences difficulty in
, unfavourable circumstances. When he finds himself unable to
face the unfavourable circumstances, he disguises himself as a
good man 1.e., the evil masquerades itself as a virtue. It is very
difficult to renounce this sort of evil. In the case of Arjuna also,
the evil of the renunciation of his duty has disguised itself as a
virtue of non-violence. So, he regards knowledge as superior to
action and’ asks Lord Krsna, why he urges him to do a savage
deed, of fighting. _

- The Lord, in the thirty-ninth verse of the second chapter,
referred to equanimity (evenness of mind), but Arjuna took it to
be, knowledge. Therefore, he tells the Lord, that He had already
told him, ""This, which has been taught to thee, is wisdom
concerning Sankhyayoga (Discipline of Knowledge); but now
listen to wisdom concerning Karmayoga (Discipline of Action);
endowed with which, thou shalt cast off the bondage of action.""
He had also told him, ""Action is far inferior to the Discipline of
"
294,"Verse 1-2] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 251
Wisdom (Knowledge)"" (2/49). Thus, if according to the Lord,
knowledge is superior to action, He should not urge him to be
engaged, even in virtuous actions such as oblation, charity and
penance etc., which are sanctioned by scripture. But still, He is
urging him to do the savage deed of the slaughter of warriors,
in the war. Why? a

First, Arjuna, filled with enthusiasm, ordered Lord Krsna
to place his chariot between the two armies so that he could
observe the warriors, eager for battle. But, when Lord Krsna,

having placed the chariot between the two armies, in front of
Bhisma and Drona and other kings, asked Arjuna to behold those
Kurus assembled there, his delusion, because of his attachment
to his kinsmen, was aroused. So he thought, knowledge to be
superior to action, as in the case of knowledge a man has not
to perform such savage deeds as the slaughter of warriors in a
war. So Arjuna asks Lord Krsna, why he urges him to perform
such a savage deed. , :

Here the term ‘'Buddhth’ has been taken in the sense of
knowledge, otherwise he would not have put this question. If
Arjuna had understood ‘equanimity’ by the term 'Buddhih’, then
the Lord's statement would have not appeared as confusing.
The reason is, that the Lord, in the forty-eighth verse of the

- second chapter, had already asked him to perform action being
steadfast in equanimity. Using the term ‘confusing words' will
be purposeful only, when there might have been two contentions
in the mind of Arjuna and only then this question might arise,
""If you consider knowledge superior to action, then why do you
urge Me to take savage action?"" In the third chapter in response
to Arjuna's question, Lord Krsna declares, that in this world
there are two disciplines—the Discipline of Knowledge and the
Discipline of Action. It means, that Arjuna took the meaning of
the term ‘'Buddhih’', to be knowledge.

A striver can receive the correct answer to his question,
"
295,"252 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
only if he puts it with faith and reverence. Arjuna has full faith
in Lord Krsna and holds him in great reverence. Therefore, his
question shows, that he is even prepared to perform the savage
deed of fighting, in order to attain salvation. .

""Vyamisreneva vakyena buddhirn mohayasiva me'—Arjuna says,
that. sometimes he asks him to perform his duty (2/48) while

‘another time He asks him to seek refuge in knowledge (2/49).
Thus, with an seemingly mixed words, He seems to bewilder his
mind i.e., Arjuna is not able to understand whether he should
perform his duty or take refuge in knowledge.

Here, the use of the term ‘eva’ (as it were) two times,

| . shows Arjuna's reverence for Lord Krsna. It is because of this
reverence for the Lord, that he regards the utterance of the Lord

as true, thinking that He is not confusing him. But because of

his own lack of understanding, the Lord's utterance seems to

him to be perplexing and it bewilders his mind. Had the Lord

‘in fact bewildered his mind, then who would have removed
his delusion? |
- ‘Yadekam vada niscitya yena Sreyo'hamapnuyam'—Arjuna

_ requests Lord Krsna to tell him decisively, one principle either
.of action or of knowledge, by which he may attain the highest

good or bliss. Arjuna is repeating the same request which he had
already mentioned, ""Tell me decisively what is good for me (2/7).
- Appendix—So long as we accept (assume) the existence of
the world, an action seems dreadful or pleasant. The reason is
that by cognising the entity of the world, we have our eye on

an action rather than on our duty. But when we mind our duty,
_ ‘the action does not seem dreadful or pleasant.

: Link:—The Lord, in the next three (third, fourth and
fifth) verses, answers the complex words said, in the first
two verses.

The blessed Lord said:

O sinless Arjuna, in this world to achieve equanimity a twofold
path has been enunciated by Me before, the path of Knowledge,
for men of renunciation (Sankhyayogi), and the path of Action,
for men of action (Karmayog!). 3
Comment:—

[Arjuna did not want to fight. So he misunderstood the
term 'Buddhi' (intellect), which stands for equanimity but he
took it to mean knowledge. But the Lord had already used the
terms 'Buddhi' and 'Buddhiyoga' for equanimity (2/39, 49 etc.)
Therefore, here also Lord Krsna is describing equanimity
which can be acquired by both the Disciplines of Knowledge
and Action.]

'Anagha'—The question put by Aquna, how to attain on the
highest good or bliss, shows his freedom from sin, because the
keen desire to attain bliss, destroys all the sins of a striver.

'Loke'smindvividha nistha pura proktaé maya'—Here, the
term 'loke’' denotes human body, because both the Disciplines of
Knowledge and Action can be practised, only in human hie.

The term 'Nistha’ stands for equanimity, which can be attained
either through the Discipline of Knowledge or the Discipline of ,
Action. In order to distinguish the two, the Lord, in the thirty-
ninth verse of the second chapter, declared, ""This is equanimity
concerning Sankhya, which has been taught to you (from the
eleventh to the thirtieth verses). Now listen about equanimity
"
297,"254 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 3
concerning Yoga (Discipline of Action) (from the thirty-ninth
to the fifty-third verses)."" - | : :

The term ‘pura’ also denotes ""time immemorial"", as well as,
the immediate past. Here it has been used in the latter sense L.e.,
in the preceding chapter, when doubt arose in Arjuna’s mind.
In both the disciplines which have already been described in
the preceding chapter, there is no mention of the renunciation
of actions.

Here, Lord Krsna has mentioned two disciplines—the
Discipline of Sankhya (Knowledge) and the Discipline of Yoga

, (Action). Corresponding to the two types of Disciplines there

are two types of ‘purusas’, in this world (Gita 15/16). These are,
the perishable (mortal world) and the imperishable (immortal
self). To remain equanimous in success and failure, gain and
loss of the perishable is known as the Discipline of Action,
while having a disinclination for the perishable and being
established in the imperishable is the Discipline of Knowledge.
But above these two there is the Supreme Person who is beyond
the perishable, and is superior to the imperishable, as described
in the scriptures, and the Veda (15/18). Thus a wholehearted
surrender to the Lord, is called the Discipline of Devotion.
Therefore, in the Discipline of Action there is predominance of the
perishable, in the Discipline of Knowledge there is predominance
of the imperishable, while in the Discipline of Devotion there is
predominance of God (Supreme Person).*

The state of 'nistha’ (equanimity), can be attained by strivers,
either through knowledge or through Action, but identification

* In fact in both Karmayoga and Jijanayoga our relation with God remains
established. God Himself has prescribed these disciplines (Yogas), forthe salvation
of man. The strivers following these two disciplines carry out the rules prescribed
by God. The only thing is that the striver following these two disciplines does not
totally depend upon God.
"
298,"Verse 3] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 255
with the Lord, is not their own (nistha). In Sankhya state strivers
experience distinctly, the existence of their own selves, as well
as, that of the world and try to cut asunder the affinity for the
world. A Karmayog! offers to the world, everything (including
even his body), that he has derived from it and removes affinity
from the world. In this way, both of them get established in
their true form—the Self. But in the state of wholehearted
surrender to God, a striver in the beginning, does not feel the
existence of God, but he believes that there exists something
unique (God) which is above and apart from the Self, as well
as, the world. Thus he accepts God with a firm belief and faith
and dedicates himself to Him. Therefore, in Sankhya and Yoga,
there is predominance of ‘knowing’ whereas, ‘accepting’ (Faith)
is of much import in Bhagavannistha. :

There is no difference between 'knowing' and ‘accepting’.
‘Accepting’ is equally indubitable (firm) as ‘knowing’. There
is no scope for a debate for an accepted thing. A child takes
its mother to be its own. No doubt ever crops up in its mind.
Therefore, mm Gita, wherever the term ‘knowing’ has been used
with reference to Bhaktiyoga, it should be taken as ‘accepting’.
Similarly, in connection with Jnanayoga and Karmayoga, the
term ‘accepting’ should be taken to mean ‘knowing’. :

The state of equanimity depends on the disciplines of the
Jnanayogi and Karmayogi, but in Bhagavannistha the devotee
depends entirely, on the grace of God. |

The Discipline of Devotion has been described in the
Gita time and again. In this chapter also, the Lord having
described the Disciplines of Knowledge and Action, explains,
the Discipline of Devotion in the thirtieth verse, by declaring,
""Surrender all actions to Me."" Similarly, in the fifth chapter
also, having described the two Disciplines, in the tenth verse,
He declares, ""The knower of Truth performs actions offering
these to God,"" while, at the end of the chapter, He declares
"
299,"256 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
that He is the enjoyer of sacrifices and austerities and so on.

‘Ji€nayogena sankhyanam'—These are modes of nature,
(prakrti), which act on the modes (Gita 3/28) and so a striver,
is not related to them. Thus, by thinking so, when a striver
renounces the agency of doership in all actions it is known as,
the Discipline of Knowledge (Jnanayoga). : :

_ At the beginning of the gospel of the Gita while describing
Sankhyayoga (the Discipline of Knowledge), the Lord clarifies,
the imperishable self from the perishable body, by terming these
as ‘sat’ (real) and ‘asat' (unreal) (Gita 2/16). _

'Karmayogena yoginam'—The Discipline of Action, consists
in performing one's duty according to one's caste, stage of life,
nature, circumstances, according to the ordinance of the scriptures,
renouncing attachment to it and desire for its fruit, and remaining
equanimous in success and failure. '

The Lord has primarily described the Discipline of Action, in
the forty-seventh and forty-eighth verses of the second chapter.
In the forty-seventh verse, there is mention of the principle of
the Discipline of Action, while in the forty-eighth verse, there
is description of the method of performing action.

Appendix—Karmayoga and Jnanayoga—These two paths
being in the world are worldly—‘loke’smindvividha nistha’.
In Karmayoga there is predominance of ‘Ksara’ (perishable)
(world) while in Jnanayoga there is predominance of ‘Aksara’
(embodied soul) (imperishable).. The perishable and the
imperishable also are there in the world only—‘dvavimau purusau
loke ksarasScaksara eva ca’ (Gita 15/16). Therefore Karmayoga |
and Jnanayoga—both are worldly paths.

By attaching importance to the soul (Self) and the world—
there are two paths. If without attaching importance to the soul
and the world, importance is attached only to God, there are
not two paths but there is only one unworldly path of
‘Bhagavannistha’ (devotion).
"
300,"Verse 4] : SADHAKA-SANJIVANT. 257
In worldly paths (Karmayoga-Jnanayoga) a striver’s endeavour
is important. In practising. the spiritual discipline a striver
holds that his effort is predominant. But when a striver practises
spiritual discipline by depending on God without considering his
effort as dominant, then his path is unworldly (divine). The reason
is that by being connected with God all becomes unworldly.
Unless and until there is affinity for God, all is worldly.

- Neither think others as evil doers, nor wish evil to others
nor do evil to others—with this outlook “Karmayoga’ begins.
Nothing is mine, I need nothing and I have to do nothing for
myself—by accepting this truth ‘Jnanayoga’ begins.

Not by non-performance of actions, does a man attain freedom
from the bondage of actions; nor by mere renunciation, does he
attain perfection. 4 |
Comment:— | |

'Na karmanamanarambhannaiskarmyam puruso'snute’'—
In the Discipline of Action, performance of action 1s inevitable,
because for a sage who wishes to attain success in Yoga, action
is the means (6/3).* ,

A man has an impulse for action, which can be pacified
by the performance of actions, without having any desire for
fruits. If a striver performs actions having a desire for fruits,
this impulse is not pacified, it is rather enhanced.

‘Naiskarmyam asnute'—When a striver performs his duty, |

* If he does not perform action, how will he come to know whether he
remained equanimous in success and failure or not? :
"
301,"258 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
without any desire for fruit, he attains to the state of actionlessness
1.e., he is released from the bondage of action. Such actions do
not bear fruit, in the same way as a roasted or boiled seed loses
its potence to sprout. Such actions lose their power of involving
a man, in the bondage of birth and death. oe

A man can renounce desire, when he perform actions only
for the welfare of others, as actions have affinity for the world,
while the affinity of self is, for God. So long as he performs
actions for himself, he cannot renounce desire and as long as
he does not renounce desire, he cannot attain to the state of
actionlessness. |

| ""Na ca sannyasanadeva siddhim samadhigacchati'— In the first
half of this verse, the Lord has declared that a Karmayogi does not
attain the state of actionlessness by non-performance ‘of actions.
In the second half, He declares that a Sankhyayogi (a follower
of the Discipline of Knowledge) does not attain perfection viz.,
a state of actionlessness by mere renunciation of action.

It is necessary for a striver to renounce the sense of doership,
in order to attain perfection. So a Sankhyayogi (follower of the
Discipline of Knowledge) instead of renouncing the performance
of action, must renounce egoism. |

In Sankhyayoga, actions can be performed and they can also
be renounced to a certain extent, but in Karmayoga (Discipline
of Action), action is necessary as, it is the means to attain success
in Yoga viz., perfection (Gita 6/3). :

The Gita, teaches a man, how to attain spiritual perfection by
performing one’s duty. It inspires him to perform actions, rather
than to renounce them. So the Lord lays emphasis, on performing
actions, in both the Disciplines of Action and Knowledge.

It is natural that when a striver aims at salvation, he gets
tired of the worldly affairs and wants to renounce those affairs.
"
302,"Verse 4] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI — 259
Similarly, Arjuna also being tired of actions, asks Lord Krsna why
He is urging him to be engaged in this terrible action of waging

__ war, when both the Disciplines of Action and Knowledge lead
to equanimity. But the Lord, orders Arjuna to perform actions in
both the Disciplines. By the Discipline of Action, He orders him
to perform action by being even-minded (Gita 2/48), while in
the Discipline of Knowledge He orders him to fight (Gita 2/18).
Therefore, the Lord urges people to perform actions rather than
to renounce these. But the Lord asks them to renounce desire
and attachment which are like poison, in actions. —

A striver instead of renouncing the performance of actions,
should renounce his attachment to them. Yogis (men of action),
having abandoned attachment, perform actions only by the body,
mind, intellect or merely by the senses, in order to render service to
the world, without any selfish motive (Gita 5/11). In the Discipline
of Knowledge, there is predominance of discrimination, between
the real and the unreal. Therefore, a Jfianayogi assumes that it
is modes which are acting on the modes 1.e., all the actions are
performed by the body, senses, mind and intellect etc., while he
does nothing at all (Gita 3/28, 5/8-9).

All strivers experience that as soon as, a keen desire for
salvation 1s aroused in them, they have disinclination for actions,
things and persons (members of the family). But being attached
to a body, they have a desire for rest, which is an obstacle to
their progress. Generally, strivers believe, that they can progress
in the spiritual field by renouncing actions, things and company
of people. But the fact is, that renouncement of attachment to
actions, things and people is an important factor. In the Discipline
of Knowledge, it is difficult to renounce attachment, without
keen dispassion. But in the Discipline of Action, attachment is
easily renounced, by performing actions for others, even without |
keen dispassion.

In the Gita, it is also mentioned that a striver may practise
"
303,"260 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
spiritual discipline in solitude. But in solitude, a sattvika (virtuous)
person devotes his time, in being busy with spiritual practice and
adoration, a rajasa (passionate) person spends it in projections
and distractions, while a tamasa (ignorant) man, wastes it in
sleep, indolence and heedlessness. Therefore, a striver should
have an inclination to dwell in solitude, in order to devote his
time and energy to spiritual activities, but he should perform his
mundane duty also, very promptly without being attached to it. He
should be attached, neither to people nor to inaction. Detachment
leads a striver to salvation very quickly. In fact external solitude
is ‘not the real solitude, because the body is also a fragment
of the world. Therefore, real solitude consists in renouncing
affinity with the body and the world i.e., in renouncing egoism
and attachment.

Appendix—The divinity which is ours, is in us and is now, is
not realized by doing something because that 1s never unattained.
We shall do some action, then that reality will be realized—this
conception strengthens identification of the self with the body.
Every action has a beginning and an end, therefore by action
only the thing will be gained which does not really exist. But
because of affinity for Prakrti in every being, there is an inner
urge for actions which does not enable him to be actionless. In
order to pacify this urge, it is inevitable not to do what ought
not to be done, and do without the sense of mine and with
disinterest what ought to be done viz., not to do any action for
oneself but do only for the welfare of others. By doing actions
for oneself, the impetus for actions will never end because
the self is eternal while actions are transitory. Therefore by
performing actions selflessly for the welfare of others, the urge
for actions calms down, affinity for Prakrti gets renounced
and God, Who pervades everywhere and every time will be
revealed and realized.

na hi kascitksanamapi jatu tisthatyakarmakrt
karyate hyavasah karma sarvah prakrtijairgunaih
For, no one under any circumstances can remain even for a

moment, without undertaking action; everyone is compelled to act,

by the modes born of nature (prakrti). 5

Comment:—

'Na hi kaScitksanamapi jatu tisthatyakarmakrt'—In the
Disciplines of Action, Knowledge and Devotion, no striver can
ever remain without performing actions. Hence the terms 'Kascit'
(anyone), 'ksanam' (a moment) and ‘jatu' (verily) are uncommon.
Here, the term 'kaScit' denotes, that no one whether he is wise or
ignorant, can remain without performing action. Though a wise
man may have no relation with his so-called body, yet actions
are constantly performed by it. The term ‘ksanam' denotes, that a
man does not assume that he performs actions constantly, but he
cannot remain without performing action, even for a moment, so
long as he assumes his affinity for the body. The term ‘jatu’ means
that a man cannot remain without performing action, in any state
such as wakefulness, sleep, sound sleep and unconsciousness.
The Lord explains the reason by the term 'avagah' (helplessly)
in the second half of the verse, by declaring that he has to act
helplessly by impulses born of nature. Nature is ever changeful.
A striver has to do nothing for himself. He has to perform actions
sanctioned by the scriptures, for the welfare of others. So far as
forbidden actions are concerned, they cannot be performed by a
striver, because his aim 1s God-realization.

Many people regard, only those actions as actions, which
are performed by the gross body. But according to the Gita, the
activities undertaken by the body, speech or mind are also regarded
as actions (Gita 18/15). And those actions, whether physical or
"
305,"262 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
mental to which a man is attached, lead him to bondage.

Generally, people regard their professions, such as business,
service or teaching and nursing of children etc., as actions, but they
do not consider eating, drinking, sleeping, waking and thinking
etc., as actions. So, when they renounce their profession, they
think that they are not performing actions. But it is a serious error
on their part. All the activities performed by the physical body,
for the purpose of earning a living, actions performed by the
subtle body like sleeping and thinking and in trance, performed
by the causal body, are all regarded as actions. So long as, a
man has ego and sense of mineness with the body, the activities

| performed by body are actions as the body is an evolute of
nature and nature is never inactive. So, a person having egoism
and attachment to the body, cannot remain without performing
action, in either of the states, either of activity or inactivity.

""Karyate hyavaSah karma sarvah prakrtijairgunaih'— Everyone
is made to act helplessly, by the modes of nature (prakrti)
because nature and its modes are ever active (Gita 3/27, 13/29).
Though, the soul is inactive, detached, imperishable, uniform
and unconnected, yet so long as, it being attached to nature
and its evolute—the gross, subtle and causal bodies wants to
derive pleasure and remains helpless under the control of nature
(Gita 14/5). This helplessness of the self, under the control of
nature, is due to affinity with nature. This has also been mentioned,
in the eighth verse of the ninth chapter and the nineteenth verse
of the eighth chapter..

Individual nature is moulded by tendencies and tendencies
are born of modes and modes in their term evolve from prakrti.
Therefore, to be subjected to nature or modes or prakrti is one
and the same thing. As a matter of fact, subjection to the prakrti
and its evolutes, is the root-cause of all bondage. The same,
on different occasions, has been defined as subjection to time,
nature, action and prakrti etc. So long as, the self (soul) does
"
306,"Verse 5] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI . 263
not become free from nature and its modes i.e., does not realize
God, it remains helpless under the control of modes, time, nature,
pleasures and even persons, property etc. But when it transcends
the modes of nature and realizes the self or God, it does not
remain helpless, it attains freedom which is axiomatic.

There are two states of prakrti—active (gross) and inactive
(subtle). Performance of action, is the active state, while remaining
idle in sleep etc., is the inactive state. But, even in the inactive
state nature does not remain inactive, and activity goes on, in its
subtle form. When a person is awakened by someone, he says
that he was aroused, in half sleep. This proves, that the process
of sleep continued even, in the inactive state. In the same way,
activity continues in a trance, dissolution (pralaya) and final
dissolution etc., in its subtle form.

In fact nature never remains inactive because it is ever-
changing. In the self (spirit or soul) there is no doership, but
having assumed Its affinity for bodies etc., the evolutes of nature,
It becomes helpless, under the control of nature. It is because
of helplessness, that though, being a non-doer, assumes Itself,
as doer. All the actions of the universe, such as seeing, hearing,
breathing, digestion of food etc., are performed by nature. So is
the case with the states of childhood and youth. But the embodied
soul, is bound by regarding itself as the doer of some actions.

Nature constantly undergoes changes, while in the purer self
there 1s never any change. In fact, the worldly things have no
existence of their own. The kaleidoscopic heap, seems to exist in |
the form of things. When a man assumes his affinity for things,
he cannot remain without performing actions, even for a moment
in any state. If a striver realizes that all the activities are confined
to the things and he has not the least relation with them, then
only can he get rid of his helplessness. A Karmayogi (follower |
"
307,"264 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
of the Discipline of Action) gets rid of this helplessness by
renouncing the desire and attachment to the ever-changing things.

Whatever has been said, by the Lord here in‘this verse, has
also been said, in the eleventh verse of the eighteenth chapter
when He declares, ""It is indeed impossible for an embodied
being, to abstain from actions altogether.""

Appendix—All actions are performed only in Prakrti. But
a man by accepting his identity with nature (prakrti) becomes
dependent on the modes of nature—‘avasah’ and he’ gets
contaminated by actions. Therefore no person who assumes
his affinity with nature, under any circumstances, can remain
even for a moment without undertaking action in any state
as wakefulness, sleep, sound sleep, faint, trance, creation-new
creation, dissolution and final dissolution etc.

How is an action performed in the states of sound sleep,
faint and trance? When a man sleeps and any person awakes him
in between, he says that he was awakened without having a full

| (complete) sleep. It proves that at the time of sleep, the action
from incompletion to completion was going on. Similarly in faint
and trance also an action goes on. In Patanjala Yogadarsana this
action has been called ‘parinama’.* Parinama means current of
variation viz., flow of change.T It means that from the beginning
of trance to the state of relapse, an action goes on. If there is
no action, there can’t be relapse from the state of trance. At

“What is ‘parinama’?—the change of the state from the original (existing)
one to the other new one is ‘parinama’.

(Yogadarsana Vibhiti 13, Vyasa Bhasya)
"
308,"Verse 6] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 265 :
the time of trance there is ‘parinama’.and at the end of trance
there is relapse. ,

‘Sahajavastha’ or ‘Sahaja Samadhi’ (natural state of self-
realization) transcends all states of Prakrti. In it there is no action
in the least, an action is not possible. Therefore in Sahajavastha
there is neither ‘parinama’ (current of change) nor vyutthana
(relapse). The reason 1s that activities take place only in Prakrti
and its evolutes, never in the self. ‘Karyate hyavasah karma’—-We
are helplessly driven to action, but we are quite free in having
or not having attachment or aversion for them.

| Link:— In the fifth verse, it has been mentioned that no one
can remain without action for a moment, even, one may object
to these that a person could regard himself as free from action,
by forcibly suspending the functions of the senses. The answer

He who while, restraining the organs of action, thinks of sense-
objects in his mind, he, of deluded understanding is a hypocrite. 6
Comment:— — | |

""Karmendriyani samyamya ya aste manasa smaran indriyarthan-
vimiidhatma mithyacarah sa ucyate'— Here the term 'Karmendriyani'
does not stand only for the five organs of action (speech, hand,
foot, anus and generative organ) but also stands for the five sense-
organs (ear, skin, eye, taste and nose) because actions cannot be |
performed by the organs of action alone without sense-organs.
Besides this if only the organs of action such as hand and foot
etc., are restrained but the sense-organs such as ear and eye are
"
309,"266 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
not restrained hypocrisy is not fully proved. — |

In the Gita, sense-organs have also been included within the
organs of action.Therefore, in the Gita only the term 'Karmendrtya’
rather than 'Jianendriya’ has been used. In the eighth and ninth
verses of the fifth chapter the actions of the sense-organs such
as seeing, hearing and touching etc., have also been innumerated
along with actions of the organs of action. It proves, that in the
Gita, the sense-organs are also included, in the organs of action.
According to the Gita, the activities performed with the mind,
are also included in actions (Gita 18/15). It means, that every
evolute of nature 1s active, because nature is ever-active.

Though the term 'sarnyamya’ means full control over senses,
yet here it signifies, only their outward restraint. The reason
is, that he who has completely controlled his senses, cannot be
called a hypocrite.

A man of foolish understanding (who cannot distinguish the
real, from the unreal) restrains the senses forcibly, from running
after sense-objects but thinks of the objects of enjoyment, with
his mind and assumes this state, as actionless. Such a person is
called a hypocrite. The reason is, that outwardly he has restrained
the organs and senses, but because of egoism, attachment and
desire, he performs action by enjoying pleasure, while thinking
of the objects of enjoyment.

Worldly pleasures can be enjoyed externally, as well as
internally. As external pleasures leave their influence, so do
the internal ones, which are enjoyed by thinking of the objects
of enjoyment viz., by being attached to them. External pleasures
can be renounced by applying discrimination, thinking of adverse
consequences or to maintain social decorum. But, there is no such
obstacle, in the enjoyment of internal pleasures. A person goes
on enjoying these with his mind, and develops a false pride that
he has renounced these pleasures. Thus, internal pleasures prove
very fatal for him. Therefore, a striver should very carefully
"
310,"Verse 6] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 267
restrain his mind from thinking of the objects of enjoyment.

Arjuna also wants to renounce the performance of actions, and
asks Lord Krsna why He urges him to engage in the terrible deed.
In response to his question the Lord replies, that a person who,
having renounced the actions externally, has egoism, attachment
and desire etc., but thinks that he is not performing any action,
is a hypocrite. It means that striver instead of renouncing the
performance of actions, should perform them promptly, renouncing
desire and attachment. _ oo

Appendix—Worldly pleasures can be enjoyed externally as
well as internally by mind. Enjoyment of pleasures physically
and relishing them by thinking of sense-objects—there is no
difference between the two.

The same impression is made by dwelling on sense-objects
in the mind as it is made by physical enjoyment of pleasures.
If one relishes the memory of pleasures, then several years may
pass but that pleasure remains the same (fresh). Therefore the
thought of pleasure gives birth to a new pleasure. Not only this
but relish of pleasures, by thinking of them, causes greater harm.
The reason is that a man can renounce external pleasures in order
to escape adverse public opinion and to maintain social decorum,
but in the enjoyment of pleasures with the mind there is no such
external obstacle. Therefore a man gets a good chance to enjoy
them with the mind. So relishing pleasures with the mind is very
harmful for a striver. In fact renunciation of pleasures mentally
is the real renunciation (Gita 2/64).

DOSES I

Link:—In the fourth verse, the Lord laid emphasis on the
performance of actions, in both the Disciplines of Action and
Knowledge. In the fifth verse, He declared, ""No one can remain
even for a moment without performing action."" In the sixth verse,
He said, ""He who, restraining the organs of actions forcibly
"
311,"268 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
regards himself as actionless, is a hypocrite."" It means that
renunciation of actions, is not true renunciation. Therefore, He
in the next verse explains the marks of real renunciation.

Comment:—

{The term 'tu' (but) has been used in order to declare that such
a follower of the Discipline of Action, free from attachment, is
superior, not only to a hypocrite, but also to a follower of the
Discipline of Knowledge.] 7

'Arjuna'—The term ‘Arjuna’ means, pure in nature. The Lord
addressing him as Arjuna, says that being pure in nature, he
should have no doubt about the performance of his duty.

'Yastvindriyani manasa niyamya'—-Here the term 'Manasa,
stands for all the inner senses—(mind, intellect, faculty of reflection
and ego) and the term ‘Indriyani’ denotes, all the ten organs of
action and sense-organs. ‘Controlling the senses by the mind’
means that by applying discrimination a striver should realize
that the self has no affinity for the senses and the mind. When
the senses are controlled by the mind, these can be engaged in
or deviated from, any activity as the striver wishes.

Senses are controlled, only when attachment to them is -
renounced totally. In the eleventh verse of the twelfth chapter
also, there is mention of control over senses for a Karmayogi.
It means that a striver can follow the path of action, only by
controlling the senses.
"
312,"Verse 7] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 269
In the preceding (sixth) verse Lord Krsna talked, about a
hypocrite who forcibly restrains his senses, while here in this
verse He is talking of, preventing the senses from indulging
in forbidden actions and engaging these in actions, which are
sanctioned by scriptures. When actions are performed according to
the scriptural injunctions, senses are automatically controlled.

‘Asaktah’'—A man is attached to (1) actions, and (ii) their fruit.
It is attachment, and not actions or their fruit, that is the root of
all evils. Attachment is the main stumbling block to perfection.
So a Striver instead of renouncing actions, should renounce
attachment. He can be free from attachment, when he, without
regarding the body, senses, mind and intellect as his or for him,
starts performing his duty promptly for the welfare of the world,
by considering these of the world and for the world. By doing
so, his attachment to the fruit of actions automatically perishes.

All actions, including thinking and trance, have nothing
to do with the self (Gita 5/11). Though the self is naturally
unattached, yet by developing attachment, it gets attached to the
world. The real merit of a Karmayogi consists in being free from
attachment. Freedom from attachment means, having no desire
for the fruit of actions.

A common man performs actions in order to fulfil his
desire, while a striver performs actions having the aim of
renouncing attachment. Such a striver is called here an
‘Asaktah' (unattached).

A striver following the path of action, can renounce attachment
and desire for fruit, more easily than the striver, who follows
the path of knowledge. A Karmayogi, only through disinterested
actions without any other means, can be free from attachment
and desire for fruit, while a Jnanayogi, in order to do away with
his sense of egoism and attachment, has to follow the path of
action i.e., he has to perform actions without, having any desire
for fruit (5/6, 15/11). The reason is, that unless dispassion 1s
"
313,"270 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3

developed and body consciousness is removed, Sankhyayoga
is difficult to practise, without having practised Karmayoga
beforehand. Through the practice of Karmayoga a Sankhyayogi
gets completely detached, and then through the practice of
Jnanayoga, he attains perfection. As soon as a Karmayogi
renounces attachment, he attains equanimity.Therefore, the Lord
declares, that actions need not be renounced but these should
be performed, without attachment. It is attachment, which needs
to be renounced. In Karmayoga (Discipline of Action), action is
performed for the welfare of others, while 'Yoga’ (union) is for
one's own self. Arjuna considers action in relation to himself,
therefore, he thinks that fighting is a terrible act. So the Lord
clarifies, that it is attachment to action, rather than action, by
itself, which is terrible. .

‘Karmendriyaih karmayogam arabhate'—As the term ‘Indriyani'
stands for all the ten senses, so does the term, 'Karmendriyaih'
denote the ten senses. If they are taken as the five organs of action
alone, such as hand, foot and speech etc., how could actions be
performed without seeing, hearing and thinking? Therefore, all
the internal and external senses and organs, by which actions
are performed, are included in 'Karmendriyaih.' :

When an action is performed, for the welfare of others
without any selfish motive, it is called ‘Karmayoga'’ or the
Discipline (Path) of Action. When a person performs actions
for himself, he is attached to the actions and their fruit. But,
when he performs these for others, actions and their fruit are
related to others, while he is related to God i.e., he realizes his
real relation with God, the eternal. Thus, performance of one's
duty according to one's caste and circumstances etc., selflessly,
is the beginning of Karmayoga (Discipline of Action). —

Strivers following the Discipline of Action are of two
types:—(i) Those who are interested in performing actions, but
their main aim is to attain salvation. Such strivers need not start
"
314,"Verse 7] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI - 271
new actions. They have to make proper use of the available
circumstances. (11) Those who are more interested in rendering
service to others, in providing comfort to others and in improving
the society, than in their attainment of salvation. Such strivers,
can start performing new actions, with the aim of doing away
with their attachment. oe | :

In the Gita, Lord Krsna asks Arjuna to make a proper
use of available circumstances, because Arjuna had a keen
desire to attain the highest good i., to attain bliss or
salvation (Gita 2/7; 3/2; 5/1).

'Sa visisyate'-—He, who performs actions for the welfare of
others, having renounced his selfishness and fruit for action, is
superior as his all actions are directed towards the service of the —
world, All his possessions and body are also, for the service of
others. His selflessness is of such a degree that his ego (of the
sense of rendering service), is completely annihilated. Thus he
becomes totally detached and liberated.

When a striver resolves to attain salvation, he wants to
renounce actions, by regarding these as stumbling blocks to
salvation. But the fact is, that it is not the action but it is the
selfish motive in the performance of actions, which is an obstacle.
Therefore, the Lord declares that a person, who without attachment
performs action for the welfare of others, is superior to those
hypocrites, who restrain the organs of action but have the sense-
objects in mind. Even a person who performs action in order to
receive its reward, such as heaven etc., is superior to a hypocrite.
Then, there is no doubt that a Karmayogi who performs actions
for the welfare of others without having any selfish motive, is
superior. At the beginning of the fifth chapter, Arjuna asks Lord
Krsna to tell him for certain which one of the two, Sannydsa or
Yoga (renunciation of actions or their unselfish performance) is
better. Lord Krsna replies that both lead to salvation, but unselfish
performance of action is better, than its renunciation. Similarly,
"
315,"272 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
here also he declares a Karmayogi, who performs actions, for -
the welfare of others selflessly, to be superior.

Appendix—In a striver if there is eagerness for salvation, |
there is generosity in his nature and there is compassion in

| his heart viz., he gets happy (pleased) with the happiness of

others and becomes sad (compassionate) with the sufferings of
others—a striver having possessed these three traits becomes
eligible for Karmayoga. Being fit for Karmayoga, Karmayoga
is easily practised. -

In Karmayoga there is one division of ‘Karma’ (duty) and
one division is of ‘Yoga’. Proper utilization of one’s things,

| power, ability; and rendering service to people—this is duty. By
discharging one’s duty there is disunion (disconnection) from the
assumed union with the world—this is yoga. Duty has its relation
with the world and yoga has its relation with God.

Link:—In response to Arjuna's question, why the Lord was
urging him to-take such a dreadful action as, warfare, He replied,
""No one can ever remain even, for a moment without performing
action."" ""Then He. explained that he who, restraining the organs
of action, thinks of the sense-objects, is a hypocrite, while. he
who engages himself in action without expecting any reward, is
superior. Now in the next verse, He orders Arjuna to perform
his allotted duty. |

Fad Ge aa at He Pret Wawa: 1

niyatarh kuru karma tvarh karma jyayo hyakarmanah .

Sarirayatrapi ca te na _ prasiddhyedakarmanah

Do perform thy prescribed duty, for action is superior to
inaction. Besides even the maintenance of the body would not be
possible for thee, by inaction. 8
"
316,"Verse 8] “SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 273
Comment:— OO | | :
'‘Niyatarn kuru karma tvam'— A man is permitted to
perform two types of actions—those as laid down in the
scriptures such as, fasts and worship etc., and the allotted duty
according to one's caste, order of life, nature and circumstance,
such as eating food, doing business, construction of a house
and guiding a person who has lost his way and so on. A |
man cannot perform all actions as laid down in the scriptures,
thoroughly. But he can very easily abandon the forbidden
actions; non-performance of prescribed actions is not very
harmful. Abandonment of forbidden actions, such as falsehood,
theft and violence etc., is very beneficial. When he abandons
forbidden actions, actions sanctioned by the scriptures, are
automatically performed by him. |

In the Discipline of Action, action according to one's caste
and sanctioned by the scriptures, is one's allotted duty, whether
it is terrible or mild. Here Lord Krsna explains to Arjuna, that
as a Ksatriya (member of the warrior class) it is his duty to
fight (Gita 18/43). Though the action involves violence and
bloodshed, yet it.is his allotted duty. In the second chapter
also, the Lord told him that having regard for his own duty he
should not falter (Gita (2/31). In fact 'svadharma’ (One's own
duty) and 'niyatakarma’ (allotted duty), both are one and the
same. For Duryodhana being a member of the warrior class, it
was his duty to fight, yet it was not his allotted duty, as being
unjust he wanted to usurp the Pandava's kingdom. For him, it
was not a nghteous and prescribed, duty.

‘Karma jyayo hyakarmanah'—The Lord, in this verse is,
answering the question put in the first verse, by using the
same term 'jyayah' (superior). There, Arjuna put the question
why He was urging him to perform the terrible action of
waging the war, when according to Him knowlédge was superior
to action. In response to his question the Lord declared, a
"
317,"274 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
person following the path of action, to be superior to person,
following the path of inaction. Thus, Arjuna wants to escape
the battle, while the Lord exhorts him to fight, as it is his
allotted duty. Therefore, the Lord in the eighteenth chapter
declares, ""One should not abandon the duty suited to one's
nature, even though it may be easy"" (18/48), because by
abandoning it, one is exposed to sin and one continues to
be attached to it. Therefore, performance of allotted duty, is
superior to renunciation of actions. Performance of actions
without attachment, is far superior to those performed with
attachment, because by doing so, affinity for actions is totally
renounced. Therefore, the Lord in the first half of this verse,
orders Arjuna to perform his allotted duty without attachment,
while in the second half He declares that maintenance of. the
body would not be possible by inaction either.

In the Discipline of Action the Lord's main principle is
""Action is superior to inaction."" The same fact has been pointed
out by the Lord, when he declares, ""Let not thy attachment be to
inaction” (Gita 2/47). The reason is, that he who shirks his duty
wastes his time in heedlessness, laziness and sleep or performs
forbidden actions, which mislead him to a downfall.

It is better to be detached from actions by performing
them, rather than through their non-performance. A person is in
bondage, due to desire, attachment, partiality etc., whether he
performs actions or not. In the path of action, if a striver has the
aim to renounce desire, it can be renounced very easily, through
the performance of action for the good of others.

'Sarirayatrapi ca te na prasiddhyedakarmanah’— Arjuna had a
misconception in his mind, that his affinity for actions would be
automatically renounced, if he did not perform action. Therefore,
Lord Krsna persuades him to perform actions by several pleas,
one of thése was, that even the maintenance of body would not
be possible, by inaction. |
"
318,"Verse 8] ‘SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 275

As in the Discipline of Knowledge, affinity for the world
is renounced by discrimination, in the Discipline of Action,
affinity is renounced by performing one's duty sincerely and
thoroughly. Therefore, the Discipline of Action, should in no
way be regarded as inferior to the Discipline of Knowledge. |
A Karmayogi, regarding the body as belonging to the world,
uses it in rendering service to the world i.e., he has no sense of
‘mineness', with it. He identifies the physical, subtle and causal
bodies respectively, with the gross, subtle and causal world, while
a Jiianayogi identifies himself with Brahma, the Absolute. Thus
a Karmayogi, identifies the insentient elements while a Jianayogi,
identifies the sentient ones. | |

Generally strivers such as Arjuna, commit an error, that they
insist on non-performance of actions. Secondly, while practising
spiritual discipline they want favourable circumstances, so that
they may attain their aim quickly. But such a desire, is a stumbling
block to their spiritual progress.

A striver who wants to attain bliss easily and quickly, is
a pleasure-seeker rather than a striver, because by doing so he
has an eye, not on the spiritual discipline but on its fruit. The
result is, that he gets tired of spiritual discipline and thus attains
his aim late. A striver, who has a single-minded determination
to attain bliss, is bent upon practising the spiritual discipline,
whole-heartedly without thinking of the difficulties, duration,
pleasure and pain. Not to talk of a striver, even a greedy
merchant bears all hardships, without caring for hunger and
thirst etc., as long as customers continue to come and there
is a good sale. Similarly, a striver practises spiritual discipline
with reverence and devotion, without caring for comfort and
even the bare necessities of life. He has a keen desire to attain
his object. He bemoans if he finds himself unable to overcome
any obstacle in the path of spiritual discipline, while a striver,
"
319,"276 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
who derives pleasure out of the spiritual discipline, gets angry
when he finds an obstacle, in his way. The curiosity or desire _
' Of a striver enhances every moment, while the latter thinks of
- relaxing, having attained the aim quickly. The former thinks that
| he has nothing to do, except practising the spiritual discipline
under all circumstances. So he applies his full power and attains
bliss. But the latter, when he does not succeed quickly, may get
disappointed. Therefore, a striver should attach more importance
to the means, rather than to the end, like Goddess Parvati who
in the Ramacaritamanasa declares, ""I have a firm determination
that I shall marry only Lord Siva, otherwise I shall remain
unmarried even though millions of births may pass. I shall not
disobey the preaching of sage Narada, even if Lord Siva may
ask me to do so, a hundred times"" (1/81/5). Mother Parvati is
not time-conscious, in her penance. |

In this verse, Lord Krsna through Arjuna urges all strivers
to perform their allotted duties very promptly, by renouncing the
desire for favourable circumstances and pleasures, which are the
main stumbling blocks to spiritual progress.

Appendix—A Karmayogi, who performs actions in a
disinterested way, is not only superior to those who do not
perform action or to those who do actions in an interested
manner but is also superior to a ‘Jnanayogr —‘“Tayostu karma
sannyasatkarmayogo visisyate’ (Gita 5/2). Therefore the Lord
here is laying special emphasis on the performance of actions
in a disinterested way.

POLES AD

Link:—In the preceding verse, Lord Krsna declared that
without performing action we cannot keep body and soul together.
It proves that performance of action is essential. But actions lead
to attachment and bondage. So how can a man be free from this
bondage? The Lord, answers the question in the next verse.
"

The mankind is bound by actions other than those done for —

the sake of sacrifice. Therefore, O son of Kunti (Arjuna), perform
action for that (yajiia) sake, and without attachment. 9 |
Comment:—

. ""Yajiarthatkarmano'nyatra'—According to the Gita, every oe
duty is 'Yajiia' (sacrifice). The term ""Yajiia’ includes sacrifice,
charity, penance, oblation, pilgrimage, fast, study ofthe Vedas
and all physical, mundane and spiritual actions. Professions such
as business, service and teaching etc., sanctioned by the scriptures,
are also included in ""Yajna’. Other actions, which are performed
in order to comfort others and for the welfare of others, are also
included in the term ""Yajfia’. Attachment perishes very quickly
by performing actions for the sake of sacrifice and all actions
of a Karmayogi are dissolved (Gita 4/23) 1.e., they instead of |
leading the person to bondage, reduce the stock of his past
actions also to nothing. :

In fact; a man's inclination is judged by his aim, rather than |
by his actions. As a businessman's aim while having a transaction
is to earn money, and he thinks of money, as soon as he shut
his shop, similarly, a striver who performs action for the sake
of sacrifice, has the aim of God-realization and as soon as the
action is over, he is inclined towards God.
The people of different Varnas (castes) have their allotted
duties and actions. A Brahmana (a member of the priest class)
can depend on charity which is a source of his living, while it -
is not allowed for a Ksatriya (a member of the warrior class).
Similarly, performance of actions without having any desire for
fruit, is a man's own duty while performance of actions expecting
"
321,"278 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA — [Chapter 3
_ their fruit is not his own duty. Similarly, forbidden actions are also
not included in one's own duty, and so is the case, with actions
which are performed in order to gain pleasure, honour, praise
and comfort etc.* Therefore, a striver should take precaution lest
the action should be performed with a selfish motive. In fact a
striver is he, who is ever on the alert in this regard.
| If a person receives a visitor with open arms, in order to
create a good impression of his gentleness upon him, it means that
the action has been performed, with a selfish motive. Therefore,
| such an action cannot be called a sacrifice. Similarly, if a person
puts a question to an orator in a meeting or in a discourse in
order to impress the orator and the audience, his action is not
performed for the sake of sacrifice (Yajfia). It means that a striver
should perform action by renouncing his selfish motive and desire.

A striver should not take. any action for pleasure and
prosperity, or even for the maintenance of the body. If actions
are performed for the maintenance of body, it means that there
is a desire to live. Actions should be performed for the sake

_ Of sacrifice alone. Any action taken for personal welfare, leads
: to bondage. Indeed, the supreme striver is he who performs
actions for the welfare of others, even without having a desire
to attain salvation. The welfare of others also involves one's own
welfare. Therefore, all the mundane and spiritual actions should

be performed, for the welfare of others.

Action which is performed for one's own self, leads to
bondage. Therefore, even actions such as remembrance, reflection,
meditation and even a trance should be practised for the welfare.
of the world. Thus whatever a striver does with his physical,
subtle and causal bodies, does only for others, not for himself.
By doing so, his affinity for the world is renounced and he is

'  * When a-man performs actions for himself, it means that he has a desire
for the fruit of actions and where there is desire for the fruit of actions, there is
the possibility of the performance of forbidden actions.

united with God. This is known as Karmayoga. -
'Loko'yarh karmabandhanah'— Only human beings are entitled
to take action in the form of performing a duty (sacrifice), as ,
has been described by the Lord relating to the topic, of the
wheel of creation (3/14—16). He who performs actions with
an interested motive is bound, while he, who performs actions, |
for the welfare of others, performs his duty and attains liberation
from bondage. It is not action but attachment and selfishness, ,
which bind him. -
""Tadartham karma kaunteya muktasangah samacara'—Here |
the term '‘muktasangah' (freedom from attachment) denotes, that
actions should be performed without entertaining the feeling of ,
‘mine’, and attachment to actions, things, body, mind and intellect |
etc. If the feeling of 'mine' and attachment are renounced, actions
are automatically performed for the welfare of others, and if a
striver has no other actions to perform, he automatically gets
established in the self. Consequently, only actions which are
prescribed by the scriptures, are performed by him.
The renunciation of duty out of indolence and carelessness,
is declared to be ""Tamas’ (Gita 18/7) which results in delusion
i.e., such a person is born in the wombs of the deluded. He who
abandons a duty, because it is painful, such relinquishment is
Rajas (Gita 18/8) the fruit is pain (Gita 14/16). Therefore, here
Lord Krsna does not exhort Arjuna to renounce actions but He
orders him to perform actions efficiently and enthusiastically
renouncing selfishness, mineness, attachment, desire for fruit and :
partiality etc., according to the ordinance of the scriptures. Such ,
relinquishment is regarded 'Sattvika' (Gita 18/9). The Lord Himself |
further declares that there is nothing in the three worlds that
must be done by Him, yet He is engaged in action (3/22-23).
A person becomes slack in performing actions because of
two factors—(1) It is in the nature of human beings that they
perform action with a view to reaping the fruit. But when,
"
323,"280 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
according to the Discipline of Action, he realizes that actions
are to be. performed without the desire for fruit, he thinks why
he should perform actions at. all. (2) If having started action, he
realizes that it will bear adverse fruit, he feels that he should
not perform it) = st | oo
A Karmayogi has neither any desire nor expectation of the

perishable fruit of action, he performs actions, only in order to —
do good to the world. So there cannot be any slackness in the
performance of duty. : -

| Generally, a person does an act promptly and efficiently,
only if it serves his selfish motive, but such an action binds
him. In order to be free from the bondage, he should perform
actions prescribed by the scriptures, disinterestedly.

: In the Discipline of Action, all actions are performed for
others. Who are others? Not only other beings and things, but the
so-called our own bodies—gross, subtle, (senses, mind, intellect
and life-breath) and causal (including 'ego') are also, included in
the term 'others’*. The reason is, that the self (soul) is a fragment
of sentient God, while these bodies and things are the fragments
of insentient 'prakrti' (matter). All actions are performed through
the evolutes of nature such as body etc., and for the body and
the world which are also evolutes of nature, while the sentient
neither undergoes actions, nor are actions performed for the |
sentient. So actions can never be performed for the self. But
. * Like the world the body, senses, mind and intellect are also different from
us. Therefore, a Karmayogi without assuming them as his own, serves them.

| ' He does not let the body become sleepy, indolent, heedless, idle and pleasure-
seeking. Thus he renders service to the body. He renders service to the senses
by not allowing them to be engaged in worldly pleasures. He renders service
to the mind by not allowing it to think of doing harm to others or thinking of _
sense-objects or futile things. He serves the intellect by not allowing it to think

_ of the duties of others. He serves all of them by having neither the feeling of
mineness nor attachment. |
"
324,"Verse 9]: . SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 281
when the self assumes worldly insentient things, such .as a body
etc., as ‘I’, 'Mine' and ‘for me’, he performs actions for himself.
By performing actions for others, attachment and the feeling of
‘mine’ perish easily. | | ,

Everybody can realize that the states of the body (childhood,
youth etc.,) undergo change; but he remains the same.’ This
unchanging self (soul) has its identity with God, while the
changing body, senses, mind and intellect etc., have their identity,

with the world. Whatever action is performed by us, is performed
with body and senses etc., not by the self. This shows that we
have nothing to do for ourselves, we have to do only for the |
world. When we perform actions for ourselves, we are bound by
those actions—""The man is bound by actions, other than those
performed for the sake of sacrifice (Yajfia).""

The imperishable and unchanging self, has no affinity for
the perishable and changing body, senses, mind and intellect etc.
Therefore, there is nothing one's own and for one's own self.
We can do nothing without the help of the body etc., therefore
we have to do nothing for the self. The self can never lack
anything. Without want there can arise no desire. Therefore, It
needs nothing for Itself. In this way, when a man's affinity for
actions and things is severed, if he is inclined towards knowledge,
he realizes the self. On the other hand, if he is inclined towards
devotion, he attains to the state of exclusive devotion.

Appendix—-A man is not bound by performing actions but
he is bound by ‘anyatra karma’ viz., actions which are done
with a selfish motive (for himself) (Gita 3/13). Therefore the
expression ‘yajnarthatkarmano’ nyatra loko’ yarn karmabandhanah’
means—nothing is to be done for one’s own self. ,

A man can be free from the bondage of actions only when
he renders service to the world with the body, things, ability
and strength (power) which he has received from the world and
covets no fruit. The reason is that the world can’t provide us
"
325,"282 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA - [Chapter3
the thing which we aim at. We want bliss, want immortality,
want carefreedom, want fearlessness, want independence (self-

| dependence). But all this will not be available to us from. the
world but it will be available by snapping off our ties with the
world. In order to get dissociated with the world, it is necessary
that whatever we have received from the world, we surrender it
to the world in its selfless service.

Link:—The Lord in the preceding verse declared, ""The man
is bound by actions, other than those performed for the sake of
sacrifice."" Therefore, in order to be free from bondage, actions
instead of being renounced, should be performed, only in the
spirit of performing a duty (yajna). The Lord confirms the same

| fact, by giving other reasons in the next three verses.

Comment:— |

'Sahayajfiiah prajah srstva purovaca prajapatih'—One, who
creates beings or things etc., it becomes his duty to preserve
"
326,"Verse 10-11] - SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 283
them. Brahma is the creator and Lord of creation and so he
always thinks of the preservation and salvation of creation. Thus,
he is known as 'Prajapati’ (The Lord of creation).

At the beginning of creation Brahma, the creator, created man
by providing him with power for performing actions and also
bestowed upon him discrimination.* The right use of desirable |
and undesirable circumstances, leads to salvation. Therefore, the
creator bestowed upon mankind discrimination, tn order to enable
them to make the right use of the favourable and unfavourable
circumstances.

Beasts, birds and trees etc., even without having the power
of discrimination, naturally do good to others; but by God's
grace, special power of discrimination has been bestowed upon
mankind. So if a man does not perform forbidden actions, by
attaching importance to his discrimination, naturally actions for
the welfare of others are performed by him.

Though the term 'praja’ (creation) stands for gods, sages,
manes, mankind and other beings (beasts, birds and trees etc.,) yet
mankind is particularly, responsible to rear all beings. Therefore,
here the term 'prajah' stands for mankind.

The Discipline of Action (Karmayoga) has been functioning
from time immemorial. In the third verse of the fourth chapter,
also the Lord by the term ‘puratanah' declares that the same
ancient Yoga has been taught to Arjuna by Him, which was
lost to the world by a long lapse of time. The same fact has
been pointed out here in this verse, in a different way by the
term ‘pura’ (at the beginning) by declaring, ""Not only I, but also |
Brahmi, at the beginning of creation, having created men ordered
them to follow the Discipline of Action.” It means that, this
Discipline of Action has been going on from time immemorial. :
It is nothing new. , |

_ * Brahma, the creator creates mankind under the instruction of God and with
His power. So in fact God is the real creator of creation (Gita 4/13;17/23).
"
327,": 284 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
In the fourth chapter (from the twenty-fourth to the thirtieth
verses), all the sacrifices for God-realization through wealth,

_ austerities, Yoga (spiritual exercise), vital force etc., have been
described. Generally the term ‘yajiia’ is taken as oblation, or sacrifice.
But in the Gita, the term stands for all the prescribed actions as
laid down in the scriptures. All the duties performed according to
one’s caste, order of life, religion, nature, time and circumstances
etc., are included in the term ‘yajna’. Actions performed for the
welfare of others, are also included in yajiia (sacrifice). It
is a man's responsibility, to perform such a sacrifice (duty).

‘Anena prasavisyadhvamesa vo'stvistakamadhuk'— Brahma,
the creator says to mankind, ""By the performance of duty shall

you propagate and by doing so'you shall get all the requisites
necessary for performing your duty.""

Arjuna was not willing to. perform his duty. Therefore,
Lord Krsna says to him that he should learn the lesson of
performing his duty, from the creator's words. By performing
his duty for the welfare of others, he would progress here, as
well as hereafter.

Performance of actions in a disinterested way, leads to
salvation, while performance with a selfish motive, leads to
bondage. Here, is explained the topic of performance of duty,

| without having any desire for fruit. Therefore, the term ‘istakama'
does not stand for the desired material, it stands for the required
material for sacrifice (duty).* -

* Inthe preceding verse Lord Krsna declared, ""The world is bound by actions
other than those performed for the sake of sacrifice 1.e., by actions performed with

the desire for fruit."" Further in the thirteenth verse He declares, ""Those sinful ones
who cook food for their own sake i.e., perform actions for fruit, verily eat sin.""
Thus in the preceding as well as the next verse there is mention of renunciation
. of the desire for fruit. So in the middle verses (tenth, eleventh and twelfth) also
it should be interpreted ‘as the renunciation of the desire for fruit. If the meaning
of the term ‘Istakama' is taken as the desire for fruit, it does not fit this context,
as such actions lead to bondage. So the term stands for the required material for
sacrifice (performance of duty). —
"
328,"Verse 10-11] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 285

A Karmayog! (the follower of the Discipline of Action), is
ever ready to render service or do good to others. Therefore,
according to the ordinance of Brahma, the creator, such a
Karmayogi does not Jack the required capacity and material for
rendering service to others, and for the maintenance of his body.
All this required material is easily available to him. According
to the ordinance of Brahma everybody has been offered this
material, in order to enable him to perform his duty.

In fact, this human body has not been bestowed upon human
beings to enjoy pleasures (Manasa 7/44/1). Therefore, there is
no mention in anyone of the scriptures, that man should enjoy
worldly pleasures. Society also does not permit a person to enjoy
pleasures freely. On the other hand the scriptures, as well as,
society urge a man to bring comfort to others and to do good
to them. It is mentioned in the scriptures, that a father should
foster his son, but it is not mentioned that he is authorized to
expect service from his son. Similar is the case with others, such
as a son and a wife etc.

A Karmayogi always wants to give but not to receive,
because the desire for fruit, besides being a stumbling block
to salvation, is an obstacle to receiving worldly things. This is
everybody's experience, that no one wants to offer anything to a
person who hankers after it. Therefore, Brahma says, that a man
can attain the supreme good (salvation) by performing his duty
in a disinterested manner, without having any desire for reward.

In the expression ‘devanbhavayatanena’ the term ‘deva’
denotes all beings, such as men, gods, sages. and manes etc.,
because the aim of the striver, following the path of action, is |
to nurture every being: So Brahma, the creator orders men to
offer sacrifice, in the form of the performance of duty, in order
to foster and nurture other people for their advancement. Each
man devoted to his own duty, attains perfection viz., salvation
(Gita 18/45). Men are free in the performance of their duty; so
"
329,"286 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
they should make proper use of this freedom.

| 'Te deva bhavayantu vah'— Trees and plants etc., naturally
bear flowers and fruits, but their growth is luxuriant if these are
tended properly. Similarly, a man should perform his duty by
nurturing and fostering the gods by offering worship and service
to them. By doing so, he is sustained by the gods with timely
rain etc. But when he does not perform his duty properly, the
gods do not properly protect and so he has to face calamities,
such as a deluge and drought etc.

‘Parasparam bhavayantah'—This expression should not be
interpreted to mean that we should serve others only, if they

| serve us. It should mean, that we should perform our duty by
serving others, without bothering about of what others do. He,
who cares for the duties of other people, deviates from his own
duty, and has a downfall. Moreover, it is beyond our power
to force anyone, to perform his duty. We have to perform our
duty of fostering others and doing good to them, to the best
of our resources, such as intellect, power, time and material
etc. In that way, our affinity for the insentient (matter), will be
totally renounced.

We have to serve all our relatives, such as parents, wife,
sons, brothers, brother's wives etc., in a disinterested way by
regarding service as our obligatory duty to them according to
the scriptural injunctions. We are born, to repay our debt by
serving, because we are indebted to them. It is an error on
our part, if we expect any reward from them or lay claim to
them. We have to serve all beings, but the first preference
should be given to those kith and kin, who have a claim on
our service.

It is an accepted fact that the body, senses, mind, intellect
and possessions are neither ours nor for us. If we sincerely
perform our respective duties, we will add immensely, to the
welfare of the world.
"
330,"Verse 10-11] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 287
In the Discipline of Action a striver by performing his duty,
safeguards the rights of others. It is the duty of a son to serve
his parents, and the parents have a right to such service.What is
the right of others, is our duty. Therefore, every person should
perform his duty, in order to safeguard the rights of others,
without paying heed to whether they perform their duty or not.
A man deviates from his duty by thinking of the duty of others
and then has a downfall. Nowadays, in families and society at
large, disquietude, conflict, friction and disorder etc., are rampant.
The root cause is, that people demand their rights but they do not
| perform their duty. Therefore, Brahma, the creator preaches to
the gods and men, that it is their duty to do good to each other.
‘Sreyah paramavapsyatha'—Generally people hold that the
statement, that the gods and men by fostering each other, shall
attain the supreme good, is an exaggeration. But in fact, it is
not so. If anyone is doubtful about it, he himself can translate
this principle into practice and see the same result. When the
trust-money is returned to the owner by a person, he has not the
least affinity for that money, similarly when we utilize worldly
things in rendering service to the world, our affinity for the
world and worldly things, is renounced. As soon as, this affinity
is renounced, supreme good is attained. Therefore, it is an error
to take Brahma's word, as an exaggeration.

So long as, a person performs actions for himself, he is bound
by them, and his actions do not come to an end. But when he
does nothing for himself, nothing remains to be done by him
and he does not commit sin, because desire is the root of sins
(Gita 3/37). Therefore, a striver in order to attain supreme good
(salvation), should perform his duty by renouncing attachment and
the desire for fruit, according to the ordinance of the scriptures.
By doing so, attainment of salvation is axiomatic.

Renunciation of one's desire, leads to the welfare of the entire
"
331,"288 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 3
world. He, who enjoys pleasures, being attached to them in order
to satisfy his desire, performs an act of violence (downfall), for
himself as well as for those who lack those materials because
they are sad due to the shortage of those materials. Thus a
pleasure-seeking person cannot escape sins. On the other hand,
one gets peace from those people who follow the spiritual path, as
everyone can lay equal claim to spiritual assets. Thus according
to Brahma, the creator, if a man performs his duty renouncing
desire and attachment, he can attain the supreme good viz.,
salvation, without any doubt.

Here, attainment of the supreme good has been specially
mentioned for human beings, rather than gods. The aim of the
gods is not to attain salvation. But they offer rewards to men,
according to their actions, provide required matter to them for
performing actions and enjoy the reward for their good actions
performed in the past. They do not provide the required matter
disinterestedly. But, when even the vilest sinner can attain salvation;
the gods can also attain salvation if they have a desire to do so.
However generally, their aim is to enjoy the heavenly pleasures,
so they have no desire to attain salvation.

Appendix—-Man alone is qualified for performing new
actions, while eighty-four lac forms of lives, life of gods and
life of beings residing in hells, are the lives to reap the fruit of
their past actions. Men with interested motives go to heaven in
order to enjoy heavenly pleasures. Therefore the gods follow
their responsibility and discharge their duty not disinterestedly.
Therefore eligibility for salvation is only for men.

Salvation is innate while bondage is caused one. Human life
is only to attain salvation. Therefore the person who discharges
his duty, naturally attains salvation—‘paraspararn bhavayantah
Sreyah paramavapsyatha.’ For salvation no new work needs to
be done, but whatever work a man does, if he does it for the
welfare of others, by renouncing selfishness, egoism and the
"
332,"Verse 10-11] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 289
desire for fruit, it will lead him to salvation. Without disinterested
motive, if a man performs his duty, he goes to higher regions
such as heaven etc. The heaven which is attained by performing
grand religious sacrifice, can be attained by a Ksatriya just by
discharging his duty of fighting in a war.

As Brahmaji has told the gods and men to do good to each
other in selfless spirit through their duties, similarly it should
be interpreted that the people of the four Varnas (castes) should
do good to each other. If the people of the four Varnas (social
orders) discharge their duty for the welfare of each other, it will
lead them to salvation.

The entire universe has been created in the manner that there
is nothing (object or action) for one’s ownself but everything
is only for others—‘idarhn brahmane na mama’. For example a
chaste wife is only for her husband, not for herself. A woman’s
organs appeal to a man, not to a woman. Similarly a man’s
organs appeal to a woman, not to a man. A mother’s milk is
only for the child, not for her own self and the child’s activities
are to please the mother, rather than to itself. Parents are for
the good of their offspring and the offspring are for the good
of their parents. The audience is meant for the speaker and the
speaker is meant for the audience. It means that one should
not derive pleasure (comfort) himself but should provide it to
others. The universe has not been created to enjoy pleasures but
to attain salvation.

_ The gods also by renouncing their selfishness, can do good to
others. Therefore among gods also there have been sages such as
Narada etc. Though the Lord’s ordinance does not deprive any-
one of God-realization (salvation) but a man is predominantly
and naturally eligible (qualified) for it.

Here a question may arise that we do good to others but
others instead of doing good to us, do evil to us, then how will
‘parasparam bhavayantah’ be applicable? The answer is that if
"
333,"290 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
we do good to others, others will not. be able to do evil to us.
They will have no power to do evil to us. Even if they do evil
to us, they will repent for it afterwards and will lament for it.
If they do evil to us; there will be many others to do good to
us and to sympathize with us. In fact there is no ordinance
anywhere to do evil to anyone. A man because of aversion does
evil to others. ‘Paraspararn bhavayantah’ (service to each other
selflessly through one’s duty)—this applies to mankind. Without
following it people are suffering pain.

istanbhoganhi vo deva dasyante yajnabhavitah

-tairdattanapradayaibhyo yo bhunkte stena eva sah

Fostered by the sacrifice (yajiia), the gods, will bestow upon
you all the requisite necessary for performing your duty. He who
relishes these, without using these in the service of others, is verily
a thief. 12
Comment:—

'Istanbhoganhi vo deva dasyante yajitabhavitah'—Here the
term 'Istabhoga' does not stand for the desired objects because
in the preceding (eleventh) verse there is mention of attaining
the highest good and this verse in related to that verse. Secondly,
as long as a man has desire, he can't attain the highest good.
So here this term means that the gods will supply him all the
required material for the performance of sacrifice (duty).

Here the expression ""Yajnabhavitah devah' means that the
gods provide the required material to men by regarding it as
their right (responsibility). Men are indebted to them. So they
have to perform sacrifice (duty). -

'Tairdattanapradayaibhyo yo bhunkte'—Brahma used the
"
334,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 291
expression, ""Te devah’ for the gods, because before him, they
were men, not gods. But here the term 'Ebhyah' stands for
neamess. For God, everyone is near Him (Gita 7/26). It proves
that the holy words from Divine lips, begin here.

Here, the term 'Bhunkte' does not stand only for eating, but
for enjoyment of all the objects. (food, clothes, house and money
etc.,) required for the maintenance of a body. |

We owe this body to our parents, and it is they, who have
fostered it. For our knowledge, we are grateful to our preceptors
and sages. The gods have provided us with the material necessary
for the performance of duty. The manes guide us, how to provide
ourselves with comforts. Beasts, birds, trees and creeping vines
etc., sacrifice themselves, in order to provide comfort to others
and do good to them (though they are not aware of it). Thus,
whatever material, strength, ability, rank, authority, wealth and
property we possess, we owe it all, to others. So whatever we
possess, should be devoted to the service of others. 7

The body, senses, mind and intellect etc., are not ours, these
came from the world. So, if we want to enjoy worldly pleasures
by regarding these as our own, they lead us to bondage. But if
we perform our duty by utilizing these in rendering service to
the other people, from whom we have received them, without
expecting any reward, we can get rid of the bondage.

Generally, strivers think that if they render service to the
worldly people, they would be attached to them and would get
entangled in the world. But the Lord's gospel proves, that it is
not service but desire, which leads to bondage. So, it is every
man's duty, like the gods, to serve others and do good to them,
according to his resources. The Lord and gods do not expect
more from him. | :

'‘Stena eva sah'—Here, in the expression ‘Sah stena' (he is a
thief) the purpose of using the singular number is to emphasise
the fact that, he, who without performing his duty, of giving
"
335,"292 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
the required objects (food, water, clothes etc.,) to others, enjoys
them all alone, is a thief.

The person who without repaying the rightful due of others
and enjoys the objects himself, is a thief. Thus a thief is, he who
performs actions with a selfish motive in order to gain honour and
praise etc. Such a person can never gain purity and peace of mind.

This body is neither different nor can be different from the
world, because it is a fragment of the world. Therefore, if a
person assumes the body as his, without accepting the world
as his, this assumption gives birth to pairs of opposites such
as attachment and aversion and also evil propensities such
as pride, individuality and unevenness of mind etc. A striver
following the path of action, gets rid of the pairs of opposites
such as attachment and aversion etc., easily, because whatever
such a striver does, he does for the welfare of the world. He
even practises the spiritual discipline, not for his own salvation,
but for the salvation of the entire world. The reason is, that if
he regards his salvation different from the salvation of others,
it means that he has unevenness of mind, which is a stumbling
block to his spiritual progress. He, who uses the body, senses,
mind and intellect etc., which he has received from the world,
for his selfish motive, 1s dishonest. :

According to Indian culture, a man’s only aim is to attain
salvation. Therefore, Brahma, the creator, at the beginning of
creation, urged men to perform their duty while fostering one
another, without any selfish motive (Gita 3/10).

Members of a family commit an error, that they perform
actions under the influence of desire, mineness, attachment and
selfishness etc. So they have to suffer here, as well as hereafter.
They fall a prey to quarrel, fight, envy and jealousy etc., while
hereafter, they have to reap the adverse fmit of the actions
"
336,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 293
performed by them. When a person serves others in the hope
of reward, he is attached to persons and things. This attachment
leads him to bondage. A selfish man 1s not liked or praised by
anyone. In a family, objects get concealed from a passionate and
pleasure-seeking person. On the other hand, if a person serves
others with all his resources, he attains salvation and is also
praised, honoured, comforted and supplied things, even though he
is unwilling to receive them. A Karmayogi has no desire to win
honour or praise etc., because desires and pleasures bind him.

Desire for pleasure diverts a man from the performance of
duty, and is conducive to his downfall. So a striver, following
the path of action, should always think-of doing good to others

| including the members of his family, without having any pride of
doership. As a mother's milk is meant only for a child, similarly,
whatever material a man possesses, is only for others. Therefore,
a man should not regard his possessions as his own and for
him. The possessions will perish but bondage in the form of
attachment and feeling of mineness will prevail. So the Lord
declares, that he who enjoys the objects, regarding these as his
own, is a thief. .

A man is indebted to the gods, sages, manes, birds beasts,
trees and creeping plants etc., because it is in their nature to
serve him and do good to him. Therefore, five kinds of sacrifice
(for sages, for gods, for creatures, for manes and for men) have
been prescribed in the scriptures. By this fivefold sacrifice (duty),
he can satisfy all of them. Therefore, having shouldered this
responsibility by making use of his freedom, he can attain to
the supreme good. |

The gods etc., do their duty. If men do not perform their
duty, there 1s a commotion not only among the gods but in the
entire universe. Consequently there are natural calamities such
as a deluge, drought, earthquake and famine etc. The Lord in
the Gita (3/23-24) declares, ""If ever, I did not engage Myself
"
337,"294 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
in action, unwearied, men in everyway, would follow My path
and I should be the creator to disordered life as well as, of
destruction of beings"" (Gita 3/23-24). As a whole bullock cart
faces a series of jerks, when even a small portion of a wheel
is damaged, similarly even if a single person deviates from his
duty, he leaves an adverse. effect on the entire universe. On the
contrary, as the recovery of a diseased limb makes the whole
body healthy, similarly the person who performs his duty sincerely
and efficiently, does good to the entire universe.

Brahma, the Creator, ordered both gods and men to perform
their duty. The gods follow a certain code of conduct, but men
ignore it due to their folly. They start laying a claim to the matter,
which has been bestowed upon them for the welfare of others.
Moreover, they have been endowed with freedom, so that by
making proper use. of it, they may be free from the bondage of
actions, in which they have been placed in, since infinity. But,
by misusing that freedom they get attached to actions and their
fruit. Consequently, they get entangled and head for suffering in
numberless future births. Therefore, men should serve all beings
such as God, gods, sages, manes and men etc., with all the
resources and possessions which have been bestowed upon them.

Question:—How will a Karmayogi keep his body and soul
together, if everything is to be utilized in the service of others?

Answer:—In fact this question arises only, when a man
assumes the identity of the self, with the body. A Karmayogi
does not accept his affinity for the body. He regards the body
as the world's and, therefore, serve the world with it. He has
his eyes on the imperishable self, rather than on the perishable
body. Only the person who is mindful of his body, can ask
such a question. so

As long as a person is eager to enjoy worldly pleasures, he
is keen to remain alive and fears: death. A Karmayogi has no
desire for pleasures, all his actions are performed in order to
"
338,"Verse 12} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 295
render service to others, so he does not care, even to live alive.
The question how he will maintain his body, does not arise in
his mind. In fact he who performs his duty, disinterestedly for
the welfare of the world is an asset to the world which provides
for his living. In the domain of God when there is. provision
for the maintenance of the bodies of ordinary creatures, such as
beasts, birds, insects, germs, trees and plants etc., whose lives
are for the good of others, how is it possible that there will be
no provision for the maintenance of the body of the striver who
serves all beings, with all his resources including his body?

The preserver Lord by His grace, has equally bestowed upon
beings the material required for the maintenance of their bodies.
A mother is a living example to prove this fact. The mothers’
breasts, where there is blood in abundance are filled with sweet
and nourishing milk as soon as.a baby is born. Whether it is
through the grace of God or through fate, a man gets the things
necessary for his living. So there is no need to worry about it. In
the domain of God when there is a provision for the maintenance
of the body of even the vilest sinner or a confirmed atheist,
will there not be any provision for maintaining the body of a
Karmayogi ? Therefore, it is futile to raise such a question.

Appendix—The term ‘yajiia bhavitah’ means fostered,
worshipped, enriched by sacrifice. Being in the middle world
the man can foster all living beings who are living in the upper
as well as the lower region. The man has been settled in the
middle region so that he may do good to all. Therefore the man
is qualified (eligible) for attaining salvation.

mankind is not bound by actions, which are performed for the

: yajiiasistasinah santo mucyante  sarvakilbisaih

The righteous who eat the remnants of the sacrifice are released
from all sins; but those sinful ones who cook food for themselves
verily devour sin. 13 : :
Comment:— _ a

'YajiiaSistaSinah santah'—When duties are performed
according to the scriptural injunctions, without any hope of
reward, equanimity (in the form of a remnant of the sacrifice)
is achieved. The main factor in the Discipline of Action is, that
an action is performed only with the material which is received
from the world. Therefore; an action is called ""Yajna' only if
by it selfless service is rendered to the world. After performing
sacrifice (action) the residue. 'Yoga' (Equanimity) is, for oneself.
This 'Yoga' (Equanimity) is the essence which has been called
‘nectar’ in the fourth chapter (4/31). | :

‘Mucyante sarvakilbisaih'—Here the term ‘kilbisaih' means
sins viz., bondage. The Lord has used the adjective, ‘sarva' (all),
which means that having realized equanimity, a man is released
from all bondage. All his actions performed in the past, (as
stored and ripe ones) as well as those performed ones at present,
melt away i.e., are reduced to nothing (Gita 4/23).* When his
actions have been reduced to nothing, he attains to the eternal
Absolute (Gita 4/31).

* When he has no desire, his stored actions of the past disappear. So long
as the body is alive, desirable and undesirable circumstances appear according
to the fortune, but he remains unaffected by them. Thus actions in the form of
fortune also disappear. As far as the actions of the present are concerned, they
are turned into inaction i.e., they don't bear any fruit because they are performed
without any desire for fruit. |
"
340,"Verse 13] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 297

In the ninth verse of this chapter, the Lord declared, “mankind
is bound by actions, other than those, performed for the sake of
sacrifice."" While in the twenty-third verse of the fourth chapter
He declared, ""All the actions of the man who works for the sake
of sacrifice, are dissolved."" The same fact has been pointed out
here, in this verse. It means, that people who realize equanimity,
the remnant of sacrifice, are liberated from all bondage. Not
only the sinful actions, but also the virtuous actions which are
performed, with the hope of fruit, are conducive to bondage. He
who has attained equanimity as remnant of sacrifice, casts away
both good (virtues) and evil (sins) (Gita 2/50).

Now think over the root of bondage. The desire, that
this should happen and that should not happen, is the root of
bondage. Desire is the cause. of all sins (Gita 3/37). So it must
be renounced. |

In fact, desire has no independent existence of its own. It is
born of a feeling of want in the self, while in the self (soul) no
paucity, is ever possible. So the self has no desire. But a man's
self by identifying itself with the unreal body etc., feels the missing
objects for the body, as shortage in him, and thus has a desire for
the unreal. He should realize that he (self) ever remains the same,
while the worldly objects and actions appear and disappear, these
are born and perish. So, how can the perishable fulfil the desire
of the imperishable? Therefore, it is a folly to hanker after those
sense-objects. They cannot make up the deficiency. If a serious
and proper thought, is given to this point, desires can be wiped
out easily.

When a striver renders service with his body and things
etc., without regarding these as his and for him, his affinity with
the body and things etc., is renounced and he realizes the real
self. Then, he feels no want. Such a man is liberated from the
bondage of the world, while he is alive.

""Ye pacantyatmakaranat'—All kind of desire, selfishness,
"
341,"298 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
attachment etc., are included in the expression ‘atmak4ranat'
(for their own sake). The more selfish a man is, the greater a
sinner he is. : oO

Here the term '‘pacanti' denotes, all the mundane actions
such as eating, drinking, walking, sitting and so on. Whatever
action a selfish man performs, either for himself or for others,
performs only for himself. On the other hand, a striver who,
having renounced selfish motives while performing his duty, works
for others only, even when he appears to work for himself. He,
who uses the objects which he has received from the world for
his own enjoyment, actually cooks food for his own sake. It is
a great sin to regard the body, a fragment of the world, as one's
own and for one's own self. But he who without, regarding the
body as his own, supplies necessities such as food, water and
clothes etc., to it, and does not allow it to be lazy, heedless and
pleasure-seeking, renders service to it and becomes free from the
feeling of mineness and attachment to it. |

Man himself, has to reap the fruit of actions performed by
him. But his actions affect the entire world. He who performs
actions for himself, deviates from his duty. That deviation results
in calamities such as famines, epidemics and deaths etc., in a
country. So, it is proper on the part of a man, that he should
do nothing for himself, should regard nothing as his own and
should desire nothing for himself. .

He who expects the perishable fruit of actions, 1s also like
those who cook food, for their own sake. So the Lord in the
first verse of the sixth chapter, declares that a Karmayogi should
perform his allotted duty without depending on the fruit of actions.
When a man totally renounces dependence on the fruit of action,
he does nothing for himself and thus gets estahlished in Yoga.

'Bhuiijate te tvagharh papa'—The Lord condemns the sinful
ones, who perform actions for themselves. Such persons store so
many sins which are not exhausted even after suffering tortures
"
342,"Verse 13] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 299

‘in hells and eighty-four lac forms of lives, but their sinful actions
remain as stored actions (saficita karma). Human life is such a
marvellous field in which, as we sow so shall we reap for many
births to come*. Therefore, a man must resolve not to commit
sins in future i.e., must not perform actions for himself. Such
a resolution. means a great power. The fact is, that all the sins
of a man who resolves to follow the spiritual path, cease to be
committed by him.

Appendix—The body, ability, rank (position), authority,
knowledge and power etc., which a man possesses, have been
obtained and will be lost. Therefore they are not ours and are
not for us, but they are for rendering service to others. Our
Indian culture is summed up in this principle. As all the organs
of the body are for the welfare of the body, so all the people
of the world are for the welfare of the world. A man may be of
any country, guise, Varna (social order), aSrama (stage of life)
etc., may easily attain salvation by rendering service to others
through his actions.

Whatever characteristic we have, is for others, not for us.
If all the people follow this idea, no one will remain bound
but ali will become liberated souls. If you use the things which
you have received from the world is the service of others, what
have you spent of your own? It leads you to salvation free of
cost. Besides this, nothing needs to be done for salvation. We
are responsible to spend only whatever we possess, we have no
responsibility to spend more than that. A man can’t do more than
that. If we spend the things, ability and strength etc., completely
in rendering service, we shall attain complete salvation.

In fact the body is useful only for the world, not for one’s
own self because the body is not for us at all. The body is

needed in order to do some action. If nothing is to be done, then
what is the need of the body? Therefore to do any action for
one’s own self with this body, is a flaw. We can’t do anything
for the self with the thing which we have received, but with
that we can serve the world. The body is a fragment of the
world; therefore whatever will be. done with it, will be only
for the world. The body-senses-mind-intellect can’t go beyond
the world, they can’t be separated from the world. Therefore
performance of actions for one’s own self, is not human nature
but it is demoniac and devilish nature. In fact a man is only a
human being in the real sense, who does actions for the welfare
| of others. He who performs actions for one’s own pleasure, verily
devours sin viz., ever remains sad, while those who work for the
welfare of others, are released from all sins viz., become happy
forever—‘yajiiasistamrtabhujo yanti brahma sanatanam’ (Gita 4/31).

is the son of Prtha (Kunti) who performed her duty even by
suffering troubles throughout her life. So he should also perform |

was not really terrible, it was a sacrifice (duty). He who performs
his duty, follows the wheel of creation, while he who does not
perform his duty, does not follow this cycle.]

‘Iindriyaramah'—Sensual is he, who enjoys the worldly objects _
through his senses, by having desire and being attached to the .
sense-objects. Such a person is inferior even to beasts, because
beasts instead of performing sinful actions, are purified by receiving
the fruit of their sins of the past. But a man committing new
sins, has a downfall and by creating disturbance in the wheel -
of creation, hurts the entire creation. :
'Aghayuh'—The life of such a man 1s sinful, because he who
wants to enjoy sensual pleasures, cannot escape sin. The person -
who hankers after selfishness, pride, pleasures and prosperity,
causes suffering to others and thus he is of a sinful nature. Saint 7
Tulasidasa in the Ramacaritamanasa declares, ""Those who are
malicious, engrossed in adultery, slanderous and hanker after the

of Lord Rama, the wild tribes said, that if they did not steal
anyone's clothes and utensils, it meant that they were rendering
service to Him (Manasa 2/251/2). Similarly, such persons who
do not perform their duty, should not at least disturb the wheel
of creation. By doing so they could render service to creation.
Such a person who does not follow the cycle of creation,

Comment:—

""Yastvatmaratireva syadatmatrptaSca manavah atmanyeva
ca santustastasya'—Here the term ‘tu’ (but) has been used to
differentiate, a person, who has become enlightened having
performed his duty, from the person who does not perform his
duty, as described in the preceding verse.

So long as a person assumes his affinity for the world, he
rejoices in the sensual pleasures, wife, sons and family, remains
"
348,"Verse 17] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 307 ;
satisfied with food and is content in riches. But they cannot
provide him with perfect and lasting rejoicing, satisfaction and

- contentment, because the world is ever-changing, insentient and
perishable while the self is uniform, sentient and imperishable. ~
So how can the self be satisfied and be contented with the world, |
when there is not even the least affinity between the two?

A man cannot take delight in the world constantly. A newly :
married couple take delight in each other but that joy or attraction -
does not continue to exist after the birth of one or two babies.
Sometimes, an old woman is heard saying, about her husband, -
""It is good, if the old man dies."" The satisfaction provided by -
food and riches etc., is momentary and temporary, also.

In fact, the worldly objects cannot provide lasting delight,
satisfaction and contentment to man. If these had provided real _
delight, satisfaction and contentment, man would have never felt
their absence. In the self, delight, satisfaction and contentment
naturally exist because the self is real and the real never ceases -
to be (Gita 2/16). As the real always exists, there is no deficiency
in it and without that no desire is born. So there is no desire _
in the self. But when the self by an error assumes its affinity
with the world, it seeks delight, satisfaction and contentment in
the world, and has a desire for the worldly objects. When one .
desire is satisfied and the second is not born, at that time, he oo
remains free from any desire and that state of freedom provides
him with delight. But, man by error thinks that he has received
delight, satisfaction and contentment by the satisfaction of desire.

Had he got that delight by the satisfaction of desire, that delight

should have continued unabated and there would have been no |
more desire for that object again. In fact, it does not happen

so. When one desire is satisfied, another new desire is born and

the process continues. When one has desire, it means he feels a :
deficiency and when he receives the desired object, he becomes

a slave to it. Thus a man with a desire ever remains sad.
"
349,"308 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3 :

Here, a point needs attention. A striver rightly thinks that
lack of desire is the root of delight, while desire is the root of
sorrows. But the people attached to the world think otherwise.
They think that they get delight in having received objects or ~

_ things and they are, sad without them. If they realize the reality :
like the strivers, they could also get rid of desires.

People, who perform actions with the expectation of fruit,
deserve, to follow the Discipline of Action (Srimadbhagavata
11/20/7). Such people derive joy, satisfaction and contentment /
out of the world. So the Lord, having described such persons who 7
perform actions without the desire, for their fruit declares that
such strivers, unlike the worldly people, are delighted, contented
and satisfied in the self (Gita 2/55).

In fact delight, satisfaction and contentment are not different
from each other, yet they seem to be different, because of a person's ~
affinity for the world. As soon as this affinity is renounced, an
enlightened soul is delighted, satisfied and contented in the self, ;
their difference which seemed to exist, disappears.

The Lord in this verse, has used the terms ‘eva’ (Only) and
'Ca' (And) twice, while further in the eighteenth verse, He has -
used these terms, once. That shows, that a Karmayogi (One who
follows the Discipline of Action) does not suffer a shortage of :
delight, satisfaction and contentment and needs no greater bliss :
than this one (Gita 6/22). Be

'Tasya karyarhn na vidyate'—The aim of the performance
of actions for a man, is to attain salvation or God-realization.

When this aim is achieved by anyone following the Disciplines

of Actions, Knowledge or Devotion, nothing remains to be done,
known and acquired by him and that is the supreme achievement

of a human life.

In the self, there is no shortage. But so long as a man because
of his affinity for the world, feels shortage in him (self) he
performs actions for himself by regarding the body as 'T and
"
350,"Verse 17] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 309 7
‘Mine’. In that case there remains some work which needs to be |
done by him. But when he, instead of performing the actions for
himself, performs them for others, such as body, senses, mind,
intellect, life-breath, parents, wife, sons, family, society, country -
and the world, his affinity for the world 1s renounced. When his :
affinity for the world is completely renounced, nothing remains
to be done by him, because there is no activity then in the self. a
Whatever action is performed, that is performed because of the |
affinity for the world, by worldly things. Therefore, work is to ”
be done by those, who have affinity for the world.
An action is performed, when there is desire to acquire |
something, and desire is born of want. The enlightened souls
have no want, so they have to do nothing.
When through the Discipline of Action, an enlightened soul
is delighted, satisfied and contented in the self, and nothing -
remains to be done, known and acquired by him, he transcends
prescription and prohibition. Though such a God-realized soul,
rises above the ordinance of the scriptures, yet his actions are ;
in accordance with the scriptural injunctions, and these are |
examples for others. .
The expression ""Tasya karyam na vidyate’, does not mean that
no action is performed by that God-realized soul. But it means
that though no work remains to be done by him, actions are |
performed by him, for the welfare of others. As the activities such SO
as lowering and raising of eyelids, breathing and digestion etc.,
go on automatically, similarly, all exemplary activities prescribed
by the scriptures are automatically performed, by the enlightened
soul, (as he has no sense of doership).
Appendix—-A Karmayogi performs all actions with a selfless
motive to serve the world. As the Ganges is worshipped with
Ganges-water; similarly by applying the body, senses, mind,
intellect and ego, which he has received from the world, in
rendering service to the world, the connection with the body
"
351,"310 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 ~
and. the world is snapped off and the Self or Divinity is revealed.
Therefore he takes delight and is gratified and is contented in
the Self alone.

The worldly injunction and prohibition—both are indeed ~
prohibition (negation) because these two can’t last (remain). A ~
Karmayogi having renounced affinity for the world rises above
all prescriptions and prohibitions. “Tasya karyarn na vidyate’ _
(He has no duty to perform).

For him in this world, there is no gain whatsoever, in the

Comment:— | |

'Naiva tasya krtenarthah'—Everyone has a tendency to do ~
some work or the other, for himself. So long as a man has the
tendency to acquire worldly things, some work remains to be |
done by him. He is bound by the desire of acquiring something -
or the other. Performance of duty is inevitable-in order to get ~ = =
rid of that desire. |

Actions are performed in two ways—either in order to
satisfy desire or to get rid of desire. Common men work in order _
to satisfy their desires, while a Karmayogi performs actions, in -
order to get rid of desires. Therefore, an enlightened soul being
free from desire, has not the least affinity for the performance
of duty. Actions are performed by him, automatically without
any selfish motive, for the welfare of the entire creation. _

Such a God-realized soul realizes that all the worldly objects,
"
352,"Verse 18] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 311 oe
body, senses, mind and intellect etc., are not his own, but these |
belong to the world.
So, these should be utilized for the world. This is, because |
no action can be performed without the help of the world. Apart -
from this, matter required for action, is also an offshoot of the oe
world. It is in no way related to one's own self. Therefore, nothing
is ours. The cosmos can never be meant for an individual. Here, an
lies the fault with man, that he tries to utilise the cosmic entity .
for his individual purposes. This generates unrest. If he utilises |
his body, senses, mind, intellect and matter etc., for universal -
use, he can get a state of quietude. This characteristic exists in an ,
accomplished Karmayog!, that all his so-called body, senses, mind, |
intellect and matter etc., are utilised for the service of the entire .
world. Thus, he is totally unconcerned about his bodily activities.
Even then, a great person instinctively performs excellent deeds, -
ideal for the generality of men. Thus, by utilizing these for the |
world, he attains great peace and his actions are exemplary. ;
""Nakrteneha kaScana'—He, who assumes his affinity for the |
body, senses, mind and intellect etc., and remains inclined towards ;
indolence and sloth, does not want to perform actions, because a
he wants to enjoy pleasure which arises from sleep, indolence
and sloth, and which is declared to be of the nature of ignorance oo
(Gita 18/39). But, how can a_ great soul, who transcends even Be
the Sattvika happiness, be inclined towards pleasure, arising Oe
out of ignorance? When he has not even the least affinity
for body etc., how can he be inclined towards indolence and
heedlessness etc.? |
Generally strivers attach importance to actionlessness.
They want to place themselves in trance (Samadhi) and, being
completely unattached with actions, so that no thoughts are left
to act. This is an excellent and useful thing no doubt, but not
"
353,"312 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
as a principle (final truth). Though inaction is superior to action,
yet it is not the goal. a
_ Inclination and abstention, both are within the realm of nature.

Upto the 'Nirvikalpa’ trance, every stage is within the reign of _
prakrti, because deviation is possible even at this stage. Every _
action takes place in prakrti. Even a deviation from trance involves
action and without action such deviation is impossible. Therefore —
like walking, speaking, laughing and hearing etc., sleeping, sitting, _
standing, keeping quiet, fainting and going into a trance, also are
actions. The real essence (conscious self) 1s free from inclination -
and abstention both. The self, is an untainted illuminator of action —
and inaction both. When a person identifies the self with the
body, actions are divided into two classes—performance and
non-performance. But in fact, both of these belong to the same

: class. Till attachment to the body persists, non-performance of ~
an action, is also an action. As 'go' is a verb so ‘stand’ is also a
verb and both involve activity, though in the former the activity _
is clearly seen, while in the latter it is not apparent.

The question of performance or non-performance of actions,
arises only when a man has affinity with a body. Unless such
affinity is there, no action is possible.

An enlightened soul who renounces his total affinity for nature,
and its evolutes, (the insentient matter), realizes the self, which _ |
transcends both activity and non-activity. Therefore, a striver
should renounce his affinity for matter (egoism and attachment to
the body). The self (tattva) ever remains the same, as always.

‘Na casya sarvabhittesu kaScidarthavyapasrayah'—When
a great soul has not the least selfish affinity for a body and _
the world, all his actions are automatically performed for the
welfare of others. As limbs of a body are ever engaged in doing
good for the body, the body (a fragment of the world) of that
enlightened soul, ever remains engaged in doing good to the world.
Moreover, he has not the least pride or desire for fruit or

354,"Verse 18] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 313
selfish motive, like a hand when it washes the face.

In the preceding verse, the Lord declared that there exists
no work that needs to be done by a God-realized soul. In order _
to explain the reason, the Lord mentions three factors—(1) Such a
a soul has no interest in what is done. (2) He has no interest
in what is not done. (3) He does not depend on anything or
creature for any interest of his. |

In fact, the self has no interest in what is done or what is not 0
done and has no affinity with, either any being or thing because ~
no action is performed by the self. All actions are performed, only :
when the self assumes its affinity for nature, and the things born
of nature. Therefore, no action is to be performed for the self.

So long as a man has a desire to do, to acquire and to
live, and he is afraid of death, he has got to perform actions. -
But when he renounces this desire and is not afraid of death,
he has not to perform action, but action (duty) 1s automatically
performed by him. One who is susceptible to deviation from -
duty needs advice.

In the Gita, Lord Krsna explains the marks of a God-realized |
soul according to the Discipline, which they follow as strivers. :
The same description has been given here, in the seventeenth SO
and the eighteenth verses.

The topic of the Discipline of Action, begins from the thirty-
ninth verse of the second chapter, but the gist has been explained
in the forty-seventh verse of the second chapter, when the Lord .
declares it in four stages: —

(1) Thy night is to work only.

(2) Have no desire for its fruit.

(3) Do not be the cause of the fruit of action.

(4) And let thy attachment be not towards inaction. |
"
355,"314 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 ~
, In this verse (3/18) is the description of a God-realized soul,
who has attained perfection through Karmayoga, as described in
the previous verse. Whatever, has been said there, (in 2/47) in the
second and the third point for the striver, the same has been said, -
in the second half of this verse, for the God-realized soul, that ~
he has no affinity for any creature or thing. Similarly, whatever
has been stated in the first and the fourth point for the striver, —
the same has been said, in the first half of this verse for a God- _
realized soul, that he has no interest in what is done or what
is not done. Thus, in the verses seventeenth and eighteenth, the -
description of the marks of a God-realized soul, who has realized
Him, through the Discipline of Action, has been given.

'. According to the Discipline of Action, the eighteenth verse
should. have preceded the seventeenth verse, because when a
God-realized~soul, has. no interest in what is done or what is _
not done, and when he does not depend on any creature for
any interest of his, he gets joy, satisfaction and contentment in .
his own self. But, in the sixteenth verse the Lord declared, ""He
who does not perform his duty, lives in vain."" Therefore, in the _
seventeenth verse by using the expression 'Yah tu' (who but), the
Lord explains that if a God-realized soul, does not perform his |
duty, he does not live in vain, but his life is very useful, as he -
has attained the aim of human life. Therefore, nothing remains _ |
to be done by him. |

_ The state in which nothing remains to be done, can be attained
even by a common man, by performing his duty, efficiently
without expecting any reward, because everyone deserves to
attain Him. The practice of Karmayoga, can be performed in —
all circumstances. The desire for sensual pleasure, is the main
obstacle to the performance of one’s duty. So, if a striver wipes
out this desire for pleasure by serving others, without having

any selfish motive, he can attain supreme peace by getting rid
of all pains, and sorrows of life. As far as the supreme peace
"
356,"Verse 19] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 315
is concerned, everyone is equally deserving, to attain it, while
it is not possible, for everyone to have worldly possessions in
equal share. .
Appendix—In the world ‘performance of action’ and ‘non- .
performance of action’ are related expressions. Therefore ‘I have
to do nothing’—this is also an action. But in Godhood ‘inaction
is natural and automatic. The reason is that the divine entity has
nothing to do with action or inaction. Therefore a God-realized
Karmayogi has neither any relation with a thing, nor with a
person nor with an action—‘yo’ vatisthati nengate’ (Gita 14/23). 7
From his view-point nothing exists except the divinity.

Comment:—
'Tasmadasaktah satatarh karyam karma samacara'—The term
‘Tasmat’ (therefore) has been used to connect the preceding verse
with this verse. In the preceding verse, the Lord declared that
actions are performed by a God-realized soul, for the welfare
of others though there is no need for him to perform these.
Therefore, the Lord uses the term ‘tasmat', to make Arjuna to
realize God, by performing his duty without expecting any
reward. The reason is, that the self has no interest in what is
done or what is not done. Actions are ever performed for others,
"
357,"316 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 ~
not for the self. When a striver performs actions for others, his
attachment to perform actions disappears, and he gets established
in the self. He is attached to them, when he thinks ""I am body"", _
""The body is mine” and regards the perishable objects such as _
body etc., as significant. : /

It is attachment, not action, which leads to one's downfall.
Being attached to the body, senses, mind, intellect and other |
mundane objects etc., a man performs actions, in order to derive -
pleasure out of them. This attachment for the materialistic objects
etc., leads him to the cycle of birth and death. The Lord declares, ~

""Attachment to the modes born of nature, is the cause of the
birth of soul in good and evil wombs"" (Gita 13/21). When a
striver performs actions without attachment, his affinity for the
insentient (matter) is renounced. -

All actions of a striver who performs them, being free from
attachment, are automatically for the welfare of all creatures,

: while the person who is attached to mundane objects and actions ~
etc., cannot do good to others. _

So far, we have used mundane materials such as a body etc., -
for our own pleasure and prosperity. Therefore, we are indebted
to the world. We can repay our debt by performing our duty for
the welfare of the world. When we perform action for ourselves, -
instead of being free from debt, we run into debt, more and more. -
Therefore, we have to take birth in the world again and again,
in order to free ourselves of debt. By performing actions for
the welfare of others, we get out of the old debt and we cease
to run into new debt, as we perform actions in a disinterested
way. Thus, we are liberated from bondage. /

An action cannot be performed constantly, but attachment
remains constant. So the Lord by the expression ""Satatarn asaktah""
urges Arjuna, to be constantly free from attachment. A striver,
should perform his duty, prescribed by the scriptures constantly
without attachment. In fact attachment also does not remain
"
358,"Verse 19] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 317 |

constant. Even when the world itself is not constant, 1t 1s ever-

changing how can its attachment remain constant? In spite of that,

in the assumed ego, attachment seems to be there, constantly. _
‘Karyam' viz., duty is that, which can be done and must be .

done. In other words, duty is action, which must be performed for

the welfare of others, according to the ordinance of the scriptures

and according to one’s capacity, by renouncing one's selfish motive.

In this way, duty is linked to the welfare of others. : -
Everyone has the freedom and capability to perform one's

duty. It can be performed very easily. But it 1s because of -

heedlessness, indolence and desire for fruit, that its performance

seems difficult. A man can perform his duty, independently under

all circumstances. Attachment perishes through the performance

of duty, while it enhances through the non-performance of duty. _

By performing duty for the welfare of others, we get rid of our

present attachment and by not expecting any reward from them

get rid of future attachment. -
The term 'samacara’ means, that the duty must be performed

very carefully, enthusiastically, promptly and duly, so that the -

aim may be attained. If there is the least dereliction of duty, it

creates a great hurdle in the path, of a Karmayogi. A man's duty

according to his caste, order of life, nature and circumstances :

prescribed by the scriptures is 'sahaja karma’ (innate duty). One -

should not give up one's innate duty, even though it may have

flaws (Gita 18/48), because by doing so, one does not incur sin

(Gita 18/47). So, the Lord seems to urge Arjuna, to perform his

innate duty of waging war, because he is a Ksatriya (a member

of the warrior class), even though the act may seem terrible to

him. An innate duty must be performed without attachment, as

it leads to equanimity.
When a being is born as a human being, he is provided
"
359,"318 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 |
with all the matter, such as body, riches, property etc., and he

has to leave behind all the materials here, when he departs. It
proves that he has been granted this material in the same way, -
as a clerk is provided with the material in the office, so that :
he may work with it. But it does not mean, that it is his. As

a clerk is paid for doing the office work, similarly a striver |
who performs actions for the world, his affinity for the world
is renounced and he realizes his identity (unity) with God. This -
unity with God, is his reward.

This world is the field for practising spiritual discipline. 7
Whatever material has been provided to us here, is only for
practising spiritual practices, rather than for pleasure and
prosperity. It is, neither ours nor for us. If and when, we gain
our own objectives viz., the Supreme Bliss (God-realization), _
(Self-realization) nothing remains to be gained after that i.e.,
there remains no desire for anything else (Gita 6/22). But we
may acquire innumerable worldly things, the desire to acquire |
more, is never satisfied, it rather enhances.

When by error, a person accepts a thing as his own and for -
him he is attached to it. The Discipline of Action is an easy
and good method, to wipe out this error. A Karmayogi, who |
without assuming a thing as his own and for him, uses it in order 7
to render service to others, is easily liberated from the worldly -
bondage, as he performs actions for the world, by renouncing
attachment, a feeling of 'mine’ and desire etc., for the same. Thus
the flow of his actions, is towards the world and he is liberated.

On the other hand, a common person who performs actions with
attachment, with feelings of ‘mine’ and desire etc., the flow of
actions is towards him and so he is tied to these.

‘Asakto hyacarankarma'—It is a man, who establishes a link
with the world, and not the world with him. A striver should
perform actions for the welfare of the world without attachment,
having no desire for their fruit. His present affinity for the things
"
360,"Verse 19] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 319
and persons of the world is renounced, by rendering service to
them, and with things and persons of the: future by having no
desire for these. 7 | 7 -
In a fair, volunteers render service to the public, without -
expecting any reward. So they sleep soundly without even
remembering any person of the public. Similarly, a striver who
serves others without expecting any return not ever honour and
praise etc., does not remember them and is thus easily liberated .
from the worldly bondage. ;
In the Discipline of Action, actions are performed for the
welfare of others, without any attachment. Attachment can be
wiped out, only when actions are performed according to the
scriptural injunctions (Manasa 3/16/1). Attachment can never be
wiped out by performing forbidden actions. -
- ‘Paramapnoti purusah'—As in the thirty-fourth verse of the /
thirteenth chapter the Lord has mentioned attainment to the
Supreme by the term ‘param’ (the supreme) for a Sankhyayogi |
(follower of the Discipline of Knowledge), similarly, it has been
mentioned here by the same term for a Karmayogi, (follower -
of the Discipline of Action). It means that a striver according
to his taste, inclination and faith, attains God-realization, by
anyone of the Disciplines of Action, Knowledge or Devotion  —S
(Gita 5/4-5). God is, He Who pervades everywhere, everytime, -
Who is everyone's and is attainable to everyone, undoubtedly
and automatically. ,
Question:—How can the pride of doership which is an
obstacle to God-realization, be wiped out? |
Answer:—-Common people perform actions for themselves,
thinking that they are the doers. But a Karmayogi thinks that
whatever he has acquired from the world, is not his, but it is
of the world. Therefore, with the body, senses, mind, intellect,
money and material etc., which he has acquired from the world, he
renders service to the world. Thus his pride of doership perishes.
"
361,"320 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 3

| A Karmayogt, does not perform actions, in order to enjoy
their fruits. He regards, the body as a fragment of the world.
Therefore, there is nothing special to be proud of, if the body -
renders service to the world, in the same way, as a hand is not :
proud of rendering a great service to the face, by washing it.

A man performs actions in order to achieve a goal. As

soon as the action is over, he ‘gets engrossed, in that goal. As a -
businessman starts business in order'to earn money, but as soon
as his transaction is over, he starts counting the money without _
even thinking of customers etc., who had come to buy articles
from his shop. A worldly man, having a mundane aim, remains
engrossed in the world but he cannot be identified with the
world, in spite of doing so, because the world is kaleidoscopic
and insentient, while the self is uniform and sentient. But the ~
striver who performs actions having God-realization as his aim
gets identified with God, (whether he realizes this fact or not),
because both of these are uniform and sentient. In this state of
identification, no question can arise regarding the pride of doership.

- Actions have a beginning and an end. So a person who ;
performs an action, also ceases to be a doer, as soon as the action
ends. But being under an illusion, he regards himself as a doer, |
even when he does not perform any action. Thus by considering
himself as a doer constantly, his pride of doership, instead of :
perishing, enhances. An orator, considers himself an orator even
when he does not make a speech. He regards himself superior to
the audience and wants the people to honour and serve him and
to fulfil his necessities. But if he regards himself as an orator
only, during the period of a speech and not afterwards, he will
expect no reward from the audience, and thus his doership will
merge in his aim.

As an eater regards himself as an eater, only when he eats

food, a Karmayogi also regards himself as a doer, only when he
performs actions and not at other times. Suppose a Karmayogi, ; a
"
362,"Verse 19] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 321
delivers discourses and he has won high fame; in spite of that,
if an occasion arises to hear a discourse, he can easily listen to
it, without expecting any honour, respect and status, as now he
_ considers himself a listener, not a speaker, without any superiority

complex. He becomes a hearer or a speaker, according to the
need of the moment. Thus his pride of doership does not remain
constant. A thing which changes actually, does not exist. So
how can a relationship with it remain constant? By thinking so,
a striver comes to realize his egolessness.

An actor in a drama plays the role of Hariscandra, but
while playings that role, he does not regard himself as a real
Hariscandra. Similarly, a Karmayogi, while performing all actions
according to the scriptural injunctions, does not regard himself,
as a doer. He, like an actor, serves the world with the worldly -
things, without regarding these as his or for himself. Thus he
has no pride of doership, in the least.

Similarly, he accepts his affinity for his kith and kin, while
serving them, only in order to serve them. He performs his duty to
the best of his capacity and resources, towards his wife, children -
and other members, even though they.are ugly, hard-hearted and
quarrelsome. Moreover, he thinks that his wife or children are |
not only his, but also of others. For example, his wife is her :
children's mother, her father's daughter, her brother's sister and ;
so on. Thus, they have also a claim on her. Similar, is the case’
with other relatives such as father, sons and brothers etc. So a
striver performs his duty efficiently, like an actor without thinking
of the duty of others. By having the pride of doership, a man |
thinks of the duty of others and by thinking so, he deviates from
a duty, while a Karmayogi does not accept his constant affinity
for his caste, order of life, sect and circumstances etc., and so
he performs his duty efficiently. A thing which is not constantly
in existence, is for that matter, not in existence at all. Thus, the
sense of doership of a Karmayog! automatically perishes.
"
363,"322 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3 |
A man has his identity with God, if he has no sense of doership -

unless he ignores. the reality. As a swing while moving, stops still -

for a fraction of a second, at the rope end, in the same way, there

is always the state of actionlessness (equanimity) after a swinging

action ends and the second one begins. Secondly, if we perceive

in the right perspective, we come to know that as the rope of the

swing when it moves, remains straight, a man also remains in a

state of equanimity, even while working. If he wants to realize ~

this fact, he can do so, as soon as an action is over. In case a

striver is ever careful, in this respect, he can realize equanimity

or his identity with God, where there is no sense of doership.

In order to wipe out the pride of doership, a striver should _
distinguish the real which really exists, from the unreal (illusion)
which seems to exist. The world which is changing always is
illusory while the all-pervading Lord is real and He is automatically
attainable to everyone—from Brahma, the creator, to even an
ant, equally. _

The world which seems to exist, 1s every second getting
destroyed. The senses, mind and intellect etc., with which the
world is seen, reflect nothing but illusion. The all-pervading
Lord Who ever exists, is always attainable to us. Therefore, in ~
the Gita it has been declared, ""The unreal has no existence and
the real never ceases to be"" (2/16).

All the worldly objects and actions are nothing but an illusion.
Actionlessness, exists at the beginning and the end, of every action. ;
And this is a rule, that whatever is at the beginning and the end
also remains in the middle. Therefore, actionlessness automatically
exists, even when an action is going on. That actionless essence
viz., the Sentient or God is the illuminator, of both actions and
actionlessness and He, transcends the two.

It is because of our attachment (affinity) to the illusion (objects,
"
364,"Verse 20] - SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 323 /
actions and persons etc.,) that we cannot realize God. As soon as |
attachment is renounced, ever attainable God is realized. Therefore,
when being free from attachment, we apply this illusion (body
and objects etc.,) in the service of the illusory (world), the flow  —s_
of this illusion (body and objects etc.,) is towards the world and |
God the divine essence that is ever attainable, remains.

perfection. Thou should perform selfless action, also for the good
of the world. 20
Comment:— ;
""Karmanaiva hi samsiddhimasthita janakadayah'—The term |
‘adi’ stands. for, ‘beginning’ as well as, ‘like’. Here the former |
meaning does not apply becausé before Janaka, there had been
great souls like Vivasvan, Vaivasvata Manu and king Iksvaku,
who had attained perfection through the performance of action
(Gita 4/1-2). Therefore, here it is used in the latter sense which
means that some great souls like Janaka, before and after him,
leading householder's life attained salvation by action. |
_ This Discipline of Action is very old. By this discipline,
Janaka and several other great souls have attained salvation or
God-realization. Therefore, if anyone at present or in future, wants
to realize God through the path of action, he without regarding
the body and the objects as his own, should apply these in the
"
365,"324 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3 :
service Of the world by considering these as the world's. In fact,

they belong to the world. By doing so one's affinity with the :
world is easily renounced and God is attained. Therefore, the 7
Discipline of Action is an easy, good and independent means .
to realize God.

Here the expression, 'Karmana eva’ stands for the expression
'Asakto hyacarankarma' i.e., performance of action without
attachment. By performing the actions thus, a man is liberated
from their bondage otherwise he is enslaved (Mahi., Santi. 241/7).

It is the characteristic of the style of the Gita, that the :
Lord briefly repeats the main idea of the preceding verse in the
next one also, which is of great help to a striver. Performance
of action without attachment explained in the preceding verse,
is explained in brief in this verse by the expression 'Karmana _
eva’. Similarly, He will explain the main point, described in the
sixth verse of the twelfth chapter, again in the seventh verse in
brief, in the expression, ""Whose mind is set on Me"". °

Here the Lord instead of the expresssion 'Karmana eva’,
could have used the expression ""Yogena eva’. But here the topic -
is of the performance of action without attachment. Therefore,
the Lord has used this expression, which suits the context. |

In fact, the sentient Lord cannot be realized through insentient :
actions alone. The stumbling block to God-realization is removed -
through the performance of action, without attachment. Then the
all-pervading God is realized.

Generally people think that they can attain God, by performing
action or by making effort. They hold that, as they have to make
a lot of effort in order to meet a high officer, they will have to
make much more effort, (in the form of penance, fasts etc.,) in
order to attain God, Who is the Lord of infinite universes. But
that is an error on their part.
"
366,"Verse 20] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 325

Human life has a great affinity for actions. So in the Gita it
is mentioned, ""Meeting death when passion prevails, the embodied
soul, is born among those attached to action"" (14/15). Therefore, -
a man has an inclination for action and he wants to attain his .
aim through actions. He believes that as the worldly things can
be acquired through actions, so God could also be realised by
action. So he tries to attain Him through action. But the fact is, |
that the Imperishable Lord cannot be attained by actions. Only .
the perishable worldly things, can be acquired through actions,
because all actions are performed with the help of a perishable -
(body, senses and mind etc.,) while God is realized by total
renunciation of affinity for the perishable.

Every action has a beginning and an end, so its fruit is -
also perishable. A thing which is at some distance (unacquired), _
with the point of view of space or time can be acquired by
action. Thus, only the worldly things which are perishable,
changeful and confined, can be acquired through action. But -
the Lord Who pervades everywhere and Who is uniform and
imperishable, cannot be attained through action. He is naturally _
attainable. Worldly things cannot be acquired by thinking alone
but the Lord can be realised by thought, because He is close to
us. The fact is, that the Lord is not attained by thinking alone, :
but when a striver thinks of the Lord, he stops thinking of the ;
world. As soon as thinking about the world is renounced, the
ever attainable Lord is realized. ~ :

Not only the all-pervading God, is never away from us but His
being away from us, is impossible also. He is much nearer, these
even the supposedly close T'ness, which is limited spatially and
temporally, but God knows no limitation. In order to experience
such a close and ever available God, it is deceiving one's self,
to apply logic and arguments as if it were a worldly object.

Worldly things cannot be acquired only by having a keen
desire, while God can be realized, only by having a keen desire.
"
367,"326 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 >
Human life is meant to have a keen desire for God-realization,
not for sense enjoyment. This desire is not aroused, because
man has. a desire for worldly pleasures and prosperity. If desire
for pleasure and prosperity is renounced, a keen desire for .
God-realization may be aroused instantly and God may also be
realized immediately. ,

It is necessary to clearly understand, the difference between
the ‘aim’ and the desire, for fruit. God-realization is the aim :
of human life, while desire to acquire perishable things, is the
desire for fruit of action. An aim is achieved, while desire for
fruit of action is wiped out. Self-realization or God-realization
is the aim, rather than the fruit. Action which is performed in
order to attain an aim, cannot be called an action with ‘desire
for fruit’. Therefore, a Karmayogi performs all actions, with an _
objective rather than with a desire for fruit.

In Karmayoga (Discipline of Action), prescribed actions
are performed with the aim of renouncing affinity for actions
(matter). Such a striver performs actions for the welfare of
others, by renouncing selfish desire for fruit, while a common -
man performs actions for himself, with the desire for fruit. In

_. the case of the latter, the action is turned into fruit and so the

fruit has its affinity for the action; while aim has no affinity for
action. When a striver performs action for the welfare of others, .
without expecting any reward, his misconception that the Lord
is far away from him, is removed.

'Lokasangrahamevapi sampasyankartumarhasi'—The word
‘loka’ includes three aspects—({1) Human world (2) Creatures of
the world (3) All the scriptures (except the Vedas). Performance
of actions (of daily routine) for the human world and its creatures,
according to the ordinance of the scriptures is 'Lokasangraha’'
(maintenance of the world).

‘Lokasangraha’ means to persuade the people to turn to the
real, by dissuading them from the unreal. If a great soul, through
"
368,"Verse 20] _ SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 327 |
his word and action, persuades people to turn towards the real,
from_the unreal, it leads them to salvation. |
If he performs his duty merely as a show, it is not 7
‘lokasangraha’. He should perform his duty sincerely, according
to his caste, order of life and sect etc.
No action is as such either superior or inferior. Whatever |
action is performed, according to one's caste, order of life, sect,
time and circumstances, is regarded as superior. Actions are :
regarded as superior and inferior according to their form and
fruit.* When desire for fruit is renounced, all actions lead to
perfection or God-realization. As far as renunciation of affinity
for the insentient (matter) is concernedj all actions—superior or
inferior, are of equal importance. |
No one can live without the help of others. A body is acquired ~
from the parents; knowledge and education is received from
preceptors. Food stuff, clothes, a house and other necessities of
life, are prepared by others. Thus everyone has to depend on |
others for his necessities. Therefore, every person is indebted to
others. In order to get out of this debt, he has to perform his duty -
for the welfare of others, without any selfish motive. When he
does not regard the body and other worldly objects in the least |
as his own or for him, he is freed from the debt. :
Appendix—Here the expression ‘Karmanaiva hi sarnsiddhi- ;
masthitah’ proves that Karmayoga is an independent discipline for
salvation. The kings such as Janaka etc., also attained perfection by
performing actions because they ruled over their empire in order to
serve others and to comfort them rather than for their selfish end. |
‘lokasangrahamevapi sampaSyankartumarhasi’—this expression
means that you should set an example to the people that by
practising Karmayoga supreme goal is attained.
* Oratory is regarded as superior to sweeping. Less charity seems to bear
less fruit while more charity seems to bear more fruit.

own, because by doing so, his egoism is nourished which is an
obstacle to self-realization. The feelings, ""I am a renouncer,"" -
""I am dispassionate,” ""I am a devotee"" and ""I am a knower""
nourish his egoism and thus these are stumbling blocks to Self- |
realization. There is no personal ego at all in a Self-realized :
person the prime ego remains only for common dealings and is ""
engaged in rendering service to the world, as it belongs to the
world (Gita 7/4; 13/5).

The body, riches, family, position, ability and authority —
etc., which have been provided to us by the world, are neither
meant for our pleasure nor for our possession, but these are
for service of others. He who enjoys these himself, is verily a
thief (Gita 3/12). All of these belong to the world and so great
men utilize these in rendering service to the world. They have
a natural inclination, for the welfare of all beings. |

The feeling of selflessness, causes unity and love, while a So
"
370,"Verse 21] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 329 |
feeling of selfishness, causes strife, the former, leads to salvation
while the latter. to degradation. By regarding the body as T',
""Mine’ and ‘For me’ the feeling of selfishness, is caused. Great . = _
men who do not accept a feeling of affinity for the body, have .
no selfish motive. So all their actions, are for the welfare of
others. The sight, touch, talk and thinking of such ‘great men,
automatically lead to the welfare of people. Even, the air which
touches them does good to the people. .
Such great men are of two kinds—(1) 'Avadhiita’—the
hermit kind, who lead.a holy and lonely life; such hermits are -
ideal only as hermits, not for common folk. (2) 'Acarya'—Model
for others—who are an example to others. Their actions are,
according to the scriptural injunctions. They have neither egoism |
nor a sense of ‘mine’. Their actions are automatically performed, -
for the welfare of the world. They leave their sweet smell by
destroying bad smell, just like a blooming flower. Such great
men have their identity with the Lord, because. both of them
work for the welfare of the entire world.
Different limbs of a body, constitute the body and remain -
ever prepared to help one another. When anyone is injured, and
they consider its recovery as that of the entire body. Similarly,
all the beings of the world, in spite of being different, are one .
and the same, and the performance of duty by one, 1s for the -
welfare of the entire. world.
As far as actions and words of the great men, are concerned,
they leave a gross impression which is restricted, because actions
are limited. But, as far as their feelings are concerned, their
influence is subtle and limitless, as the feelings are limitless. They
set examples for other people, by performing duty, according to
their caste, social order, sect etc., and make a strong impression
on others.
Though a great man does not perform any action for himself,
as he has no pride of doership, yet people feel that he performs
"
371,"330 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
actions. So the term ‘acarati' (Doer) has been used. Actions are
automatically performed by him, for the welfare of others, without

any selfish motive. Though he has nothing to do (Gita 3/17), and _
has no egoism (Gita 2/71), yet duty is naturally and efficiently .
performed by him, which is automatically for the welfare of

the entire world. . : | , :

It is generally observed, that whatever actions are performed
and whatever standards are set, by great men these are followed ”
by common people. a

Common people who attach importance to wealth and
position, follow the examples set by millionaires and leaders,
regarding them as great, though they may not be really so. The _
rich people and leaders, resort to evil practices such as falsehood,
forgery, dishonesty, thefts and corruption, to gain riches, fame
and status in society. The common people who consider them :
great, follow those evil practices. Thus, evils become rampant
in the society, without any schooling or teaching.

How shocking and surprising it is, that at present a millionaire
is regarded as great, but a devotee, who chants the name of the |
Lord a hundred thousand times a day, is not considered great. :
People do not think that when a millionaire dies, he will not take -
a single penny with him, while the whole wealth of chanting of
the Lord's name, will ultimately go with the devotee.

Great and noble men, such as teachers, preachers, priests, .
leaders and rulers etc., who hold positions of honour in society, ;
should perform their duties very carefully, so that they may leave a
good impression upon other people, who may follow the standards
set by noble men. They are just like drivers, who carry the
passengers to their destinations or might cause accidents.

‘Sa yatpramanam kurute lokastadanuvartate'—A great man
is free from such evils as desire, feeling of mine, attachment,
"
372,"Verse 21] | SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 331 |

selfishness and favouritism and he does not attach importance ;

to perishable objects. His word automatically, influences people

and they follow his preaching. |
Here a doubt may arise, why the Lord has used, 'He sets a .

standard’ and also 'Whatever a great man does’ when either one

of these might have been sufficient. The clarification is, that

though the deed is important, yet a great man cannot perform

acts of the people from different castes, orders of life etc. He |

sets a standard by his word, quoting scriptures and historical

_ Characters, so that people of other castes, orders of life and creed -

etc., by performing their duty, sincerely and promptly may attain

perfection (Gita 18/45). By following his advice, they start to

perform their duty according to their castes, creeds and orders

of life etc. -
Though the scope of such deeds is limited while that of

standard set (word) is wide, yet the Lord has used, five terms

""Yat', ‘Yat’, ‘Tat’, 'Tat' and (specially) ‘Eva’, for the deeds of a ”

great man. He has used only two terms 'Yat' and 'Tat' for the

standard set by him. It means that the deeds of a great man :

have five times the effect, while standard set (word) has only

twice the effect. Therefore, the Lord in the twentieth verse of

this chapter, has laid special emphasis, on the performance of |

duty, for the welfare of the world. .
If a great man instead of performing his duty, according

to his caste, creed and stage of life etc.,; preaches the gospel as

a (standard) only, it will not influence people. They will think

that these are merely precepts, which need not be translated

into practice, because the man himself is only preaching, not |

practising. Therefore, a great man has to do good to the people

by performing his duty, as well as by setting standards i.e.,

through word.
Only those people, who have faith in a great man follow

his deeds and the set standard (word). But if a person does not
"
373,"332 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
regard a great man as really great, he will not follow the deeds
and standard (word) set by him.

In modern times people do not have much inclination for -
Spiritualism, in spite of a lot of preaching. The reason is, that .
preachers themselves, do not practise, what they preach. So it
is a shot in the air. But on the other hand, there are preachers |
who believe in the maxim ""Example is better than precept.""
Their shot hits the target and inspires men to practise spiritual
discipline. Spiritual discourses leave some impression on almost
everyone, but those who are devotees and have reverence, are -
immensely benefited.

There is nothing in the three worlds, O Arjuna, that is for me

yet I engage Myself, in action. 22 -
Comment:—

_ ‘Na me parthasti kartavyam trisu lokesu kificana nanavaptam-
avaptavyam'—The Lord is not confined to one world. So He is
saying that there is nothing in the three worlds, that should be ;
done by Him. All men, beasts and birds etc., perform actions,
in order to attain something or the other. But the Lord mentions
here, an uncommon fact, that He also performs action, though
there is nothing which should be done or attained by Him.

Though God has nothing to do for Himself, yet He incarnates
for the welfare of others and performs action for the protection of
"
374,"Verse 22] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 333 |
the good, for the destruction of the wicked and for the establishment
of righteousness (Gita 4/8). The Lord creates the universe, also
for the salvation of creatures. He has created heavens, so that .
beings may reap the fruit of their virtuous actions. Eighty-four .
lac, forms of lives and hells, have been created, so.that beings
may reap the fruit of their evil actions, while human lifé-has been
created so that a human being, having transcended virtues and .
vices, may attain salvation viz., God-realization. This is possible,
only when he does nothing for himself. All his activities—actions,
with the gross body, thinking with the subtle body and trance -
with the causal body, should be applied to the welfare of the
world. The reason is, that this threefold body, is not of one's own,
but it belongs to the world. Therefore, a Karmayogi considers
the body, senses, mind, intellect and all the matter etc., of the
world, (which in fact belong to the world) and he utilizes them -
im rendering service to the world. If he uses these in order to
enjoy pleasures, he commits a blunder. When a person accepts ,
worldly things as his own he wants to reap the fruit and in
order to reap the fruit, he has to perform action. Thus, so long -
as a man perform action in order to attain something, his duty
remains to be performed by him.

If we give a serious thought to the subject, we realise that :
a man has to do nothing for himself, because God Who is to be -
attained is ever-attainable and the self is eternal while actions and
their fruits are perishable. So, how can the perishable (actions
and their fruits) have their affinity for the imperishable (self)?
Actions have their affinity for the body and the world, rather
than the self. Therefore, there is nothing to be done for the self.
When there is nothing to be done for the self, how can there be
anything to do for God?

While talking about an enlightened soul, who has attained
perfection through the Discipline of Action, the Lord (in the
seventeenth and eighteenth verses of this chapter) declared, ""There
"
375,"334 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
_ exists no action to be done, by such an enlightened soul who

is delighted, satisfied and contented, in the self. Such a soul

has nothing to do with the performance or non-performance of __

actions, and he has not the least affinity for selfishness, with any |

being. Yet he performs actions for the welfare of the world.""

Similarly, the Lord declares, for Himself, there is nothing that

should be done by Him, yet He is engaged in action for the

welfare of the world. It means that an enlightened soul becomes

identical with the Lord (Gita 14/2) and as the Lord is a model

in the three worlds (Gita 3/23; 4/11), similarly an enlightened .

soul is a model in this world (Gita 3/25).

“Varta eva ca karmani'——Here, the Lord by the term ‘eva’
(only) means to say, that He performs actions enthusiastically,
promptly, carefully and thoroughly.

As the compartments of a train attached to an engine, follow -
the engine, similarly the Lord and the saints (who have nothing
to do and nothing more to attain), perform their duty and other sy.
people follow them. These latter people have a desire to act and
to attain, something or the other. They get rid of this desire by
performing their duty, without expecting any reward. If the Lord -
and the saints, did not perform their duty, the people would also
follow their path, and they would become indolent and heedless
and would perform forbidden actions. So they would not get rid
of desires. Therefore, duty is automatically performed by the Lord ""
and the saints, for the welfare of the whole humanity.

As the Lord always performs His duty, He never abandons
it, similarly a striver should always perform his duty, so that he
may attain God easily. If an aspirant does not perform his duty, .
he remains deprived of God-realization. ,

Comment:—
[In the twenty-second verse, the Lord by a positive inference,
laid emphasis on the performance of duty. In this verse, He by .
the negative inference, mentions the harm that would be done _
if He did not perform duty.] Bo
'Yadi hyaham na varteyam jatu karmanyatandritah'—The
term 'Hi' has been used here to support the expression ""I engage
Myself in action"", used in the preceding verse. ;
The Lord declares that it is impossible for Him, not to perform
action. But if it is so assumed that He does not perform action—in
this sense the expression ""Yadi jatu' (If ever) has been used.
The term ‘atandritah’ means, that actions should be
performed, very carefully and promptly, renouncing indolence
and heedlessness. By doing so, affinity for actions is renounced.
"
377,"336 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA - [Chapter3
As a stiff twig is easily broken but an elastic one cannot be easily
broken. Similarly, ‘affinity for actions is renounced, if these are
performed, carefully and promptly, but these are not renounced |
if performed, indolently and heedlessly. Therefore, the Lord (in ;
the nineteenth verse) has used the term 'Samacara' (Perform well)
and here the term ‘atandritah' (unwearied), has been used.
If there is recollection of an action, time and again, it means,
that there has been some fault (desire, attachment, incompletion, :
indolence, heedlessness, indifference etc.,) in the performance of
that action and so affinity for it, has not been renounced. :
""Mama vartmanuvartante manusy4h partha sarvasah'—By this
expression; the Lord seems to declare that those who follow His —
path really deserve to be called human beings, while those who
while away time because of indolence and heedlessness, and _
demand their rights, do not deserve to be called human beings
even though in human-garb.
In the twenty-first verse of this chapter, the Lord declared, .
""Whatever a great man does, the same is done by others as well;
and whatever standard he sets, is followed by others,"" while here, . -
He declares, ""Men in everyway follow My path"". It means that
a great man is a model for the human world only, while the
Lord is a model for the three worlds. | ,
' The Lord incarnates in the world, to set an example to. -
other people. He who does not live for himself, and knows
the art of living, in the world. The world is an educational
institution, where we have to learn how to do good to others,
by renouncing desire, attachment and selfishness etc. Through
this lesson, we have to attain salvation. The only aim of human ©
life, is to perform our duty by serving others and doing good
to them, including members of the own family and try to lead
one another, to salvation.
_  ""Utsideyurime loka na kuryam karma cedaham'—The Lord (in
the twenty-third verse) explained the harm if He performed action
"
378,"Verse 23-24] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 337 ;
unweariedly and now (in the twenty-fourth verse) He explains
the harm that could be done if he did not perform action.

‘Though, it is not possible for the Lord not to perform action, |
yet if it is so assumed’—in this sense the Lord has used the :
term ‘Cet’ (If)—this expression means, that a man should not be
attached to inaction (Gita 2/47). Therefore, the Lord by citing His
own example says, that He performs action even though there is
nothing unattained, which remains to be attained by Him. And |
if He did not perform action (according to the caste and order
of life in which He has incarnated), He would be the creator of
confusion of castes and cause destruction of the people. It is so,
because by renouncing their duty, men will also got steeped in
the mode of ignorance (Gita 14/18).

The Lord is a model for the three worlds and all beings ~
follow Him. Therefore, if the Lord does not perform His duty,
no one in the three worlds, will perform his duty and thus they
will suffer a downfall. :

‘Sankarasya ca karta syamupahanyamimah prajah'—If the
Lord did not perform action (duty), these worlds would perish 7
and He would be the root cause of their destruction, but this is _
not at all possible.

The term 'sankara’ stands for the mixture of two castes. |
Arjuna (in the fortieth and the forty-first verses of the first :
chapter) said, ""If I fight the family will be ruined. With the
ruin of the family, the immemorial religious rites of the family
will be destroyed. With the destruction of the religious rites,
impiety will overcome the whole family. By the prevalence of
impiety, the women of the family will become immoral. With
the corruption of women, mixing of castes (intermingling of
castes) will result."" Thus, Arjuna meant to say, that war would
lead to the mixing of castes.* But the Lord contradicts Arjuna's

* Even according to the argument of Arjuna, non-performance of duty
(action) is the cause of confusion of castes. Confusion of castes arises only when
"
379,"338 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA _ [Chapter3

statement, by citing His own example when He declares that :

confusion of castes, would arise by the non-performance of duty.

Therefore, here Lord Krsna seems to urge Arjuna to wage the

war, otherwise he would be the creator of mixed castes. | :
| An Important Fact. a

The Lord, answers Arjuna's question, ""Why do You urge ,
me to engage in this terrible action?"" In the twenty-second, the
twenty-third and the twenty-fourth verses, by citing His own
example that He engages Himself in action even though He has -
nothing to do personally with it and nothing to attain in the three
worlds. Therefore, He urges him to be engaged in action.

The Lord gives Arjuna a hint, that He had agreed to be |
his chariot-driver and he as His chariot-warrior is performing -
His duty very carefully and efficiently, so that other people
may follow His example as He stands as a model for them. So
he should also perform his duty as a Ksatriya (member of the “
warrior class) carefully and efficiently.

women are corrupted and they become so by non-performance of their duty. If
women believe that they should perform their duty by remaining chaste, in the
same way as their husbands performed their duty by sacrificing their lives, they
cannot neglect their duty. Thus by performing their duty, they will maintain their
chastity and there will be no mixing of castes.

Comment:— :
'‘Saktah karmanyavidvamso yatha kurvanti bharata'—The

expression 'saktah avidvarhsah' has been used, for those ignorant

men attached to worldly pleasures, who have full faith in the

scriptures, the ordinance of the scriptures and also the actions -

sanctioned by the scriptures, and who are neither enlightened

nor vile but are attached to actions, pleasures and objects. They

are called ignorant (unwise) because of their desire, though they :

have bookish knowledge of the scriptures. They are well-read

but are not enlightened. They are called ignorant, because they -

perform actions for themselves.

Such ignorant people, perform their duty scrupulously |
according to the ordinance of the scriptures without heedlessness -
and indolence believing that it will not bear fruit, if duty is not
performed scrupulously according to strict scriptural ordinance.

The Lord urges wise people, to act in the same way, without

attachment for the welfare of the world. _ |

'Kuryadvidvarnstathasaktascikirsurlokasangraham'— ‘asaktah’ .
and 'Vidvan'—unattached wise men, are enlightened souls* who

are totally free from desire, a feeling, of ‘mine’, lust, favouritism,

* The supreme state (of God-realization) which is obtained by men of
renunciation is also attained by men of action (Gita 5/4-5), yet in that state also
there is a little difference in their marks and natures according to the path each

381,"340 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3_~
selfishness etc., and who have not the least attachment, to body
and other objects etc.

The expression 'Lokasangraham cikirsuh’ (wishing the welfare |
of the world) has been used for the expression 'Lokasangrahamh
evapi sathpasyan' (with a view to the welfare of the masses)
used in the twentieth verse of this chapter and explained, in the
twenty-first verse. | SO

All actions of wise men, are naturally performed for the
welfare of the world. They have also no egoistic notion, that
they are engaged in the welfare of others. As a licentious person, ~
is attached to sensual pleasures, the greedy to riches and an
infatuated one to the family, the wise are engrossed, in the welfare
of all beings, naturally and without any egoistic feeling. Because
of the total renunciation of affinity, for the materialistic world, -
their so-called bodies, senses, minds and intellects etc., are |
inclusive of the term ‘loka’ (world) used in the expression,
'lokasangraha' (welfare of the world). | .

People think that such wise men have a desire to be engrossed
in the welfare of the world, but in fact they have no desire at all. _
They regard the body, senses, mind, intellect, objects, position,
riches, ability and all other resources, as of the world and for
the world, which these really are. So all of them, automatically —__-
remain engaged in rendering service to the world, without any .
expectation of reward. | |

The terms, ‘yatha' (as) and ‘tatha' (so), have been used, to
point out that as ignorant men scrupulously act for their selfish
motive, so the wise should act, without attachment, aiming at the
welfare of the world. When the wise perform actions thus for __
the welfare and salvation of all beings, good and sweet feelings,
automatically propagate.
followed. The men of renunciation remain indifferent to actions while men of
action perform actions very promptly. This difference is not hard and fast. It is
found in some realized souls.
"
382,"Verse 25-26] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 341 ”
An ignorant person performs action scrupulously, in order :
to reap its fruit, while a wise man is neither attached to the fruit
of action, nor has any duty to perform. So, it is possible for him
to be indifferent to action. Therefore, the Lord directs him to
act, without attachment. 7 -
In the twenty-first verse, a great (wise) man was called a
model, but here he has been called a follower. It means that
a wise man may either be a leader (model) or a follower, as
automatically good to the world is done by him. For example,
Lord Rama preaches a gospel to His subjects and also goes into -
exile by obeying His father. In both cases, welfare of the world
is done by Him because He has nothing to do either with the
performance or non-performance of such actions.
A wise man who performs actions without attachment, having _
no desire for its fruit, automatically leaves an impression on
the ignorant people, who are attached to action, whether it is
clearly noted or not. Not only people, but beasts and birds are -
also influenced by such feelings and actions.
So long as, a man does not perform prescribed actions
without desire for fruit, his cycle of birth and death continues. .
As long as, he works for himself, he has to act, because the self .
is eternal, but an action and its fruit are perishable. Therefore, it
is everyone's obligatory duty, to work for the welfare of others,
without any selfish motive.
The Discipline of Action (performance of action without
desire for fruit) seems difficult, because we attach importance .
to the worldly objects. If we resolve, that we have to perform
all actions for the welfare of others without any desire, the path
of action will become easy, and quick.
In fact, there is no importance as such of the object, rather
it is of its use. That use is significant, only when one does not
"
383,"342 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA | _ (Chapter3
attach much value to the object. No worldly object is personal, _
it belongs to the world. But it has been given to us, so that we
may make a proper use of it. When we regard it as our own, it
-becomes difficult for us to use it for the welfare of others. In |
fact, it is neither an object nor an action which leads to bondage
but it is attachment to it which binds. |
_The wise, perform actions for the welfare of the world
_ without any egoistic notion, because they hold that whatsoever _
possessions such as body, senses, mind, intellect, position etc.,
have been acquired from the world, and these belong to the ~-
world. So it is honest on our part, to use the worldly-materials,
in the service of humanity; there is nothing creditable in returning
trust money to its owner. In doing so, we are simply relieved
of our responsibility—a debt has been repaid. In like manner,
by using our possessions in the service of the world, we merely __
repay the debt we owe to the world, since it is only from the
_ world, that we have received these possessions.

""Na buddhibhedam janayedajianam karmasanginam
josayetsarvakarmani vidvanyuktah samacaran'—A wise man |
without attachment, who has been described in the twenty-fifth
verse by the expression 'Asaktah vidvan,' has been called ""Yuktah
vidvan' here. : |

An enlightened soul, who remains, equanimous, is unmoved
under all circumstances, whose senses are controlled and to whom
a clod, a stone and a piece of gold, are same, is called 'Yuktah
Vidvan' (wise man established in the self) (Gita 6/8).

Ignorant men attached to prescribed action, who have been
described in the twenty-fifth verse by the expression ‘Saktah —
Avidvarsah' have been called by the expression 'Karmasanginam
Ajnanam' here. These people have been called 'KarmasangTt
(attached to action) and ‘ajfiant (Ignorant), because they perform
action prescribed by the scriptures, for themselves, (in order to
gain pleasure, honour and praise etc.)
"
384,"Verse 25-26] | + SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 343 -
Great men have greater responsibility, because common men
follow them. Therefore, the Lord urges the wise man, that he
should not perform any such action or make any such utterance,
as may lead the ignorant to a downfall, which has been called |
here ‘as buddhibhedam’ (unsettlement in the minds). Therefore, a -
wise man should perform virtuous actions, according to his caste
and order of life for the welfare of other people, so that they |
may be inspired to perform their duty, without any desire for |
fruit. This rule also applies to important persons of society and
a family that they should perform their duties scrupulously, and -
they may set an example for other members of society and family.
Some of the examples, of unsettling the minds of ignorant
people, are as follows:—
1. Knowledge is superior to action. Actions bind a man. -
This type of preaching undermines faith im action. |
2. Everybody performs actions with a selfish motive. Desire
for fruit is natural, Why should a man perform action, if he -
has, no desire for its fruit? Such thoughts unsettle the minds of
ignorant people. :
3. When a person performs actions, with the desire for their
fruits, he has to take birth again and again, to reap the fruit of
his actions. Thus common people cease to have faith in the fruit |
of action. Such statements unsettles the minds of ignorant people. -
Consequently, they renounce the performance of virtuous actions,
even though they remain attached to their fruit.
The fact is, that it is not action, but attachment, which leads
to bondage. Thus an enlightened soul instead of confusing the
minds of ignorant people, should perform his obligatory duty,
according to his caste and order of life and also get it performed
by others, so that they, instead of having a downfall, may rise
to a higher level. He should admire their virtuous actions, and
make them aware of the evil actions, so that they may renounce
these. Moreover, he should explain to them, that it is not proper |

385,"344 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
to have a desire for the fruit of virtuous actions, such as: sacrifice,
charity and adoration etc., because this fruit is nominal. It is just
like selling a precious jewel for the price of pebbles and so it
is not a wise act. But if they act without desire for fruit, it will _
lead them to bliss. | :
Similarly, he should not. confuse the minds of ignorant people,
_ about adoration and spiritual practice. Generally, people say that
it is futile to chant the Lord’s name, without concentration. But
an enlightened soul should preach, that chanting of the Lord's ©
name never goes in vain. But if the name is chanted with ~
concentration, it expedites spiritual progress. Everyone possesses
some virtue or the other. Therefore, when an enlightened soul
wants to preach a sermon to a common man, he instead of
reproaching and insulting him, should praise his virtues and _
' then should preach the sermon. Such a sermon makes a strong
impression, upon the common man. The chief of a family or the
society should also do the same. . ) :
_ The Lord through the terms 'samacaran' (duly performing)
and ‘josayet' (should get them to perform) directs a wise man -
(i) to perform his duty, scrupulously according to the scriptural
injunctions, (ii) he should make the ignorant men, who are
attached to action, perform their duty. |
. Qstentation in the performance of actions is hypocrisy,  -
which is a mark of demoniac nature (Gita 16/4). Therefore, the
Lord orders people to perform actions, not for show, but for
the welfare of the people. An enlightened soul should set other
people, who are attached to action, to act by performing their
duty scrupulously, without attachment and also by preaching _
a sermon. He should inspire them to discard selfishness, and
also inspire them through his example and precepts, to perform
prescribed actions and to refrain from forbidden actions.
Appendix—Enlightened exalted souls and God—both are
free from egoistic notion. Therefore they perform their duty
"
386,"Verse 27] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 345 :
for the welfare of others, not for themselves. A striver should
do nothing for himself because in the self there is no sense
of doership. The act of deviating the people from the sinful
(wrong) path and directing them towards the virtuous (right)
path is welfare of others. The method of the welfare of others :
is—to act according to the ordinance of the scriptures; but a
striver from within should have the feeling that he has to do
nothing for himself. But he should not divulge the fact among :
people that he dees nothing for himself. | |

All actions are performed, in all cases, by the modes of -

""I am the doer."" 27
Comment:—
'Prakrteh kriyamanani gunaih karmani sarvasah'—All the :
functions of the world, such as birth and growth of bodies and
plants, flow of the Ganges and changes in worldly things etc.,
as well actions, such as seeing, hearing, eating and drinking etc.,
are carried out by the modes of nature. But, a man deluded by |
egoism divides all activities performed by cosmic energy, into
two parts—To the first part, belong actions, which he thinks he
does not perform but occur naturally—such as formation of the
body and digestion of food etc. The second part, consists of those
actions which he thinks he performs, such as seeing, speaking
and eating etc. A man out of delusion regards himself as the |
"
387,"346 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
doer of the latter class of actions. Intellect, ego, mind, five subtle
elements, ten organs of perception and actions, and five objects
of senses—these are also called the modes of nature, because _
they are the evolutes of the three modes. of nature, (goodness,
passion and ignorance). The Lord declares that all actions are
performed by the modes of nature, not by the self. _

'‘Ahankaravimiidhatma'—Egoism' is a state of mind, while he
(the self) is the knower of that state. But by an error, he identifies
the self with that state, and. thus he is deluded by egoism.

As a body denoted by the term ‘Idam’, is different from the
self, so is egoism. ‘Idam' cannot be 'I'—this is the rule. But, when
he regards egoism as self, he is known as ‘ahankaravimudhatma’
(one whose mind is deluded by egoism). This assumed egoism
is not wiped out by efforts, as these involve the ego. But, itis _
wiped out by non-acceptance viz., non-assumption.

Egoism is of two kinds:— :

(i) Real* as 'T am’ (relating to one's existence). -

(ii) Unreal (assumed)—as 'I am body’. |

‘Real egoism' is natural and eternal, while unreal egoism',
is unnatural and perishable. Real egoism, can be forgotten but
cannot perish, while unreal egoism may appear, but cannot exist. _
A man commits an error, that he forgets real egoism (self) and
assumes the unreal egoism (I am the body) to be true.

'Kartahamiti manyate'—Though all actions are performed by
modes of nature, yet a person whose mind is deluded by egoism, _-

* Real egoism in fact is not egoism. It 1s an aggregate of Truth, Knowledge
and Bliss. It-is called, ‘real’, because it never changes, while the unreal egoism,
changes. Today a man is uneducated. Having received schooling he says he is
educated. Thus the unreal egoism changes. But he (the self) remains the same.
As soon as he ceases to identify himself with the unreal egoism, the real egoism,
as the aggregate of Truth, Consciousness and Bliss, remains. :
"
388,"Verse 27] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 347 -
thinks that he is the doer, because he regards egoism, as the self.
It is because of this egoism that he identifies the self with the
body, senses, mind and thus regards the self as the doer. This
egoism is self-made and so it can be eliminated by the self. The
method, to throw it out is, through non-assumption. This false :
assumption, can be rooted out, if he realizes that he (the self)
is different from the body, senses and mind etc.
Performance of actions and non-performance of actions—all
are activities. Sleeping, waking, sitting, walking and trance etc.,
are included in activities, which take place in nature, while the 7
self is free from performance and non-performance of actions. The
self is the illuminator and knower of them. A man automatically
remains established in the self, but the self assumes its affinity
for actions. This assumed affinity, is called 'egoism’. -
AS a wave is a part of an ocean, so the ocean and the wave a
belong to the same class. Similarly a body, a fragment of the
world and the world, belong to the same class. The soul (self) :
is different from the world or the body. Man does not take the
world, to be his own Self 'T’ but he does take, even though |
wrongly, his body to be so. a
Just as a wave without an ocean, has no independent
existence of its own, similarly, without the world, there cannot
be any separate existence of the body. But, when a man, whose
mind is deluded by egoism, identifies the self with the body,
several desires are born in him, as he has desire for family,
riches, praise and pleasures etc. He does not realize, that by
identifying the self with the body, he is already a captive and
these desires will strengthen the bondage and will hurl him into
the abyss of adversity.
Even though a striver during his disciplining period, may
not feel that he is above and beyond the modes of prakrti but
"
389,"348 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3  -
when he accepts to be so with a strong faith, he starts feeling _
himself beyond prakrti. Thus, just as a person, is bound due to
his“ wrong assumptions, in the same way he is freed from his
_ shackles through correct assumptions, because it is a principle
that an assumed fact, ceases to be by unassuming it. The same ~
fact, has been pointed out by the Lord, in the eighth verse of
the fifth chapter by the term 'manyeta' (should believe) when He
declares, ""The man, who is united with the Divine and knows
the truth, thinks that he does nothing at all"". By such thinking,
a striver realizes the truth. -
When even the unreal assumptions such as 'I am the body’,
'I am doer’, become so steady, that it seems difficult to renounce
_ these; why would the reality, 'I am not the body' and 'I am not
a doer’, not become steady? And once the reality is confirmed,
how can it be abandoned? -
Appendix—aAll actions take place in the material realm. In the
sentient realm there is no action at all. He whose mind is beguiled
by egoism thinks “I am the doer.” “The mind being beguiled by _
egoism’ means to assume the self’s identity with ego, a fragment
of Apara (lower or insentient) Prakrti (nature) viz., to assume -
ego as the self (1 am this). This is known identification.
He who regards himself as the doer is sentient but he regards
the insentient ‘ego’ as the ‘self’. It means that he whoregardsego_- -
as the self, who assumes himself unipresent, is in facta fragment  -
of God. In that self no sense of doership is possible (Gita 13/29).
In fact the self can’t be identified with the body—“‘Sarirastho’ pi
kaunteya na karoti na lipyate’ (Gita 13/31) but he assumes his
identification with the body ‘kartahamitimanyate’. In fact there _
is no identification, it is merely an assumption. It means that
the self does not become a doer but there is only assumption of
doership due to lack of discrimination—‘manyate’. As soon:as
he thinks himself to be the doer, scriptural sanction-prohibition
applies to him and he has to become the enjoyer (experiencer)
of the fruit of action.
"
390,"Verse 27] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 349 -
In the self there 1s no action. An action takes place where |
there is some empty space. How can an action take place in the
solid self? But when a person assumes himself to be a doer, the
action Of Prakrti, with which he accepts his relationship, bears
fruit for him, which he has to endure. The reason is that he, ~
who is a doer, is an experiencer.
The self has no relationship at all with any ‘Karaka’
(case). Therefore in the self there is not even an iota of doership.
The realm of doership is different. By now the actions which
have been performed in the species of gods, men, animals, birds, -
gnomes and devils etc., out of them no action could have an |
access to the self, nor the body could have an access to the
self, because the division of action and object (body) 1s quite
different, from the division of the self. But without attaching
importance to this discrimination, a man gets bound by action ~
and its fruit. |
He who feels that something is to be done, has affinity with _
ego because without the sense of doership no action is possible.
The sense of doership crops up as one thinks of doing something.
With the sense of doership, there is performance of action and -
by performing an action, the sense of doership is strengthened.
Therefore by practising the spiritual discipline being an agent
a striver can’t be free from egoism. An action done with the
sense of egoism, can never lead to salvation, because egoism is
the root of all misfortunes, of birth and death. If actions are not
performed for one’s own self, affinity for egoism does not persist
viz., affinity for the entire nature (Prakrti) is renounced. Therefore
a striver instead of attaching importance to the performance of
action, should attach importance to discrimination. By attaching
importance to discrimination, discrimination is naturally revealed
clearly and it guides a seeker. Afterwards this discrimination is
transformed into Real-Knowledge. :

tattvavittu mahabaho gunakarmavibhagayoh

puna gunesu vartanta iti matva na_ sajjate ~

Having true knowledge of the respective spheres of modes
(guna) and actions, the knowing soul does not get attached with
them, by realising that, it is an interplay of the modes. 28
Comment:— 7

'Tattvavittu mahabaho gunakarmavibhagayoh'—Here the -
term 'Tu' (but) has been used to distinguish the enlightened soul,
from the person whose mind is deluded by egoism, as described
in the preceding verse. ,

The three modes of goodness, of passion and of ignorance,
are born of nature. The entire universe, including the body, senses, 7
mind, intellect, creatures and objects etc., is constituted of the
three modes. This is the sphere of the modes of nature. Actions -
performed with body etc., is a sphere of action.

The modes (objects) and actions, are ever-changing and .
transitory. The matter, has its origin and end; actions have a
beginning and end. To know this fact properly is, having a true
knowledge of modes and actions, along with their divisions. This |
is the truth, about the modes of nature and their actions. The
soul, (self) never undergoes any action. It is ever unconnected
and changeless i. e., it has no connection with things and actions.

This is the truth about the soul.

The ignorant, when he assumes his relation, with the two
spheres of modes and actions, gets himself bound. Philosophically, .
the main reason of this bondage is ignorance, but from the stand-
point of a striver, the main cause is, ‘attachment.’ Attachment
is, a lack of discrimination. It perishes when discrimination is
aroused. This discrimination is particularly, found in human beings.

What is needed is, simply to give it due importance and to |
"
392,"Verse 28] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI - 351 -
arouse it. Therefore, a striver should wipe out attachment.

The striver, who does not assume his affinity for modes,
(things) and actions, knows the reality of the modes of nature,
and their actions. He may know the reality, either of the modes .
of nature and their action or the self, the result is the same i.e.,
he knows the reality of the two.

(LHtowt Know This Tru

1. Though the Supreme self dwells in the body, yet it neither
acts nor is tainted (Gita 13/31). Evolutes of nature (body, senses, -
mind, intellect etc.,) are called ‘this’. ""This' cannot be 'T’.When
‘this’ (body etc.,) is not ‘I’, how can actions performed by. this
(body etc.,) be 'mine""? It means, that the body, senses, mind and
intellect etc., are the evolutes of Nature, while the self is totally _
unconnected with them. So how can 'the self be the doer of
actions? He who realizes this fact, is not in bondage. When he
realizes, that he does nothing at all, (Gita 5/8), it means, that he -

_ realizes that he (the self) is different from actions.

2. All the movements, such as seeing, hearing, eating and -
drinking etc., are actions, while food stuff and liquids etc., are
objects. These actions and objects, are known by the sense-
organs (eye, ear, tongue etc.). The sense-organs, are known by
the mind, the mind is known by the intellect, and the intellect
is known by egoism (I'ness). This egoism, is also illumined
by the sentient light, which is the knower, the illuminator and
base, of all of them.

How to know the self (sentient) which is beyond egoism? |

In sound sleep, though intellect merges into ignorance, yet
having awaken from sleep, a man says that he slept soundly. It
means, that he existed even, during a sound sleep. Otherwise,
he would not have known (experienced), that he slept soundly.

Thus, everyone in every state, realizes 'I am’. These are called
enlightened souls who, have renounced their affinity even for
"
393,"352 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
‘I’ (egoism) and have realized the self. Lo .

We have a real affinity for changeless God, while our
affinity for the changing nature, is merely assumed. If we
renounce our affinity for Nature, through discrimination, it is -
known as ‘Jiianayoga' (Discipline of Knowledge). If this affinity
is renounced by performing duty, for the welfare of others, it is
known as 'Karmayoga' (Discipline of Action). When we renounce
our affinity for nature, we realize Yoga, (i.e.,) union with God.
Otherwise, it is merely Jnana (knowledge) and karma (action). -
Those who realize this real affinity for God, having renounced |
the affinity for nature, are, ‘tattvavit' (enlightened souls).

‘Gund gunesu vartanta'—The body, senses, mind and intellect
etc., are also called modes, as these are born of modes of nature,
and all actions are performed by them. Out of ignorance, a man -
by assuming his affinity for these modes, becomes a doer of
actions 1.e., by regarding the actions and objects, as his own and
he becomes a doer. But, when he realizes that the self is different :
and is an illuminator, he cannot think, that he is a doer.

A train, having received power from the engine, runs with the -
help of a driver. The engine supplies power but the train reaches
its destination only when the driver drives it. The engine has no
senses, mind and intellect. Therefore, it needs a driver (man) with |
senses, mind and intellect. But, a man has an engine in the form |
of body and has also senses, mind and intellect to drive it. But
the senses, mind and intellect function having received inspiration
from the source of light. First, light is reflected in the intellect,
from the intellect it goes to the mind, from the mind it goes to
the senses, and then the engine (body) functions. Intellect, mind,
senses and the body—these are modes and their illuminator, is
the self which is not connected with them. Therefore, the modes
are acting on the modes. |

Mostly, the people follow examples set by great men.
Therefore, the Lord declares that as a great man, holds that it
"
394,"Verse 28] SADHAKA-SANJIVANL 353 -
is the modes which are acting on the modes, and does not get |
attached to them, while he works for the welfare of the world;
similarly a striver should also do the same.

There is always an attraction between senses and objects, if
these belong to the same class. Ears have attraction for words,
skin for touch, eyes for form, tongue for taste and nose for
smell. Thus, all the five senses have attraction, for their sense-
objects. Any sense cannot have an attraction, for the object of -
another sense. For example, the eye cannot have attraction, for
melodious words. The self in fact, has no attraction for nature, as
it is not of the same character. It is changeless, eternal, pure and
uniform, while nature is, quite otherwise. But by identifying Itself
with a body, a fragment of nature, it has attraction for nature. -
The attraction of the embodied soul, for the worldly objects, is
really attraction of nature in nature. The senses of doership and ;
enjoyership, are in nature, not in the pure self.

Lord Krsna (in the thirty-first verse of the thirteenth chapter)
declared of the self, ""Though It dwells in the body, yet It neither -
acts not is tainted."" The soul, is said to be the cause, in regard to
the experience of pleasure and pain"" (Gita 13/20), when it (the
soul) resides in nature (Gita 13/21) Le., it identifies Itself, with

' body etc. It means that it is because of Its identification with
nature (body and senses etc.,) that It becomes happy or sad.

Because, prakrti, inert as it is, is incapable of experiencing .
pleasure and pain, and the ‘Self (conscious), alone cannot become
enjoyer, without association with Prakrti. ""

The self is free from the kaleidoscopic, qualities of prakrtt,
but it is certainly capable of assuming a relation with prakrti. It
is not, at all inert like a stone, on the contrary it is Knowledge
incarnate. Had the soul not been competent to assume affinity,
how could it establish relation with prakrti? how could it assume
"
395,"354 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3 ”
the activities of prakrti taking place in it (the soul); how could it
assume doership or enjoyership in it? Assuming or not assuming
relation, 1s a feeling and not an action.

The self, possesses competence to establish a relation _
or otherwise; but on its own it is incompetent to act. Only :
Kaleidoscopic agents can have the capability of taking action.

The Self is by nature, changeless whereas prakrti, changes every
moment. In other words, activeness is innate in prakrti. Therefore, :
by establishing affinity, with prakrti, the ‘Self’ supposes itself to
be the doer (Gita 3/27). ~

It is a merit, rather than a demerit, of the soul that It undergoes
no change. It ever remains the same and is uniform. It cannot
change, in the same way, as ice cannot be hot. But it is free and
so it depends upon it, whether it accepts its affinity for nature -
or not, though really it has no affinity with nature.

When the soul identifies itself with the body, it has attraction -
for nature and then It performs actions and has to reap the fruit
in the form of pleasure and pain. In fact, pleasure and pain have
no separate existence. Therefore, the Lord urges men to renounce ~
their assumed affinity for nature, by considering that it is the
modes, which are acting on the modes, while the (soul or self)
is, quite detached from them.

As a matter of fact, disassociation is already. there and
association is wrongly assumed. Therefore, it is necessary to
give up this assumed relation and to realise the fact, that it is
only modes that are reacting on modes.

‘Iti matva na sajjate'— Here, the term 'matva' has been used /
for ‘knowing’. An enlightened soul, distinguishes the soul from
nature, and so he is not attached to the modes of nature.

By using the term 'matva’, the Lord seems to direct striver,
not to be attached to the modes of nature, by regarding these,
as different from the self. :
"
396,"Verse 28] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 355 -

The methods followed by a Karmayogi, (man of Action)
and a Jnanayogi (man of knowledge) are different. The former,
tries to wipe out his assumed identity with the body etc. In the -
Bhagavata, it is mentioned, ""Persons with desires, deserve to
follow the path of action"" (11/20/7). Lord Krsna in the Gita,
has also laid emphasis on the performance of duty, when He
declares, ""Not by non-performance of action does a man attain
actionlessness"" (Gita 3/4). ""For a sage, who wishes to attain to _
Yoga, action is said to be the means"" (Gita 6/3). A Karmayogi, |
performs action for others, not for himself; therefore, he does :
not become an enjoyer. When he does not become an enjoyer,
his sense of doership, automatically perishes. He becomes doer,
only in order to reap the fruit of action. He does not remain a -
doer, if he does not desire the fruit of action. Therefore, in fact
a Karmayogi also does not become, a doer. | ;

In Sankhyayoga (Discipline of Knowledge) there is
predominance of discrimination. Such a striver holds, ‘It is the -
modes which are acting on the modes’. By thinking so he does
not become a doer of actions. The same fact, has been pointed
out by the Lord (in the twenty-ninth verse of the thirteenth ;
chapter) when He declares, ""He who sees, that all actions are ;
performed by nature alone, and that the self is not the doer, he |
verily sees."" When he does not remain a doer, there does not .
arise any question of his being, an enjoyer.

In this chapter, the Lord has laid great emphasis on the

performance of action; as ""It was by action alone that Janaka |
and others attained perfection"" (3/20); ""I engage Myself in action""
(3/22); ""A wise man also performs actions, for the welfare of
the world without attachment, as an ignorant man acts from
attachment” (3/25-26). It proves that performance of actions, is
good in everyway.
"
397,"356 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3 ”

Appendix—He, who is not deluded by egoism, is an enlightened 7
soul. This enlightened soul has been mentioned ‘tattvadarsi’ (the
seer of truth) in the sixteenth verse of the second chapter. An
enlightened soul transcends the spheres of mode (guna) (objects)
and actions totally. -

So long as a striver has affinity for the world, he can’t be an
enlightened soul. The reason is that a man can’t know the world ,
so long as he is attached to it. The world can be known only .
when he disconnects himself from the world—this is the mule.
Similarly a man cannot know God by assuming himself apart -
from God. He can know Him only by identifying himself with
Him—this is the rule. The reason is that really we are different
from the world and are identical with God. The body is identical
with the world while we (self) are identical with God.

Those who are deluded by the modes of nature, remain attached |
to those modes and actions. Man of perfect knowledge, should not :
unsettle the minds of the ignorant, who know only little. 29
Comment:—

'‘Prakrtergunasammidhah  sajjante gunakarmasu'—The
three modes (goodness, passion and ignorance) of nature, bind ;
a man. The mode of goodness (sattva), binds by attachment
to happiness and knowledge; the mode of passion (rajasa) by
attachment to action, and the mode of ignorance (tamasa) by
heedlessness, indolence and sleep (Gita 14/6—8). In this verse,
is a description of those ignorant people, who are deluded by
the modes of nature i.e., who are bound by them, but who have
"
398,"Verse 29] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 357 -
faith in the scriptures, in prescribed virtuous actions and in the
fruit of those actions. These people have been called ‘the ignorant
people attached to action’ (in the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth
verses). They are attached to actions and objects, in order to
enjoy worldly and heavenly pleasures. Therefore they cannot -
understand the advice as to how to rise, above them. So the
Lord has called them ignorant. |
""Tanakrtsnavido mandan'—Ignorant people, perform virtuous |
actions with the expectation of perishable fruits. They remain
attached to the acquired materials, such as wealth etc., and have -
a desire to acquire the unacquired ones also. It is because of
their attachment and desire, that they do not know reality about
modes (objects) and actions.
Ignorant people know what prescribed actions are, and -
how these should be performed well, but they do not know the
reality, about modes and actions. So, it has been said that they
know only little i.e., they are men of imperfect knowledge and -
they have been called ignorant, because they are interested in
enjoying worldly pleasures and prosperity. -
""Krtsnavinna vicdlayet'—A man of perfect knowledge, who
knows the reality about the sphere of the modes and actions
should not confuse the minds of the ignorant ones, otherwise ;
they would renounce virtuous actions and would have a downfall.
Such a wise man, has been called ‘unattached wise man’ (in the
twenty-fifth verse) and ‘balanced (established in the self) wise
man’ (in the twenty-sixth verse of this chapter).
The Lord (in the twenty-fifth verse) directed a wise man to
act by using the term 'Kuryat' while in the twenty-sixth verse |
He ordered him to engage the ignorant men in action, by the
term ‘Josayet’. But the Lord, by the expression, ‘Na vicalayet',
instead of ordering him, makes a bit of relaxation, by declaring,
that he should not at least unsettle the minds of the ignorant,
with his hints or words or actions. The reason is, that the Lord
"
399,"358 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3 -
does not enforce strict discipline on the liberated souls nor do

the scriptures. Actions are automatically performed, by their,
so-called, bodies for the welfare of the world.*

An enlightened soul, whether he is a Karmayogi or a -
Jiianayogi, has not the least attachment, either to actions or
objects, because he knows the truth that there is no real affinity
between him and actions or objects.

The ignorant, perform virtuous actions in order to gain the
heaven. Therefore, the Lord has ordered the wise men, not to
unsettle the minds of the ignorant people with their hints, words -
or actions, otherwise they would lose their faith and interest in
virtuous actions, and would give these up; which would lead
them to a downfall. Therefore, such people should be dissuaded
from a desire for fruit, rather than from. actions, prescribed by _
the scriptures. Jt is not only proper, but also indispensable, to
dissuade them from desire for the fruit of action, in order to
release them from the bondage of a cycle of birth and death. -

Appendix—Arjuna’s question was why the Lord urged him to
perform such a dreadful deed. The Lord answers his question in -
several ways by which He means to declare, “My aim is not to
engage you in a terrible deed but I want you to renounce your affinity
for actions.” Karmayoga aims at renouncing affinity for actions. :

Link:—The Lord, in the next verse explains, what a striver
should do to be free from attachment, to action and its fruit.

a striver believes that he has to perform obligatory actions, but
these lead him to bondage. In order to clarify his misconception, |
the Lord urges him to surrender all actions to Him, with :
discriminative insight, without having the least affinity for these.
In fact, all actions of the world, are performed by Lord's power. —
The body, senses, mind, objects and power etc., are, the Lord's
and the Lord is his. By thinking so, when a striver performs
actions, those actions instead of leading him to bondage, steer
him to salvation.
Every person, knows that he cannot keep the body, senses,
mind, intellect and material objects etc., under his control,
according to his desire. These belong to nature while the self is, -
a fragment of the Lord (Gita 15/7). So, real surrender consists in
accepting these as of the Lord's, rather than his own. Therefore, -
‘surrender’ means, the renunciation of assumed affinity, for objects
and actions, by attaching importance, to discrimination.
By the expression ‘adhyatmacetasa’, the Lord means to |
say, that one should have a spiritual aim (of God) rather
than a mundane one. The man who has fixed his aim, has a
discriminative insight. In fact, a man's aim or necessity is, to
attain the imperishable, (spiritual) while his desire is to gain
the perishable. A striver should decide upon the aim of his life,
instead of having a desire. |
From either the philosophical or the scientific point of view,
the egoistic notion that he is the doer, his 'Kriya’ becomes a ‘Karma’ which bears
threefold fruit—pleasant, unpleasant and mixed (Gita 18/12). But when he has no
notion of doership, his ‘Kriya’ does not turn into 'Karma' i.e., does not bear fruit,
it is performed just like an impulse (nature) (Gita 3/33).
"
401,"360 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3 7
material objects such as, body etc., cannot be proved to be one's

own. They have been bestowed upon him, so that he may make

its right use. But, when he lays a claim on them, he is bound.
Therefore, when a striver through discrimination, accepts the -
objects and actions as the Lord's, 1t means that he surrenders .
these to Him. |

In the verse, the expression 'Adhyatmacetasa’, has been
used specially. It means. that it is out of ignorance that the
perishable body or world, seems to be one’s own. If discrimination

_ is applied, the perishable body or world, cannot seem as one's :
own, only the Lord will appear as his own. Attachment to the
world, leads to degradation, while detachment leads to progress
(i.e., upliftment).

""The two lettered ‘Mama’ i.e., ‘this is mine’ is death and the _
three lettered 'Na Mama’ i.e., ‘this is not mine’ is immortality""
(Maha. Santi. 13/4), Aévamedhika 51/29).

The Lord urges a man to surrender all actions to Him because, 7
he considers the body, senses, mind, intellect, life-breath, material
and actions, his own and for himself. But in fact, these are neither |
his nor can be his. How can the perishable have affinity for the
imperishable? Therefore, surrender all actions either to the world
or to nature or to God, the result will be the same, as the world
is an evolute of nature and God, is the Lord of nature.Thus,
both the world and nature, belong to God. Therefore, a striver
should think, that he is God's and his so-called possessions, are |
also God's i.e., he should renounce his feeling of mineness to
these. In that case, he has to expect nothing, either from the
world or from God. The Lord Himself looks after his wants
(needs). When a striver, surrenders his body etc., to Him, these
do not seem, to him to be his own. If these appear to him to
be his own, it means that he has not surrendered them, to Him.
"
402,"Verse 30] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 361 -
Therefore, the Lord exhorts a striver to surrender these to Him, |
with a discriminative insight. Thus, when a striver surrenders
these to God, he comes to know the truth, that in fact these are
the Lord's, not his.
The fact of surrender to God, is so unique, that even if we -
surrender out of feeling of surfeit, it brings us immense benefit.
In fact, actions, objects, the body and the self, are not ones' own.
Actions can be surrendered even after their accomplishment.But
real surrender is achieved only when we renounce our affinity
with objects and actions. This abandonment is possible, when
we discern that instruments (body etc.,) objects, actions and the
embodied self, are only God's. A striver commits an error, that
he tries to surrender actions and objects to God, but he does not
surrender his body etc., and the self to Him. Thus his surrender,
remains incomplete. Therefore, a striver should think, that all the ~
objects including his body, senses, mind, intellect and the Self,
belong to God, which are really His.
A mere outward renunciation of actions and objects, ts not
real surrender. Real surrender, consists in regarding the objects
and possessions as His. If a striver surrenders these to God by ;
regarding these as his own, the Lord reciprocates by returning
these manifold, in the same way, as seeds sown, turn into a rich |
harvest. But, still it is in a limited amount. However, when he
surrenders these to Him regarding them as His, He offers Himself
to him, and also feels indebted to him.
The Lord is very much pleased with such a surrender. Even
when it does not help the Lord, in anyway. But its doing so
striver is released from the bondage of actions. When a child
hands over the key lying in a courtyard, to the father, the latter is
very much pleased with the baby and wishes it a long life. Why?
The reason is, that the child has good feelings, when it offers
the key to the father ever though it belongs to him. Similarly,
God is pleased with the striver, who offers all objects, the body
"
403,"362 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
and the self to Him, and is indebted to him.

The Lord has created the human body in a most unusual way, =
and the Lord by His grace has abundantly bestowed upon a human
being, the materials for his existence and spiritual practice including
discrimination. When man, disregarding his discrimination, uses
the things for his selfish motive, and has a desire to acquire more
things, he is enslaved and he has to follow the cycle of birth and
death. Every man knows the reality, that family, circumstances, .
ability, power, body, senses, mind and intellect etc., have been
acquired. These were neither his in the past, nor would remain
his, in the future, because they never remain the same, and are
ever-changing. If, having realized this fact, man ceases to depend _
on these, without attaching importance to them, he can attain
salvation, without any doubt. Attachment to these, is the root
cause of bondage. His attachment to these gives birth to several -
other desires, which lead him to sin, pain, sorrow and hell etc.

All these things, are perishable while the self is imperishable. So -
he should perform his duty by renouncing desires.

Here, a doubt may arise, how would he be inclined to act,
without desire. The clarification is, that a man is inclined to act
for the satisfaction of desires, as well as, to get rid of these. |
Common men perform actions, in order to satisfy their desires,
while strivers act for the purification of their souls, in order to
get rid of desires (Gita 5/11). In fact, actions are performed, in
order to get rid of desires rather than to satisfy them.

The aim of human life is to attain God. When this aim
is achieved, nothing more remains to be acquired. Only those
people, who have forgotten the real aim of human life i.e.,
God-realization, remain inclined to act, in order to satisfy their
desires. The Lord has called such people wretched or pitiful, as
they seek the fruits (of their actions) (Gita 2/49). On the other
"
404,"Verse 30] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 363 _
hand, those strivers, who perform actions by renouncing their
fruits, in order to be free from desires, have been called wise

(Gita 2/51).

The feelings of rendering selfless service, Self-realization and
God-realization, are aims, rather than desires, while the feeling ~
to acquire perishable objects, is desire.Therefore, it is wrong to
think, that a man is not inclined to act without desire. Actions
are performed scrupulously, in order to attain one’s aim.

Man (soul), is a fragment of God but his disinclination for
God and inclination towards the world, gives birth to necessity, as _
well as, desires.When he totally renounces his assumed affinity for |
the world, his necessity is fulfilled, and he gets rid of desires.

'Nirasirnirmamo bhiitva yudhyasva vigatajvarah'—When all
actions and objects are surrendered to God, even then a fragment
of desire as the sense of mine and grief, can remain. For example, -
if we offer a book to someone, and we see him studying that
book, we think that he is studying the book, given by us. In ;
order to free us from this minor attachment, the Lord urges us
not to have a desire to acquire anything, nor to be attached to
the acquired things and not to be grieved for the things lost. 7

- The criterion for surrender is, that a striver has no fragment of
desire, no feeling of mine and no grief. |

When a striver surrenders all actions and objects to God, :

sometimes because of past impressions (influences), he feels that
he has not got rid of desire, the sense of mineness and grief.
Such a striver need not lose heart, because only he who perceives
desire, the sense of mineness and grief, becomes free of them.
Similar, is the case with egoism. Every human being fully deserves
to get rid of desire, and a sense of mine and grief.

In the whole Gita the term 'Jvara’ (mental fever viz., grief)
has only been used here. In a war, a warrior is grieved at the
death of his kith and kin. Therefore, Lord Krsna directs Arjuna
to fight, delivered from grief, as his duty as a member of the
"
405,"364 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3  ~
warrior class. The Lord, means to say that a striver should |
perform his duty by surrendering it to God, and being free from
desire, a sense of mineness and grief. Remaining equanimous
in success and failure, pleasure and pain, a sense of mineness
and aversion etc., is known as a state of ‘Vigatajvarah' ~
(freedom from grief). In fact, all the mental defects, such as a
sense of mineness, aversion, worry, agitation and turmoil etc.,
are included in, 'Jvara’. -
When a striver has God-realization as the only goal of his life,
all his possessions and things, whether superior or inferior, are
surrendered tc God. Having surrendered his actions and objects,
he surrenders his desire, the sense of mineness and grief, which
appear in him, to God. Thus, he becomes a staunch devotee with -
exclusive devotion.
For a sage who wishes to attain Yoga, action is said to be the -
means (Gita 6/3), because, while performing action he comes to
know his defects, (desire, the sense of mineness etc.).* Therefore, -
(in the twelfth verse of the twelfth chapter) the renunciation of the
fruit of action, has been considered to be better than meditation.
The reason is, that in meditation a striver pays attention so that |
the mind is not volatile. When his mind is fixed, he regards it,
as his success and does not pay heed to other defects, such as
desire and sense of mineness etc. Therefore, the Lord in this
verse orders Arjuna to perform his duty of fighting, so that he
may come to know his defects also.
As the Lord (in the forty-eighth verse of the second chapter)
instructs Arjuna to perform his duty while being equanimous
in success and failure, here, He asks him to fight being free
* A volunteer offers his service being a member ofa voluntary committee. But
when he is honoured or praised, he relishes it i.e., derives pleasures out of it. This
is wrong. Thus such defects become known only. when actions are performed.
"
406,"Verse 30] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 365 -
from desire, the sense of mineness and grief. When even
such a savage deed as fighting, can be performed with
equanimity, what other action is there which cannot be
performed with equanimity? Equanimity can be attained by /
believing, ""I am neither my body, nor the body is mine nor is
it for me,"" which is also, a fact.
It is possible to do an act worth doing, only when a striver's
aim is focussed on God, and not on the world. As the striver .
advances gradually, on the path of God-realization, his vices,
like desire, myness and attachment etc., diminish automatically ~
and he experiences his Self to be positioned in equanimity. As
soon as the practice of equanimity gets perfect, the doership is
vanished completely and identification with the aim is established.
As a rule, the ego perishes when there remains no desire to do -
anything, for one’s own good gain. |
Arjuna wants to attain salvation, without performing his
duty, of fighting. When Arjuna asks for a way to salvation, -
the Lord orders him to fight, as it is his duty. According to the
Lord, salvation can be attained, through the path of action or .
knowledge or devotion.
Appendix—By now the Lord answered Arjuna’s question
(why do you urge me to perform such a dreadful deed?) in )
several ways. Now in this verse the Lord tells him the method
to perform actions through the path of devotion to God.
‘Surrender all actions to Me’—By this expression the Lord
means to say, “Without regarding actions and objects as yours
and for you, regard them as Mine and for Me.” The reason is that |
God is entire (complete) and all actions and objects (Adhibhita)
(matter) are within the entire form of the Lord (Gita 7/29-30).
Here the term ‘mayi’ (Me) has been used for the entire form
of the Lord.
In this verse by the expression, ‘mayi sarvani karmani
sannyasya’ Bhaktiyoga (the path of devotion); by the expression, :
"
407,"366 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 ~~
‘adhyatmacetasa’ Jnanayoga (the path of knowledge); and by |
the expression, ‘nirasimirmamo bhutva yudhyasva vigatajvarah’
Karmayoga (the path of action) have been mentioned.
Link:—Having outlined His teaching (principle) in the
preceding verse, in the next two verses, the Lord substantiates,
the same.

Sraddhavanto'nasityanto mucyante te'pi karmabhih
Persons who always follow this teaching of Mine, with faith _
and without question, are released from the bondage of all actions
(Karma). 31
Comment:— : -
""Ye me matamidam nityamanutisthanti manavah Sraddhavan-
to'nasiiyanto'—A person belonging to any caste, creed, sect and 7
order of life etc., who wants to be released from the bondage
of actions, should practise this teaching. By realizing the fact,
that the body, senses, mind, intellect, objects and actions |
etc., are not one's own, men are released from this bondage.
‘Sraddhavantah’, is he who has a firm faith in and devotion for
the Lord and His teaching.
A man is released from bondage, when he regards the material
objects, such as body etc., neither as his nor for him. Having
faith in this truth, it becomes easy to renounce the assumed |
affinity for the insentient.
A striver having faith, only listens to the divine discourses
and translates these into practice. This human body has been
bestowed upon us, so that we may realize God. So we should
try to arouse a yearning to realize Him. When this yearning is
"
408,"Verse 31] - SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 367
/
aroused, other virtues such as faith, promptness and self-control
» etc., are naturally inculcated in our mind. :
The Lord has laid emphasis on faith and also freedom
from petty objections, because even a man of faith can have a -
carping nature, to some extent. So the Lord urges strivers to be |
totally free from cavil. The Lord also lays emphasis on this very
fact, while glorifying the study of the Gita when He declares,
""A man who hears this gospel with faith and uncritically is
liberated (Gita 18/71). -
When a man holds that the teaching of the Lord is good, but
it reveals His boastful and egoistic nature; or how could actions
lead to salvation, when these are conducive to bondage—such
opinions show a man’s critical spirit. So, a striver should be free
from this sort of attitude. 7
In fact, all objects belong to the Lord, but by an error, a man |
regards these as his own and so he is enslaved. It is because of -
his attachment and desire, that he has to suffer. Therefore, the
Lord, out of His grace and affection, urges him to surrender all ;
actions and things to Him, so that he may attain eternal bliss,
though He lacks nothing, and is perfect.
The Lord's teaching is called, an universal doctrine. Here the |
Lord's teaching or discipline has been described by the term 'Matam’.
The Lord, out of His natural simplicity and absence of vanity,
has called the universal principle, as mere ‘Mata.’ His teachings
ever remain the same, without undergoing any modifications.
It depends, upon a man whether he has faith in it or not.
Here, the adjective 'nityam’ (constant) does not qualify 'Matam' |
(teaching) but it modifies ‘anutisthanti’ (practise) (follow), because
the Lord is eternal (constant) and so all objects pertaining to
Him, are also eternal. His teaching is also eternal. So the Lord
emphasizes that it should be practised constantly.
Question:—What is the doctrine of the Lord, and how should
it be practised (followed)? oo
"
409,"368 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
Answer:—All acquired things are not ours—this is the
considered view of the Lord. Whatever materials—body, senses,
mind, intellect, life-breath, riches, property, objects etc., there are,
these are the evolutes of nature and the world is also an evolute -
of nature. So, all of these have identity with the world; while the
self, being a fragment of God, has its identification with Him.
Therefore, all of these are not our personal possessions, but have —_
been bestowed upon us, so that we may utilize them properly.
Besides, these, the virtues such as good conduct, renunciation,
dispassion, kindness and forgiveness etc., are, also not personal; -
being divine traits they also belong to God. Had these been ours
these would have also remained with us and no one could have
acquired them, without our permission. But it is not so. When
“we accept these as ours, we are proud of these and pride isa = _
root of demoniac endowment. | |

When we regard a thing, which really is not ours, as ours,
it captures us. Materialistic things, such as body etc., are neither ~
ours nor for us. Had they been ours, they might have provided us
full satisfaction, when we acquired them. But these never satisfy -
us, and add fuel to desires. But if we realize God, we are fully
satisfied, and we attain perfection and nothing further remains to
be gained (acquired). As, a lost child is not pleased and satisfied |
with any other woman (though she is also a mother), except his —
own mother, similarly, we are not satisfied with any other state
except God-realization. Therefore, so long as we have the desire
to acquire something, it, means that we have not acquired our
very own object viz:, God.

We neither brought the worldly things with us, nor can we
carry these with us and at present also, these are deserting us,
constantly. While presently these are under our possession. It
behaves that, we use these for the welfare of the world, rather
than lay claim to them. The Lord is so generous and gracious,
that He bestows these upon us in, such a way, that they appear
to us to be ours. If we use them for our selfish motive, it means ee
"
410,"Verse 31] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 369
that we misuse His generosity and grace. Therefore, a striver in
order to rectify his error, should surrender these to Him, with a
discriminative insight.

If a striver whose only aim is God-realization, gives a serious -
thought to the topic, he will come to know the truth, that all |
the acquired things such as, the body, rank, right, education,
knowledge, riches and property etc., belong to the world, and so 7
they should be utilized, for the world. We may call them either
of the world or of nature, or of God, but these are not ours. So
how can they be for us. -

A striver has, neither to regard a thing as his, nor has to
perform any action for him. The actions, which are performed
by him for himself, bind him because the Lord declares, ""One
is bound by actions, other than those performed, for the sake of —
sacrifice (Yajiia)"" (Gita 3/9), ""Actions including the stored ones |
of the person who performs them for the sake of sacrifice are
dissolved entirely""(Gita 4/23). -
God is the almighty Lord of all the worlds (Gita 5/29).
When, a man regards himself as the lord of his objects and 7
possessions, he forgets the real Lord, and thinks of those objects
and possessions. Therefore, a striver should live like a servant
to the Lord, Who is the only master of the entire universe. By
becoming an instrument in His hands, he should perform his duty,
with the body, senses, mind, intellect and material bestowed upon
him by Him, without having any pride of ownership.
Having surrendered everything and action to God, he should
not be swayed, by the pairs of opposites, such as profit and |
loss, honour and dishonour, pleasure and pain etc., because these
are the gifts of God and so they are His. Performance of duty,
joyfully, under the available circumstance means, the practice
of His teaching.
""Mucyante te'pi karmabhih'—The Lord, seems to say to
Arjuna, that He was ordering him in clear terms to surrender
"
411,"370 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
actions to Him. By obeying Him, he will undoubtedly be released
from bondage. Moreover, if other people also, whom He has not
ordered this way practise His teaching, they will also be released
from bondage even though they may not believe in Him. .

Appendix—The Lord’s opinion is the real and foremost |
principle, within which all views and doctrines are included.
The Lord without pride with a simple and polite heart, calls His
principle (Siddhanta) as opinion (Mata). It means that the Lord __
has not insisted upon his opinion or the opinion of anyone else
but he has put forth his view being impartial. - |

An opinion is not universal but it is personal. Everyone can
express his opinion but a principle is the basic and supreme truth
of universal character which everyone has to follow. Therefore
there can be difference of opinion between the teacher and the -— ~~ |
pupil but there can’t be difference in principle. Sages, hermits
and philosophers name their opinion as ‘principle’ but in the
Gita the Lord names His principle as ‘Mata’ (opinion). There are >
differences in the opinions of sages, hermits, philosophers and
teachers etc., but the Lord’s opinion viz., principle is universally -
accepted without any difference of opinion.

Comment:—

'Ye tvetadabhyasityanto nanutisthanti me matam'—Having
shown the advantage of practising His teaching (in the thirty-first
"
412,"Verse 32] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 371
verse) here the term ‘tu’ (but) has been used, to distinguish those
who do not follow His teaching, from those who do follow.
Some people hold that as worldly, selfish people, want to
acquire worldly objects and also want to get profit themselves, -
similarly, the Lord wants all actions to be surrendered to Him
and also that He should be regarded, as the Lord. Those who
think so, find fault with His teaching. -
Similarly, ‘those who think that in worldly affairs, desire is
a must, and it is impossible to renounce attachment, aversion
and a feeling of mine, also slight His teaching. -
Those people who hanker after worldly pleasures and
prosperity and regard the body, objects and actions etc., as
theirs, and for them, do not follow His teaching.
‘Sarvajfianavimiidhan tan'—Those who do not follow the -
Lord's teaching are under delusion regarding worldly knowledge
(sciences, arts etc.). They remain engrossed, in inventions and
scientific discoveries, like motor cars, aeroplanes, radios, :
televisions etc. Similarly, they remain engaged in knowing about
painting, architecture, arts, crafts, mystical formulas, incantations, -
implements, different scripts and languages, custom traditions
and other developments. They are fully convinced, that there is
nothing beyond these things (Gita 16/11). Such people, are said :
to be under delusion regarding knowledge.
'Acetasah'—They are devoid of discrimination, because
they cannot distinguish the real from the unreal, righteous from
unrighteous, salvation from bondage and so on. They remain
ignorant, like animals. ""Of vain hopes, of vain actions, of vain
knowledge and senseless, they verily are"" (Gita 9/12).
""Viddhi nastan'—Know those human beings who do not follow
the Lord's teaching, to be doomed to destruction. It means, that
they will be subjected to the cycle of birth and death.
A man can attain salvation, upto the time of death
(Gita 8/5). Therefore, those people, who do not follow the Lord's :
"
413,"372 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
teaching in this life at present can follow it, at sometime in
future because of good company etc., and can attain salvation.
But if they do not follow His teachings even upto death, they
should be known to be doomed, to destniction, because they are
deprived of God-realization. | -

He, who does not follow the Lord's teaching, performs actions
out of attachment and aversion, which are his foes (Gita 3/34).
Transient objects and actions perish, but a man while performing __
actions, comes under the sway of attachment and aversion, which
lead him to lower births and hells. Therefore, the Lord declares, ~
that such a man will be doomed to destruction.

In the thirty-first verse, the Lord declares that those who
follow His teachings are released from the bondage of actions,
while in this verse He declares, that those who do not, follow oo
His teaching, are to be doomed to destruction. It means, that the
Lord urges upon people to follow His teachings, even if they do :
not believe in Him. If they do not follow His teaching, they will ._~
be doomed to. But if a striver, believing in Him, follows His
teaching, He offers Himself to him. If he, without believing in _
Him, follows His teaching, He leads him to salvation. It means,
that he who believes in Him, attains His love while he who
follows His teaching, attains salvation. |

beings follow their own nature. What them can restraint do? 33
Comment:—
'‘Prakrtim yanti bhitani'—All actions are performed, either
according to one's own nature or according to the Lord's principles, 8
(scriptural injunctions). One's nature can be of two kinds, either
free from attachment and aversion, or having attachment and
aversion. If a man, on his way, happens to see a notice board. |
His casting a glance at it, is, neither because of attachment nor
aversion, nor from an angle of principle. It happens through his
pure personal nature. We read a letter received from a friend, -
with some feeling of attachment, while that of an enemy with
aversion. We study sacred texts such as the Gita and the Ramayana,
according to the Lord's principle. The only aim of human life is
God-realization. Therefore, actions which are performed, with the _
aim of God-realization, are performed, according to His principles
i.e., according to the scriptural injunctions.
All actions, such as seeing, hearing, smelling, touching So
etc., are performed according to one’s nature and according to
His principle. Nature, free from attachment and aversion, is not -
faulty, while nature with attachment and aversion is. Actions,
which are performed out of attachment and aversion, bind a
man because they make his nature impure. On the other hand,
actions which are performed according to God's principles, lead
to salvation, because these purify one's nature. It is, because of
impure personal nature, that the assumed affinity for the world,
is not renounced. As soon as_ his nature is purified, the assumed
affinity is easily, renounced. |
Actions, are automatically performed, by the so-called body of
a wise man, because he has no sense of doership. All actions of a
striver, whose aim is God-realization, are performed, according to
the scriptural injunctions. As a greedy, person is always careful,
that he should not sustain any loss, a striver is always careful
lest he should perform an activity with attachment or aversion.
"
415,"374 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
By being careful, a striver's nature is purified and consequently,
he is liberated from the bondage of his actions.

Although, all actions are performed by modes of nature,
yet an ignorant man, whose mind is deluded by egoism, thinks -
that he is the doer (Gita 3/27). Affinity for objects and actions,
gives birth to attachment and aversion, which lead him on to the
cycle of birth and death. But, he who has no affinity for nature _
(prakrti), sees that the self is not the doer (Gita 13/29).

It is attachment for material objects, which influences a |
person to perform,.evil actions. For a striver, attachment is the
main cause of bondage. Attachment dwells in assumed egoism,
and appears in mind, intellect, senses and sense-objects.

2—The cosmic ego, a mode of nature—'Mahabhitanya-
hankarah' (Gita 13/5). The latter form egoism, is flawless, as it
is an instrument, like the mind, intellect and senses etc., while ~
the former kind, is defective. A wise man, does not identify the
self with the body, and so all his actions are performed by the
modes of nature ie., by the latter kind. But an ignorant man, ~
who regards the body, as 'T and ‘mine’, and all actions as his

- and for him, is, because the assumption of actions as his, and
for him, causes attachment.*

'SadrSarh cestate svasyah prakrterjiianavanapi'—A perfect soul,
being free from attachment and aversion, acts in accordance with
pure nature. He is not swayed by nature. As a learned man, speaks
a language which he knows, similarly, the Lord also, behaves in

* As the body automatically develops and changes, similarly all the actions
are naturally performed. But a common man remains engrossed in (practical)
actions because of attachment and aversion while a wise man being free from
attachment and aversion does not get engrossedinthem. | ,

accordance with His incarnation, as Rama or Krsna or a fish, a
tortoise or a hog etc., but does not remain completely under sway |
of nature (prakrti). Similarly, those enlightened souls who have |
renounced their affinity for matter (prakrti) may vary in their
nature, but are not swayed by it. So, their actions are nothing | -
more than gestures of action, while common men, who have not :
renounced their affinity for matter, act according to individual
natures (natural propensities) and remain completely under its sway.
Here the term ‘Svasyah’ implies, that the nature of a wise |
man is flawless, and so he is not under the sway of nature, he -
rather controls nature. Actions, bear fruits only when a man
performs these, with a sense of ‘doership' and selfishness. A
wise man, remains free from the vanity of doership and also
from selfishness. So actions performed by him, are pure and
even ideal, for other strivers. 7
Impression of the past, and the present births, influence ,
of parents, society, company, education, environment, study, -
adoration, thoughts, actions and feelings, make up a man's
nature. The nature, varies from person to person and everyone -
is free to make it pure. The nature of one enlightened soul, varies
from that of the other, but it is pure (free from attachment and
aversion). So they are not swayed by nature. On the other hand, .
the ignorant (having attachment and aversion) have to perform
actions by force according to their own evil nature, which they
themselves have acquired.
""'Nigrahah kith karisyati'—The wise men perform virtuous
actions enjoined by the scriptures according to their pure nature,
while the ignorant perform evil actions under the sway of their
bad nature.
When Arjuna wanted to abstain from fighting, the Lord says
to him, ""Thy nature will compel thee"" (Gita 18/59), ""Thou shalt
do even against thy will, fettered by thine, own acts, born of
thy nature"" (18/60).
"

As, a.-motor car cannot cross the limit of 100 miles per hour ©
in its speed, a wise man cannot act, against his pure nature. One
with an impure nature is like a damaged car. A damaged car
can be repaired in two ways— (i) by the driver himself, (ii) by
sending it to a workshop. Similarly, the impure nature can be ~—
purified in two ways— (i) through the performance of actions,
without attachment and aversion (Gita 3/34), (ii) through perfect
surrender to the Lord (Gita 18/62). If a motor car functions -
smoothly, it means that we are not under its control, but if it
breaks down it means, that we are affected by it. Similarly, a _
wise man, because of his pure nature, is not under the sway of
nature, while an ignorant man because of his impure nature, has
to act under the influence of nature.

A man, who attaches importance to worldly pleasures and
prosperity, is sure to have a downfall, even though he may be
learned. On the other hand, he who does not attach importance
to the insentient (matter) (prosperity and pleasure) and whose aim __
is God-realization, is surely, to have upliftment, even though he
is not learned. The reason is, that feelings, thoughts and actions
of a man, whose aim instead of enjoying worldly pleasures _
and prosperity, is God-realization, are conducive to his uplift
(salvation). Therefore, a striver, first of all should decide upon
the goal of his life—God-realization. Then, in order to attain that
aim, he should perform his duty, being free from attachment and
aversion. An easy method, of being. free from attachment and
aversion, is that we render service to others, with our acquired
materials such as body etc., without regarding these as ours and
for us, and without expectation of any reward. |

If a striver does not want to come under the influence of
nature, he should perform his duty, by fixing an ideal for himself.
The ideal (model) can be of two kinds— (i) The Lord's teaching

' (i1) Wise men's actions. By following, the Lord's teaching or
wise men's actions, a striver's nature is purified and he realizes
"
418,"Verse 33] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 377

God, Who is ever attainable. On the other hand, the man, who

without following the Lord's teaching or the wise men's actions,

performs actions out of attachment and aversion, is doomed to

destruction (Gita 3/32). -
As we cannot forcibly obstruct the course of a river, but

can turn it to another direction, similarly, we can tum the

flow of our actions, towards the welfare of others. When we -

perform acts for the welfare of others, then the direction is

towards the world, and we, the strivers, are liberated from the

bondage of actions. ee
Appendix—Even a wise man acts according to his nature. :

No one can act without being guided by the circumstantial

causes. As a teacher teaches a pupil alphabet (a, b, c) in

conformity with the standard of his pupil, similarly a wise man —

acts and behaves with a common man by putting himself in the

latter’s situation.
‘Cestate’—This term means that he does not perform actions -

but activities are naturally performed by him according to his

nature. The shaking of the leaves of a tree is not an action (sin -

or virtue) bearing fruit. Even so a man free from the sense of

doership has no incentive to perpetrate sinful or virtuous acts,

he can never commit a sin or virtue. |
The wise men remain engrossed in the welfare of others

because their nature as strivers has been to do good to

others—‘sarvabhutahite ratah’ (Gita 5/25, 12/4). Therefore

though nothing remains to be done, to be known and to be

attained by them, yet their nature is to do activities beneficent

to all. It means that when by remaining engrossed in the welfare

of others, their affinity for the world is totally renounced, they

have not to work for the welfare of others but because of the

natural inclination of the past, good is naturally done by them

as a matter of habit. |

Attachment and aversion of man abide in each and _
every sense-object through the feeling of agreeableness' or
disagreeableness towards its senses. Let no one come under
their sway, for they are his waylayers and foes. 34
Comment:— |
7 ""Indriyasyendriyasyarthe ragadvesau vyavasthitau'—Each sense ~-
has attraction for a pleasant aspect (ear, eye, skin, tongue and
nose for sound, sight, touch, taste and smell respectively), and
aversion for an unpleasant one. Oo
, In fact, attachment and aversion do not abide, in the
- sense-objects. If they had abode in the sense-objects, the same —
objects might have been pleasant (desirable) or unpleasant
(undesirable ) equally, to everyone. But it does not happen. Rain
is desirable for a farmer, but not so for a potter. Moreover, —
the same object is sometimes pleasant, while it is unpleasant at
other time, to the same person. Cool air, is pleasant in summer
| but unpleasant in winter. Thus, we have attraction and aversion —
by regarding these as desirable and undesirable. Therefore, the
Lord has declared, that attachment and aversion of man abide
in the sense-objects.
In fact, attachment and aversion abide in assumed ‘ego'
(Tness).* The assumed affinity for the body is called ‘ego’. So
_ * Theterm ‘Asya’ in the expression ‘Rasavarjam raso'pyasya (Gita 2/59) used
by Lord Krsna also denotes that attachment and aversion abide in the assumed
‘ego’ (in a striver).
"
420,"Verse 34] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 379 -
long as, there is assumed affinity for the body, attachment and
aversion, exist in ‘ego’ and appear to be abiding in the intellect,
mind, senses and objects of senses. These attachment and aversion
in their gross forms have been called ‘desire’ and ‘anger’ (from _
the thirty-seventh to the forty-third verses of this chapter). In -
the fortieth verse, it has been said, that this desire exists in the |
senses, the mind and the intellect, because it appears to abide in
them. As attachment and aversion appear to subsist in the sense- a
objects, similarly attachment and aversion appear to inhabit in
senses, mind and intellect. In fact, the senses, the mind and the —
intellect are merely instruments. So, there is no question of the
desire and anger or attachment and aversion existing in them. |
Besides this, the Lord declares in the fifty-ninth verse of the
second chapter, ""The objects of the senses turn away, from the
man who abstains from feeding on them but the taste for them a
remains. Even the taste turns away when the Supreme is seen.""

'Tayorna vasamagacchet'—The Lord assures strivers, that they -
should never be disappointed, in the means and ends, if attachment
and aversion appear. The scriptures, rather than attachment and -
aversion, should be the authority for determining what should be
done and what should not be done (Gita 16/24). If a striver acts or |
abstains from action, with attachment and aversion, 1t means that
he is affected by attachment and aversion. If a person performs
actions, or abstains from actions with attachment and aversion, :
attachment and aversion, are strengthened. This strengthening,
leads a man to a downfall.

When a striver starts worship, renouncing the worldly affairs,
good and bad thoughts of the world come to his mind, and he
gets perturbed. The Lord urges him not to be perturbed, because .
these are perishable, and appear and disappear. In fact, thoughts
have no existence of their own, because as a rule what is born
must die. In fact, these thoughts do not come to mind, these
rather, slip away from the mind. Thoughts remain suppressed,
"
421,"380 _ SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 -
when a man is busy with worldly affairs, but when he stops _
his work, the suppressed thoughts, have an outlet. Therefore, a
striver, without having attachment or aversion, should remain
indifferent to these. Similarly, he should have neither attachment
nor aversion, for persons and things etc. -
When actions are performed, out of attachment and aversion, -
attachment and aversion are strengthened and these are transformed
into impure nature. This impure nature, brings a man under its _
sway. Then the actions performed by him, bind him. So, during
the performance or non-performance of actions, a striver should
not come under their influence. This is the means, to obliterate
attachment and aversion, which is explained here. Previous to
this, the Lord also declared, another means. The Lord said, ""Those -
who constantly follow this teaching of Mine, are released from
bondage of actions” (Gita 3/31). So a striver should follow His
teachings, so that he may get rid of attachment and aversion. ~
When a striver surrenders, his actions, body, senses, mind,
intellect and himself to God, and performs his duty free from -
desire, egoism and grief, his attachment and aversion perish. So
a person should follow His teachings, while he performs actions
or abstains himself from actions. -
The entire universe is an evolute of nature and a body is
| a fragment of the universe. So long as a man is attached to a
body, he comes under the sway of attachment and aversion, while
acquiring and abandoning things etc. When actions are performed
or abandoned with attachment and aversion, the performance or
non-performance of those strengthen attachment and aversion.
But if these are either performed or abandoned according to the
scriptural injunctions, attachment and aversion perish. If a person
does not know the ordinance of the scriptures, he should keep
in mind, the great sage Vedavyasa's teaching—""O men, listen to
the gist of righteousness and follow it. The gist is—We should
"
422,"Verse 34] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 381 -
not do to others, what we do not wish to be done to us (Padma |
Purana, Srsti. 19/355-56).
Liberated souls always follow the scriptural injunctions.
That is why Bhisma Pitamaha, offered food and water to the
manes on kuSa grass, though his father's hand was clearly visible -
to him (Mahabharata, AnuSasana. 84/15—20). Therefore, a
striver should perform, all actions according to the ordinance
of the scriptures. _
For a striver who wants to get rid of attachment and aversion,
the scripture is the authority for determining what should be done. _
The heart of an enlightened soul, totally free from attachment
and aversion, is so pure, that his thoughts, feelings and actions
are nothing but, the ordinances of scriptures,* even 1f he may be
illiterate. Thus his words and actions are exemplary (Gita 3/21)
and by following such teaching and actions, strivers get rid of ~
attachment and aversion. |
Some people believe that attachment and aversion, are natural -
tendencies (natural inclinations of the mind) which cannot be
wiped out, but it is wrong, as these appear and disappear. When
a striver practises spiritual discipline, they become bearer—it is :
every striver's experience; and whatever grows scarce, may perish
altogether. The Lord has declared, that these come to mind (Gita
2/55) but do not stay there permanently. Moreover, He has called :
these as modifications, (Gita 13/6) which have a beginning and
an end, rather than 'Dharmas'. Evenness of mind, 1n the desirable
and the undesirable, has been called spiritual discipline (Gita
13/9). Had attachment and aversion, been permanent features of
the mind, it could not have attained, the state of evenness. This :
means that they come to the mind and can be wiped out.
* The heart of the person who never renounces righteousness also becomes
pure. Great poet Kalidasa while describing king Dusyanta declares—""Where
there is doubt, there the inclination of the heart of a virtuous person is the
testimony"" (Abhijfianagakuntalam 1/21).
"
423,"382 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 3 -
A man, through discrimination, knows that nature (matter) .
prakrti and Soul (spirit) are different from each other. But, the
soul identifies itself with the body (born of nature), and this
identification is called 'ego' (1) in which attachment and aversion
exist, and both these strengthen egoism. These—(attachment and -
aversion) seem to abide in the intellect, because of which one's
own beliefs appear pleasant, while the beliefs of others unpleasant.
These seem to abide in the mind, and what one thinks as desirable, -
while what others think, is undesirable. These seem to also in
senses, due to which favourable objects seem pleasant, while _
unfavourable ones appear unpleasant. These may also appear,
in the objects of senses (sound, touch, sight, taste, smell), as
favourable and unfavourable. When egoism (identification of
the self with the body) is rooted out, attachment and aversion,
totally perish, because egoism is their base. -
‘Tam a servant’, 'I am an inquisitive learner’, 'I am a devotee'
etc., this is how one may feel. These me—a ‘servant’, ‘learner’ and -
‘devotee’, reside in the same 'T' in which attachment and aversion,
co-exist. Attachment and aversion, abide neither exclusively in
inert nor in conscious state. These live, only in assumed, relation :
between the inert and conscious, yet these live mainly, in the
inert. In the state of identification of soul with the matter, the
material part is attracted towards matter alone, but it appears also |
in the conscious soul, due to this identification. Attraction for the
insentient (matter) is attachment. When a striver identifies the
self with the body, he feels difficulty, in renouncing attachment
and aversion. But when he has an eye on the Self, he has no
difficulty in renouncing attachment and aversion, because these
have no existence of their own. These are bom, only when one
identifies the self with the body etc.
If a striver has attachment for good company, adoration and
meditation etc., he has aversion for the world. But if he has ‘love’
(devotion) for God, he will have no aversion for the world, but
"
424,"Verse 34] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 383 -
he will be indifferent to the world.* | /

If a man has attachment for one object, he has aversion for
an other, but when he has love (devotion) for God, he develops
dispassion. Dispassion, leads to selfless service by. wiping out
desire for pleasure. Then the body, senses, mind, intellect and .
ego, are automatically engaged in the service of the world.
Consequently, attachment and aversion, which abide in ego,
totally perish when affinity to the self for the body etc., along -
with ego, is renounced. |

All actions of a person, are performed according to his -
nature or according to scriptural injunctions. If something
is done, with a view to spiritual progress only, it is done in
obedience to the above rule. Nature, can be pure (free from
attachment and aversion) and impure (with attachment and
aversion). It cannot be totally renounced, but it can be purified SO
1.e., made free from attachment and aversion. As the course of
the Ganges cannot be forcibly obstructed, but its direction can /
be changed, similarly, action cannot be totally renounced, but
their flow (course) can be changed i.e., can be made free from
attachment and aversion. This is a vital teaching of the Gita. -
It is, neither the performance nor non-performance of actions,
but attachment and aversion, which are the stumbling blocks to
a striver's spiritual progress. So, the Lord declares, that a wise :
man, is he who has neither attachment for agreeable actions nor
aversion for disagreeable ones (Gita 18/10). Generally, strivers

* Whether a striver has attachment or love (devotion) to holy company can be |
illustrated by the following example:—If anybody creates an obstacle to a striver's
good company, adoration or meditation and he gets angry with him, it means that |
he has attachment. But if he feels sad, it means that he has love. The reason is that
there are obstacles to the spiritual discipline when his determination 1s not firm.
So he is sad because of his shortcoming. Similarly, if he is biased against any
religion or sect, it means that he is attached to his own religion or sect.

In fact even attachment to the good company, adoration and meditation
is not bad because this spiritual practice leads the mind to the thought of God
(Srimadbhi. 7/1/31).
"
425,"384 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 ~
are not on their guard against attachment and aversion. Their |
activities come under the sway of these. Therefore, a striver
should perform actions, according to scriptural ordinances in
order to be free from attachment and aversion. By doing so his
nature will automatically, be improved. 7
When desire mixed with attraction or aversion, 1s born,
and we act according to its dictates, attraction and aversion, get
strengthened and if we act according to the principles enunciated °
these get wiped out.
When good and evil thoughts come to the mind of a striver, ~
he should neither have attachment nor aversion for these, he
should neither support nor oppose these. He should remain
indifferent by thinking that he (the self) is different and so the
self has no affinity, for these. -
If a striver finds himself helpless, in renouncing attachment
and aversion, he should take refuge in the omnipotent Lord, Who
is his most disinterested friend. By His grace, he overcomes -
attachment and aversion (Gita 7/14) and attains supreme peace (Gita
18/62). The assumption is that the body, senses, mind, intellect, 7
ego and all the worldly objects belong to the Lord, take refuge
in Him. So, a striver should serve Him, in order to please Him
offer the materials provided by Him,without expecting any reward.
Expectation of a reward leads to affinity for the insentient (matter).
‘Service to others, without expecting any reward’, 1s the
means to wipe out attachment and aversion. All our possessions,
including the physical, subtle and causal bodies, as well as
ego, are to render service to the world, because these are
essentially the same, as is the world. An assumption, that
these are different from the world, leads to bondage. A striver,
should not derive pleasure out of things and actions, with a
physical body, out of thinking, with the subtle body and out of
trance with the causal body. In fact, this human body is not for
pleasures (Manasa 7/44/1).
"
426,"Verse 34] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 385 -
— Secondly, the body, senses, mind, intellect and objects etc.,

with which service is rendered, are fragments of the world. How
can fragments of the world be ours when the world is not ours?
We cannot render service to others with these in a disinterested
way, if we regard these as ours. Therefore, we should regard -
these as, of those whose service 1s rendered with these. A devotee ,
surrenders these to God, by regarding these as His. Similarly,
a Karmayog! surrenders these to the world, by regarding these -
as the world's.

He alone can render true service to others, who never requires
anything for himself. The desire for money in lieu of service, is
no doubt a desire, but an inclination to serve, is also a desire, -
because it results in a desire for riches. A striver, should not have
a desire to acquire money, even for rendering service, to others.
If he gets an opportunity, he should render service according to -
his resources, but he should have no desire to render service. He
who derives pleasure by rendering service to others, or has the -
sentiment that people are benefited by him, or expects honour
and praise, or gets pleased by receiving honour and praise, in
reality enjoys pleasures, instead of rendering true service. If a
striver derives pleasure out of this, it gives birth to attachment
and desire. In fact, the objects with which he renders service to
others, belong to them. So, there is no obligation if their trust
property is returned to them. Does anyone want reward for having
washed his face with his own hands?

Question:—How can service be rendered without objects and
money etc? So, what is the harm if anyone desires money and
objects, in order to render service to others?

Answer:—Service, with material objects is, a gross type of
service. Real service is a sentiment or feeling, and not an action.
Action leads to bondage, while service, releases from bondage.
"
427,"386 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3 -
A sense of service impels a man to use his possessions, in the .
service of others. Real service is rendered through feelings, rather ,
than through actions. A man of generous feelings can render
service even with limited resources, he has. He, who attaches
importance to objects cannot render service, with these, because -
he has pride in doing so, and thus he derives pleasure out of his
action, whether he knows it or not. A shopkeeper, gives articles
to others, but he does not render service, because he has a desire -
to receive money in exchange. Similarly, money which 1s paid as
tax to the king (state), cannot be called, charity. If a person offers -
charity or food or water to someone, in order to reap its fruit,
his affinity for the object is not renounced. But, if he offers the
articles, without expecting any reward, it means that he renders
service and his affinity for those objects, is renounced.
Only he who lays claim to a thing i.e., is the real owner of
a thing, can receive such a thing given by us. We, repay debt,
by offering the thing back to him. He, who is in greater need of -
something actually, is a deserving hand to receive it. He takes
it from us, only if it is his, otherwise not. ;
He, who renders service to others from his heart, arouses
feelings of service in their hearts also. If, this feeling is not
aroused in their hearts, it means that there has been a flaw (such _
as of reaping the fruit) in the service. A striver, should be on
the alert, in this respect. While rendering service, he should
never expect to be called, virtuous or good, because this feeling
develops pride in him.
A striver, should live in the world, in order to render service
to others by performing his duty. He should never cause any harm /
to anyone, in the least. He should share the joys and sorrows
of others, because that gives them moral strength, that there 1s
someone who is sharing their joys and sorrows. In this way,
happy men will become happier and the sad will be consoled.
He should console the sad, by quoting Lord Rama, king Nala and |
"
428,"Verse 34] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 387 -
king Hariscandra etc., who had to face adverse situations, though

they were very noble and virtuous. Moreover, there are many

others who are in a more pitiable condition. Thus one should try

to console them, be prepared to help them and remain engaged |

in their welfare, by having good feelings. Those, who share the :
pleasures and pains of others, are saints (Manasa 7/38/1).

Now a doubt may arise, that we shall never be free from
sorrow, if we share the sorrow of other people, because the world /
is full of it. To share, the sorrow of others, means to have the
feeling to alleviate their suffering and to make efforts for it. This ~
will give us happiness, rather than make us sad. The explanation
is, that other people will also share our sorrows i.e., they will
try to help us, in doing away with our sorrow. So, we should
try to share the sorrow of others from our heart, and according .
to our resources. When we share their sorrow, all our resources
are automatically, utilized, to relieve them of their sorrow and
suffering. It is beyond our power to make others happy, but it is -
upto us to use our resources, in order to help the sad in removing
their sorrow. This renunciation of the means of happiness, will -
bring us peace of mind. ;:

A striver should always have the feeling that no. one should
ever suffer in the least. Everyone is free, in having such generous |
feeling. This feeling is a service itself. Actions and objects are
limited, while feeling of generosity, is unlimited. So a striver can
attain the unlimited Lord, by unlimited feelings. How can He be
attained by the limited resources such as actions and objects?
Therefore, those whose possessions and resources are limited,
can also render great service, by having generous feelings.

A striver, who does not regard the body, senses, mind and
intellect etc., as his, can share the joys, and sorrows of others. In
fact, the body, senses, mind and intellect etc., are neither his nor
for him. Similar, is the case with objects, resources and persons.

These are also not his personal property. Everyone, whether he is
"
429,"388 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 ;
rich or poor, educated or uneducated, can renounce this assumed
affinity for these. As soon as, this assumed affinity is renounced,
and one renders service to others, by those things regarding them
as theirs, he gets rid of attachment and aversion, easily. -
‘Tau hyasya paripanthinau’—In the spiritual discipline,
attachment and aversion, are the waylayers to rob a striver, of
his spiritual property. But, a striver does not pay heed to this fact.
Therefore, he does not progress in the spiritual field as much as
he should have. Generally, strivers complain that they cannot
concentrate their minds, on God. But this lack of concentration -
is not such a stumbling block, as are attachment and aversion.
When attachment and aversions are renounced, the mind can
easily concentrate.
_ Total renunciation of actions, pertaining to one's nature, -
is beyond a striver's power, but their performance without
attachment and aversion, is within his power. So, the Lord |
urges strivers, not to come under their sway for these are his -
waylayers. In fact, attachment and aversion are naturally perishing.
But, a striver by holding that they dwell in him, accepts their -
existence and then acts, by coming under their influence. So he
does not get rid of them. If he holds that they do not dwell in
him and so he does not act, being swayed by them, these will :
automatically perish.
Appendix—When we assume that others are instrumental in
providing pleasure and pain to us, then attachment and aversion
ensue viz., we get attached to the thing which we think provides
pleasure to us and have aversion to the thing which provides pain |
to us. Therefore attachment and aversion are born by one’s own
error, there is no other reason. It is because of attachment and
aversion that we fail to perceive the world as the manifestation
of God but we view it as insentient (inert) and perishable. If
attachment and aversion are rooted out, it is not insentient but
all manifests as God—‘vasudevah sarvam’ (Gita 7/19). —
"
430,"Verse 34] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 389

When evils such as attachment and aversion appear, one
should not come under their sway viz., he should not perform
forbidden actions being swayed by them. Being affected by them,
if actions are performed, the evils (flaws) will be strengthened. -
But if actions are not done being swayed by them, the man will
be filled with enthusiasm. For example, if anyone uttered bitter
words to .us but we didn’t get angry, we would be filled with 7
enthusiasm and joy that we could escape anger. But we should
hold that it was not done by our own power; but by God’s grace
otherwise we would have been overpowered by it. If a striver -
perceives any defect, he should not be under its sway and should
not assume it in him. If attachment and aversion had existed
in the self, they would have remained as long as the self had
existed. But this is everyone’s experience that we ever exist but _
attachment and aversion don’t stay forever, they are fleeting.
Attachment and aversion can’t have an access to the self because
the self’s category is quite different from that of attachment and -
aversion. He, who knows the fleeting nature of attachment and
aversion, is different from them. Therefore attachment and aversion -
are different from us and they are also different from the mind
and intellect etc., in which they make a visit—‘manogatan’
(Gita 2/55). ‘Indriyasyendriyasyarthe ragadvesau vyavasthitau’— .
this expression means that a man should not be attached to
desirable or undesirable circumstances but should make proper
use of them viz., in desirable circumstances he should serve
others while in undesirable circumstances he should give up the
desire for favourable circumstances. The expression ‘tayorna vaSa- .
magacchet’ means that he should not be happy and sad in
favourable and unfavourable circumstances. To feel happy and
sad means to be attached to the fruit of action and the person
who is attached to the fruit of action gets tied down—‘phale
sakto nibadhyate’ (Gita 5/12).

'Sreyan*svadharmo vigunah paradharmatsvanusthitat'—The -
duty of another person according to his caste, order of life, —
etc., may outwardly seem full of merit, be easy to perform,
be attractive, provide riches, comforts, honour and praise etc., -
and enable one to live with comfort throughout his life, yet as
forbidden to him. These are fraught with fear (pain). On the other
hand, one's own duty, according to one's caste and order of life,
may be devoid of merit, be difficult to perform, not appealing and
not providing riches, comforts, honour or praise etc., and may be ;
painful, throughout life, yet these should be performed without
expecting any reward, as these leads to salvation. Therefore, a
person should always perform his duty, without expecting any ~
reward, without a sense of ‘mine’ and without attachment.
Performance of duty, for a man is but natural and innate. A
man is born, according to his actions, and actions are decided,
by his birth (Gita 18/41). Through the performance of his own
duty, he attains perfection (Gita 18/45). Therefore, one should
not give up one's duty ordained by one's nature, even if it seems
* The term ‘Jyayasi' (Superior) (3/1) used in the question put by Arjuna and
the term 'Sreyan' are synonymous. It means that the Lord has answered Arjuna's
question in this verse with particular attention. |
"
432,"Verse 35] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 391 -
to be tainted with blemish (Gita 18/48).

Arjuna thinks, it is better to live in this world by begging,
than to fight (Gita 2/5). So the Lord makes it clear to Arjuna, that
begging being the duty of a beggar, is not his duty, because he _
is a Ksatriya (a member of the warrior class), and not a beggar. |
In the first chapter, when Arjuna said that only sin would accrue
to them by fighting (1/36), the Lord said, that having abandoned
his own duty and forfeited his fame, he would incur sin (2/33). -
Further, the Lord declared, ""Treating alike pleasure and pain,
gain and loss, victory and defeat, engage thou in battle; thus, -
thou shall not incur sin"" (2/38). In the eighteenth chapter also
He declares, ""Better is one’s own duty though devoid of merit,
than the duty of another well performed and he who performs
his duty ordained by one's own nature, incurs no sin"" (18/47). _
It means, that a man incurs sin only when duty is performed
with attachment and aversion. When a striver performs his duty :
scrupulously, being free from attachment and aversion, he realizes :
equanimity, which leads him to freedom from sorrow and pain (Gita
6/23). So the Lord urges Arjuna, time and again, to perform his -
duty of fighting without attachment and aversion. By performing
his duty he would be detached from actions, develop dispassion,
and attain the goal of life. Through the selfless performance of ;
duty, actions flow towards nature (prakrti) and so a striver has
no affinity for these. Therefore, a striver should perform his duty,
with the view to root out attachment, for actions.

Lord Krsna is convincing Arjuna that having taken birth
in the warrior class and fighting is his duty he had to treat
alike victory and defeat, gain and loss, and pleasure and pain
believing that he had no concern as such with war but he had to
act in order only, to remove attachment with actions. The body,
senses, mind, intellect and matter etc., are meant for performing
duty alone.

One's duty done according to one’s caste and order of life, ,
"
433,"392 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
even though it may appear devoid of merit, leads to salvation.

A Ksatriya's duty of fighting, which involves violence may seem |
devoid of merits as compared with that of a Brahmana such as
serenity, self-restraint, austerity, purity and forgiveness etc., yet _
a Ksatriya (member of the warrior class) should fight, as it will

lead him to salvation.

According to one's caste and order of life etc., outwardly = __
actions (duties) may seem terrible or mild, but these are performed :
with the only aim of God-realization. When a person forgets the
real aim of life i.e., God-realization and attaches importance to -
worldly objects, actions seem terrible or mild to him. Under no
circumstances should one, discard his duty.

'Svadharme nidhanam éreyah'— If people ever gained, comfort,
pleasure, property, riches, honour and praise etc., by performing ~
their duty, there could be seen crowds of righteous people. But,
duty is not performed, keeping in view pleasure or pain, but
it is performed according to the teachings of the Lord or the ;
scriptures, without expecting any reward. So, while performing
his duty, if a striver suffers pain, that pain leads him to his 7
spiritual progress. In fact, that pain is not pain, but is penance or
austerity, which is conducive to progress, as penance is performed
for ones own self, while duty is performed for others. Penance :
which is performed intentionally, does not prove so beneficial,
as penance, in the form of pain, which comes uninvited.Those
who die while performing their duty, become immortal. From
the worldly point of view also, it is observed, that those who
do not deviate from their duty in spite of suffering pain, are
admired and honoured. Patriots who suffered tortures, went to
jail and were hanged, in order to make the country independent, _
are praised and honoured even today. On the other hand, those
who are sent to jail, because of their crimes are condemned and
dishonoured. It means, that the person who performs his duty
without expecting any reward, may suffer pain and even may meet
"
434,"Verse 35] : SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 393 7
with death, but that pain wins honour and praise here, and leads .
him to salvation hereafter, because he has an eye on righteousness.
Question:—How to know for certain, that death while )
performing one's own duty, leads only to salvation?
Answer:—The Gita is a gospel of Lord Krsna Himself. So, -
there should not arise any doubt, about His teaching. Secondly
it is a matter of faith and belief, rather than reasoning, yet some
aspects clarify the doubts: .
(1)—Whatever, is not known to us should be decided
by the scriptures.* It is mentioned in the scriptures, that he _
who protects righteousness, is protected by the righteous
(Manusmrti 8/15) ie., righteousness leads him to salvation.
Therefore, the responsibility of salvation of a person, who
follows righteousness falls on the righteous and the preachers
of righteousness, such as God, the Vedas, the scriptures and —
the sages and ascetics. It is their power which leads one to
salvation. In the scriptures, it is mentioned that a chaste woman,
attains salvation. She does not attain salvation, because of the -
virtues of her husband and his power, but because of the power
of the Lord, the Vedas and the scriptures etc., who have made -
this law (ordinance). There is no doubt about it.
(2) History also reveals the fact, that he who performs his
duty with righteousness attains salvation. King Hariscandra did not
deviate from truth, in the face of adversity, insult and dishonour.
Consequently, he along with his subjects attained the Supreme
Abode (Markandeya Purana, Devibhagavata etc.).
(3)—Nowadays we come across many incidents of rebirth,
which reveal that creatures take to higher or lower births according |
to their good or bad deedst.
* The scripture which removes doubts and reveals secrets, gives us all the light
of knowledge. Therefore, he who has no knowledge of the scriptures, is blind.

(4) Not to speak of a believer, even a non-believer, by — -
performing his duty scrupulously, without any selfish motive,
gains peace or joy, which is a characteristic of the mode of _
goodness. This peace, is a signal for salvation or the supreme peace.
Therefore, our own experience proves, that performance of one's .
duty while discarding forbidden actions, leads to salvation. |

It is the real duty of a man (the self), being a fragment of __
the Lord, to attain salvation and to believe, that he is, only the
Lord's and only the Lord is his. Even duty, according to one’s = —™
caste, stage of life and body etc., are not real duties because
these are assumed, and are not of the self. In all of these, a
man has to depend on others, while in one's own real duty,
he is totally independent and without the least dependence, on
anyone. Therefore, a striver himself may be a lover, a seeker of
knowledge or a devotee, as he has not to depend on anyone else.

A lover, transmuted by love, becomes one with the Beloved; a
seeker of knowledge, transmuted by knowledge, becomes one with

Him Who is all Knowledge, and a servant changed by service, -
becomes one with the Master. Similarly a striver transformed by
Sadhana, (Spiritual discipline) becomes one with God.

A striver having the aim of God-realization, does not hanker ;
after riches, honour, praise, comforts and luxuries. He is not at |
all worried about these, nor is he pleased having acquired them,
because his aim is only God-realization, rather than acquisition
of riches, honour and praise etc. So all the worldly actions, are
performed scrupulously and solemnly, for the Lord's sake by
him. As a businessman, takes a lot of trouble, to earn more and
more money, and as a patient, undergoes an operation happily,
in order to recover from a disease; a striver remains pleased and
satisfied, even in defeat, loss and pain, in order to attain his aim
of God-realization. For him, the desirable and the undesirable
circumstances, are the means to practise spiritual discipline.
"
436,"Verse 35] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI | 395 _

When a sStriver, having resolved to realize God, starts :
performing his duty scrupulously, he does not deviate from the
performance of his duty, even in the face of adversity. He faces
that adversity happily, taking it to be a penance.

When a striver, assumes the body as 'T and ‘mine’, it submits ~
to attachment and aversion. While coming under the sway of
attachment and aversion, a man strays away from his duty. Had
the body been 'T (the self), it would have remained with the self, -
or the self would have been destroyed with the destruction of
a body. But it is not so. Similarly, if the body had been mine, _
nothing would have remained to be acquired, after acquiring it.

But, the desire to acquire more, continues. It means that the real

thing has not yet been acquired, and the acquired things, such as

the body etc., are not mine. How can the body be mine, when I

have neither brought it with me, nor can carry it with me, nor -

can change it as I desire? Thus, every striver knows that a body

is neither ‘he' nor ‘his’. But the strivers do not attach importance

to this knowledge, so they cannot get rid of attachment and ;

aversion. If a striver sometimes, happens to feel a body as 'T'

and ‘mine’, he should instead of attaching importance to this -

feeling, give importance to his knowledge. By this, he realizes

the self, and then he gets rid of attachment and aversion. Being

free from attachment, the knowledge, of what ought to be done
_ and what ought not to be done, is naturally revealed in his mind

and accordingly actions are performed.

‘Paradharmo bhayavahah'—Though the performance of
duty of another, appears easy, yet it is fraught with fear 1.e., its
consequence is disastrous. Having discarded, selfish motive, if
a man performs his duty for the good of others, there is no fear
for him, from any quarters. |

Question:—Having described the duties, of Brahmanas
(priest class), Ksatriyas (warrior class), Vaisyas (trader class)
and Sidras (labour class) in the forty-second, forty-third and
"
437,"396 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 _
forty-fourth verses respectively, the Lord, in the first half of the ~
forty-seventh verse declared, ""Better, is one's own duty destitute
of merit, than the duty of another well performed."" According to
the present verse, the duty of another is said to be fraught with |
fear. Therefore, the duty of a Brahmana should be disastrous -
for others, such as the Ksatriya etc. But scriptures advise all |
people to inculcate the inborn qualities of a Brahmana in their
lives. Why? | -
Answer:—Controlling of the mind and senses etc.,
(Gita 13/7—11; 16/1—3) are common duties, which should be -
performed by everyone. These are natural duties for a Brahmana,
so he can perform these easily, while members of other castes,
may not perform these so easily. Common duties are also a part
and parcel of natural duties. Besides the common duties, when
a man performs duties born of his nature, he does not incur _
sin, though it may appear that he incurs sin. For example, if
a Ksatriya fights valiantly without selfishness and malice, by
regarding it as his duty he incurs no sin. The Lord declares,""He -
who performs his duty ordained according to his nature, incurs
no sin” (18/47). Besides common duty and one's own duty, the _
duty of another is fraught with fear, because it is prohibited by
scripture. It will deprive other persons of their rightful means
of livelihood, and it will lead him to hell. Therefore, the Lord -
asks Arjuna to perform his duty of fighting, which is better than
begging. Begging, is prohibited for Arjuna, being a Ksatriya it
is not beneficial for him.
Nature (prakrti) and its evolute (body and world), are different
from God and the self (soul). Duty of the self is one's duty,
while the duty of nature, the body and the world, is the duty of
another. Absence of modification, flawlessness, imperishability,
eternity, desirelessness and non-attachment, are duties of the
self, while modifications, flaws, transitoriness, mortality and
"
438,"Verse 35] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 397
desires for pleasures, prosperity, honour and praise etc., are the |
duties, of the body and the world and therefore, are the duties
of another. The duty of the self is imperishable, because the self
is imperishable, while the duty of the body is perishable, as the
body ever undergoes change. -

Renunciation, (the Discipline of Action), knowledge (the
Discipline of Knowledge) and love (the Discipline of Devotion),
being axiomatic, are one's own duty. These need no practice, as
practice is done by the body and whatever has affinity for the :
body, is the duty of another. |

To be united with God, is one’s own duty, while to be a -
pleasure seeker, is the duty of another; to remain detached is
one's duty, while to be attached is the duty of another; to render
service is one’s own duty while to have desire is the duty of
another; to be a lover is one's own duty while to be passionate ~
is the duty of another. It means, that whatever 1s connected
with the self is, one’s own duty, while whatever is connected
with nature (prakrti), is the duty of another. One's own duty is 7
sentient, while the duty of another is insentient.

The self is a fragment of God while the body is a fragment -
of nature (prakrti). The desire for Self-realization and God-
realization, is the duty of the self, because the self is a fragment
of God, while the desire for pleasure and prosperity is the duty :
of another (paradharma). This desire for pleasure and prosperity,
is aroused by accepting affinity for an unreal body. A desire
for one's ultimate good, is one's duty because being a fragment
of God, one's own desire is the desire of God Himself, and not
that of the world.

A man is independent in performing his own duty of God-
realization or Self-realization or salvation, because in this there
is no need of body, senses, mind and intellect etc., but only
the need to sever connection with them. In performing duty for
another, a man is dependent because that needs the body, senses,
"
439,"398 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA — [Chapter3 :
mind, intellect, things and persons etc. :

When a man practises spiritual discipline in order to realize
God, without accepting his affinity for the body, his practice is
his own duty. All the means followed, in order to attain Self-
realization or God-realization, are included in one's own duty =
(svadharma) while all the actions done for the world, are included
in the duty for another (paradharma). Thus, practising the three
Disciplines (Action, Knowledge and Devotion) is a man's own ;
duty, while hankering after worldly pleasures and prosperity,
having accepted affinity for the body, is the duty of another.

All the virtuous actions such as a pilgrimage, fast, penance,
meditation and trance etc., performed with physical, subtle and
causal bodies, with the expectation of reward 1.e., with a selfish
motive, turn to be 'paradharma’ (the duty of another). But if these

are performed for the welfare of others, without expecting any -
reward, these become, 'svadharma’ (one's own duty). The reason is,
that the self is desireless, while desire is born by having affinity
for nature (prakrti). So, when a man having desire, performs his 7
duty, it becomes the duty of another. One's own duty, leads to
salvation, while the duty of another leads to bondage. -

Every man having a disinclination for the duty of others,
should perform his own duty of God-realization or Self-realization,
for which this human body has been bestowed upon him. As far
as, the performance of duty of another is concerned it can be
performed in lower births as also heaven etc., where the only
aim is the enjoyment of pleasures. A man is independent and
capable of performing his own duty, while he is dependent and
incapable of performing the duty of another. He is sad when
he has a desire to acquire worldly objects, and depends on them
having acquired them. This dependence is 'paradharma’ (the duty
of another). But, when there is no desire, there is no question of
any want or dependence. That is 'svadharma' (one's own duty).

While performing one's own duty, a man may have to undergo
"
440,"Verse 35] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 399 -
a lot of suffering adversity, and even may lose his life, but it oe
will lead him to salvation (God-realization), while the duty of
another, even though full of merit and easy to perform, is fraught
with danger i.e., leads him to the cycle of birth and death.
All the pains, sorrows and worries eétc., of the world, are born -
by the performance of the duty of another, while the performance
of one's own duty leads him to the eternal bliss.
Appendix—<According to his birth and actions whatever a ”
striver assumes himself, his ‘dharma’ (duty) is ‘svadharma’ for
him and whatever is forbidden for him, that is ‘paradharma’ =
(duty of another) for him; as a striver assumes_himself to be
of a particular ‘Varna’ (order of life) and ‘Agrama’ (stage of
life), for him the duty of the man of that ‘Varna’ and ‘Aérama’
is ‘svadharma’. If he thinks himself to be a pupil or a teacher,
study or teaching is ‘svadharma’ for him. If he assumes -
himself to be a servant or inquisitive (Jijiiasu) or devotee, then service
or inquisitiveness or devotion is ‘svadharma’ for him. Evils such as
theft and violence etc., which involve ill and harm of others cannot
be ‘svadharma’ for anyone but that is “kudharma’ or ‘Adharma’.*
Performance of action in a disinterested way for the welfare of
others (viz., Karmayoga) is ‘svadharma’. In the Gita “svadharma’
(one’s own duty) has been mentioned ‘sahajakarma’, ‘svakarma’ |
and “svabhavajakarma’.
Performance of action against one’s duty is ‘akartavya’ and ,
‘not to discharge one’s duty’ is also ‘akartavya’ (neglecting of
duty) (Gita 2/33).
*In every dharma these three are there—‘kudharma’, ‘adharma’ and ‘para-
dharma’. The feeling to harm others and diplomacy etc., are ‘kudharmain dharma’.
To kill an animal in a sacrifice is “adharma in dharma’. The ‘dharma’ of the people
of other “Varna’ and ‘ASrama’ is ‘paradharma in dharma’. Kudharma, adharma
and paradharma—these three don’t lead a person to salvation. The dharma (duty)
which involves renunciation of selfishness & pride and welfare of others at present
and in future leads to salvation. | |

Link:—Why does a man not perform his own duty, when he
knows that one's own duty is better, even though devoid of merit
than the duty of another, well discharged? For this Arjuna, puts
a question, in the verse that follows— :

TAT SH

arjuna uvaca — _
atha kena prayukto'yam papam carati pirusah
anicchannapi varsneya baladiva _oniyojitah
Arjuna said:

But, why is a man impelled to commit sin, as if by force, even 7
against his will, O Varsneya (Krsna)? 36 ©
Comment:— | | -

""Atha kena prayukto'yam papam carati pirusah anicchannapi
varsneya baladiva niyojitah'—Lord Krsna has been addressed as
'Varsneya’, because he belonged to the Vrsni clan. In the preceding ;
verse, Lord Krsna praised the performance of one's duty, and
duty as performed, according to one's caste and clan. So Arjuna,
addresses the Lord as Varsneya. A sensible man does not want
to commit sin, by thinking of its bitter and sad fruit.

Here the term 'anicchan' does not mean, discarding desire for
pleasure and prosperity. It rather, stands for the renunciation of
desire, to commit sin. A sensible man does not want to commit
sin, but it is the desire for pleasure and prosperity, which deviates
him from the performance of his duty and forces him to perform
sinful acts.

The expression 'baladiva niyojitah' (as if driven by force) has
been used, to point out the fact that a sensible man, by knowing
the bitter fruit of a sinful act does not want to commit it, yet
"
442,"Verse 36] | SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 401
he is forcibly driven to it. From this, it appears that some force
is there, to compel him to commit sins.

The root of this sin 1s desire, for worldly pleasures ,
and prosperity. But a man does not give any heed to this :
desire, and so he is unable to know the root of evils (sins).

He understands that he wants to abstain from committing sins,
but some entity is forcibly engaging him, in sins. Duryodhana 7
also declares:— _ |

""I know what 1s righteousness, but I am not inclined to it; _
I also know what is unrighteousness, but [ cannot get rid of It.

There is some ‘deva' (force) in my heart, which drives me to
act"" (Garga-Samhita, ASvamedha. 50/36).

The term 'deva' used by Duryodhana stands for desire, (for
pleasure and prosperity) which forces him to commit sin, and ~
not to follow righteousness.

The expression 'Kena prayukto'yam papath carati'—also -
shows that he is impelled to commit sin by some other force.

The Lord, in the thirty-fourth verse, said, ""Attachment and -
aversion (which are subtle forms of desire and anger) are, the
foes of a striver (i.e., these are the roots of sins)"". As it was
said in a general way, Arjuna could not understand this point.

So he puts this question. Arjuna, means to ask whether it is

lack of faith or carping spirit or villainous nature or clouded
understanding or force of one's own nature or attachment and
aversion, or disinclination for one's own duty and inclination to |
the duty of another (described from the thirty-first verse to the
thirty-fifth verse), which drives a man to commit sin. Besides

these, is it God or fortune or time or circumstance or action or

bad company or society or custom or any government law etc.,

which is impelling him to commit sin? |

The Blessed Lord said:

It is desire and it is anger, born of the mode of passion —
(rajas), most greedy and most sinful. Know this to be the enemy
concerned, 37 |
Comment:— |

""Rajogunasamudbhavah'—The Lord, in the seventh verse of
the fourteenth chapter, declares, ""The mode of passion springs ~
from desire and attachment"", while here, He declares that desire
is born of a mode of passion. It means, that desire is born of -
the mode of passion, while desire enhances passion (attachment).

A person believes that worldly objects provide him pleasure,

so he has a desire to acquire them in order to enjoy pleasure. 7
This desire, gives birth to attachment. So long as this process
continues, he cannot get rid of sinful acts. ,

'Kama* esa krodha esa'—A man, has a desire for sensual /
pleasure and prosperity. Sometimes, sins are committed under
the sway of desire, while other times, these are committed,
under the sway of anger. Through desire and anger, different :
types of sins are committed. Therefore, these two terms have
been used. This desire is the root of all sint. When it is not

*'T should get this, I should get this——this is desire. Such a desire is known
as ‘Kama’. |

TThough disinclination for God and not attaching importance to
discrimination are also the cause of sins, yet here desire has been said to be the
root of sins because here in this chapter of the Discipline of Action, the aim of a
striver is to get rid of desire.
"
444,"Verse 37] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 403 :
satisfied, it gives birth to anger. The singular number, has been
used for desire and anger in order to explain that only desire
is the root of sins.
When a desire is satisfied, it gives birth to greed; but if
it is not satisfied, it gives birth to anger. If the person, who |
is a stumbling block to the satisfaction of our desire, is more
powerful than we, fear is born instead of anger. Therefore, in
the Gita, besides desire and wrath, fear has also been mentioned -
as ‘delivered from desire, fear and anger’ (4/10) and ‘free from
desire, fear and anger’ (5/28). _
Whatever we may desire, does not happen, and whatever we
do not desire, happens—this is suffering. Desire is the root of all
sins and sufferings. A man with a desire cannot get happiness, ~
even in a dream (Manasa 7/90/1). If desire is renounced, there
is no question of any suffering. | -
Craving for perishable objects, is called desire, while the
need for God-realization, which may appear to be like desire,
is not really desire. The reason is, that desire is never satisfied, a
but it is strengthened by sense enjoyments, while the need of
God-realization, is fulfilled having realized God. A man has
desire for something, which is different from him (the self),
while God is one with the self. Similarly, the need of rendering
selfless service (the Discipline of Action), Self-realization (the
Discipline of Knowledge) and devotion to God (the Discipline |
of Devotion) are not desires. In fact, the need of the self (soul)
is to realize God but he (the self) has a desire to acquire the
perishable objects etc., because his discrimination is veiled.
A doubt may arise here as to how the worldly affairs will
go on, without desire. The clarification is, that worldly affairs
relate with actions and commodities; rather than with desires.
Actions are performed outwardly and so their fruit in the form
"
445,"404 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3 -
of objects and circumstances etc., is also external, while desire
is internal.

Nothing in the world, can be acquired by having desire. It
is the fruit of effort. People have a desire to become rich, yet |
they remain poor. All the people, except the liberated souls, -
have a desire to remain alive, but they die. A man's actions
bear fruits, according to his fate or fortune, not because of his
desire. Whatever, is allotted cannot be blotted, whether you have -
desire for it or not. As, a man has to undergo unfavourable
circumstances unwillingly, he would also face favourable _

- circumstances. A man may bear pain, blame and dishonour etc.,
without any desire. Similarly, he may gain pleasure, praise and
honour, without desire as a result of his fate.

A man may have a desire for immediate pleasures and
prosperity, or for future fruits, for his actions. But a desire is ~
the root of pain, here as well as hereafter, so a man should

_- renounce, desire. -

It is out of desire that a man performs actions. When there

is an excess of this desire, it forces him to perform forbidden
actions. It is because of desire that he is more attached, to the -
unreal. As soon as, he renounces desire, his affinity for the
unreal is renounced.

When desire is satisfied, we attain the same. state in
which we were, before desire was aroused. When desire, say
of receiving a hundred rupees, was not aroused in a striver's
mind, he was desireless, and again after having received that
amount, he becomes desireless. It is because of his attachment
to the worldly pleasures, that new desires are born. Thus, desire
are never satisfied.

Some people beliéve that desires cannot be totally renounced.

But the fact is, that desires cannot be maintained. These appear
and disappear, have a beginning and an end, and constantly
decay. If we do not have new desire, the old desire, whether |
"
446,"Verse 37] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 405 .
satisfied or not, disappears itself.
Everyone's desires, may not be satisfied forever but these can
be renounced forever, because these are transitory. The difficulty
in renouncing desire is, that we have a feeling of ‘mine’. If we
become free from this feeling of ‘mine’, we shall become, desireless. :
Desirelessness will lead to detachment. When we become free
from the feeling of ‘mine’, desire and attachment, we attain
uniformity, desirelessness and independence automatically. -
We must pay attention to this vital fact. We think that it is
difficult to renounce desires. But is it easy to satisfy these? It -
is impossible to satisfy all the desires. Even king DaSaratha, the
father of Lord Rama, could not satisfy his desire, of not sending
his son into exile. Thus, if satisfaction of desires is impossible,
and renunciation is difficult. Which one is easier—satisfaction or
renunciation? The answer 1s clear, that desires can be renounced 7
rather than satisfied. But we commit an error when we try to
satisfy desires, but we do not make efforts to renounce them.
Therefore, a striver should renounce desires.
Desires are of four kinds:— -
1. Desires which satisfy necessities of life.*
2. Desire which is personal and just, but is beyond our
power. Such a desire should be rooted out, by offering it to GodT.
* There are four criteria for such a desire—
(i) It is born at present (as desire for food when one is hungry).
(ii) The material to satisfy it is available at present. -
(iii) It is impossible to live without satisfying it.
(iv) It's satisfaction does evil neither to him nor to others.
Thus the necessity should be satisfied. When the necessities are satisfied, a
man gets strength to renounce desires. But he should not derive pleasure out of
the satisfaction of even necessities otherwise it will be conducive to the birth of
new desires which can never be satisfied.
t'There should not be injustice and exploitation in the world.’ A striver
having offered such a desire to God, becomes carefree. The Lord satisfies it if
He thinks it proper.
"
447,"-— 406 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 -

3. Satisfy the just desire of others for their welfare and
within our power to satisfy. Thus by satisfying the desires of

| others, we get strength to renounce our own.

4. Other desires, besides, the above-mentioned ones, which ~
can be rooted out, by reflection. -

_ ""MahaSano mahapapma'—Desire is such an enemy, that is
not satiated by, sense-enjoyments. Tulasidasa in Vinaya Patrika
declares, “This fire of desire is never extinguished by the churned- ~
butter of sense-enjoyments"" (198). |

As desire for prosperity, is never satisfied, similarly, the desire -
for sense-enjoyments, is never satisfied, but rather strengthened.
So, it has been called, all devouring, and most sinful, because
it is the root of all sinful actions, such as theft, robbery. and
violence etc. : ,

As soon as, desire is born, it induces man to have a
disinclination for his duty, for the self and for God, and an
inclination towards perishable world. Consequently, he commits -
sins, which lead to hell and birth, in lower bodies. |

It is, because of the desire for sense-enjoyments, that the _
changing and perishable world, (body etc.,) seems real and one
seeks pleasure out of it. At the time of enjoyment, he forgets the
kaleidoscopic nature of objects and regards these and himself, as
permanent. If he realized this fact, he, instead of getting entangled
in the mirage of pleasures, will have his eye directed to God and
the Self, Who are real. It shows, that a man enjoys the worldly
sense-enjoyments, by having a disinclination for the real, God _
or Self; and by enjoying the sense-enjoyments, he develops a
disinclination for God. .

Such a depraved one can't avoid violence, for himself as
well as, for others. When a rich man leads a luxurious life and
enjoys worldly pleasures, the poor are sad, to see him, suffer.
Moreover, he (the self) being a fragment of God is sentient, but
when one attaches importance to riches or luxuries, the insentient,
"
448,"Verse 37] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 407 -
he becomes a slave to these and has a downfall. Ail the worldly

materials are limited, so these should be shared by all the people.

He, who enjoys the share of others, 1s a sinner. So a man, should

have only the bare necessities of life. In the scriptures, it is :
mentioned that even bare necessities of life should be satisfied, :
only after offering these to parents, preceptors, children,women

and old people etc.

A gratifier destroys worldly material, does violence to those who -
suffer shortage, and leads himself to a downfall, while a wise man
(liberated soul) does not do so, because all actions, are performed ~
by him, according to scriptural injunctions for the maintenance
of a body, without expecting any fruit (Gita 4/21; 18/17). All the
possessions, including the body of such a wise man, are utilized
automatically, for the welfare of all beings. 7

The need to maintain the body, is neither all-devouring nor |
most sinful, and it is satisfied, as hunger, after having a meal.

But a desire is never fully satisfied, the more we satisfy it, the -
more intense it becomes.

""Viddhyenamiha vairinam'—lIn fact, a man attains peace, having -
renounced the desire for worldly objects. Yet out of ignorance
he believes that he has attained peace by acquiring the worldly
objects (i.e., by satisfying the desire). Thus, by considering desire 7
to be a source of enjoyment, he regards it as a friend and well-
wisher. So, the desire never perishes. Therefore, the Lord urges
us to know the desire, to be an enemy, because it, having blurred
our discrimination, leads us to sins.

Desire, is the root of all sins, sufferings and hell, here as
well as hereafter. It results in no benefit.

An important and easy means, to get rid of desire, is to

render service to others with the body, senses, mind, intellect
and life-breath etc., without any selfish motive. |
"
449,"408 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA -— [Chapter3
In the, Discipline of Action, actions performed with the
physical body, thinking with the subtle body and trance with
the causal body, are done only for the world, not for one's own
self, because the gross body, the subtle body and the causal body _
have their identity respectively, with the gross, subtle and causal
world. By doing so, one should not derive any pleasure out of
them.* It makes him free from attachment, to the fruit of action
and thus he easily becomes free from attachment to action. 7
'T should be obeyed’, ‘this thing may serve my purpose’,
‘Whatever, I say should be honoured'—these are all desires. A ~
desire is very disastrous. When a man satisfies the just desires
of others, according to his resources, it enables him to renounce
his own desires. If we cannot fulfil the desires of others, at Jeast
we should have the sentiment to do so. .
Egoism, attachment and desire, bind a man to the world,

- through separation, defect and disquietude, respectively.
Renunciation of desire, leads to detachment, while detachment -
leads to non-egoism. A striver, following the Discipline of
Action, does not regard the body, senses, mind, intellect, egoism _
and objects etc., as his or for him, but he regards these as the
world's and for the world, by realizing the reality about them.

_ When a striver resolves, not to give pain to others, he starts
rendering service to them. If by chance, anyone suffers because
of his action, he very humbly tenders a sincere apology. Even if
the sufferer does not forgive him, he is automatically forgiven _
by God. While rendering service to others, a striver should never
expect any reward in return. By doing so this enemy (desire) is
easily overcome. |

Appendix—The desire to derive pleasure from a thing, a

* The desire to derive pleasure out of either service or the thought of the
welfare of others or trance and to maintain them, is an obstacle to God-
realization (Gital4/6). Therefore, a striver should be detached from the three
modes—of goodness, of passion and of ignorance because the self is free
from all attachment. ,
"
450,"Verse 38] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 409 .
person or an action is named ‘kama’. This evil in the form of )
‘Kama’ involves endless flaws, endless defects and endless sins.
Therefore so long as a man has desire, he can’t be totally free
from flaws, defects and sins. The desire to get pleasure causes
evils. He who has no desire becomes free from evils.
The fruit of action is of three kinds—pleasant, unpleasant
and mixed (Gita 18/12). Out of the three the fruit of desire that
accrues is only unpleasant. _
Prarabdha does not compel a man to resort to sinful acts but
it is the desire that directs a man to sinful acts. An urge for an -
activity may be there for enjoyment of fruits of past actions due _
to Prarabdha but there cannot be any sinful act as there 1s no
need to commit such a sin for enjoyment of fruits of destiny.
Kama (desire) is born of ‘Rajoguna’ (the mode of passion).
Therefore the cause of sins is ‘Rajoguna’ and their effect (evolute) -
is “Tamoguna’ (the mode of ignorance). All sins are born of
“Rajoguna’. ,

embryo by placenta, so is this (knowledge) concealed by desire. 38
Comment:—
""‘Dhimenavriyate vahnih'— As fire is covered by smoke, so
is this knowledge, (discrimination) covered by desire.
Discrimination is revealed in the intellect. There are three
"
451,"410 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 |
divisions of intellect—of the nature of 'goodness' (Sattvika),
of ‘passion’ (Rajas) and of ‘ignorance’ (Tamas). The intellect
by which one knows, what ought to be done and what
ought not to be done, is of the nature of ‘goodness’. The |
intellect, by which one wrongly understands, what ought to .
be done and what ought not to be done, is of the nature of
‘passion’, while the intellect by which one sees all things in
a perverted way (contrary to the truth) is, of the nature of |
‘ignorance’ (Gita 18/30—32). When desire is born, even the
intellect of goodness (Sattvika) is covered by desire, as fire
by smoke, then the intellect of the mode of passion (Rajas) ©
and ignorance (tamas) will definitely be covered by it, of
which there is no doubt.

As soon as, a desire is born, one’s Spiritual path is covered
with its smoke. If it is given scope for enhancement, it makes -
the path totally dark. By thinking that the desired objects are
deserting us constantly, we can destroy desires.

We have desire to acquire the worldly objects, because |
these appear to be beautiful and charming. The desire veils
our discrimination, which is a privilege of human birth. Just ~
as, fire can burn even when it is covered with smoke, so can
discrimination work, if a man becomes cautious, as soon as desire
is born. A man can get rid of desire at the outset, by thinking —
of the kaleidoscopic and transitory nature, of the worldly objects
etc., which he wants to acquire.

""Yathadarso malena ca'—When dirt accumulates on the surface —
of a mirror, it cannot reflect an object. Similarly, the dirt of desire,
covers knowledge (discrimination), and a striver cannot decide
what he ought to do and what he ought not to do. Because of
desire, he hankers after worldly pleasures and prosperity, and he
has a downfall. This is the second stage of desire. | |

| A striver, should realize that it is not a thing, but its proper
use, which is significant. So, instead of having a desire to acquire
"
452,"Verse 38] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 411 -
more and more, he should think to make a proper use of it.
Moreover, he cannot acquire objects merely by desire. _

The less importance, he will attach to the worldly objects, the
more importance he will attach to God. When he stops attaching | |
importance to the worldly objects altogether, he will realize God .
and desire will totally be eliminated. |

'Yatholbenavrto garbhah'—When, dirt accumulates on the
surface of a murror, even though it does not reflect a face, yet - ;
it can be known that it is a mirror. But when an embryo is
covered by the placenta, it cannot be known, whether the child -
is male or female. Similarly, knowledge (discrimination) is, so
much veiled at this third stage, that he totally forgets his duty
and his desire is intensified.

If desire is not satisfied, it gives birth to anger. From --
anger arises delusion; from delusion there is destruction of ,
discrimination; from destruction of descrimination one does
not do, what ought to be done, but indulges in evil acts, -
such as falsehood, fraud, dishonesty, injustice, oppression and |
other sinful acts. The Lord does not want to call such people, ""
human beings (men). Therefore, the Lord while descnbing
such people, in the sixteenth chapter (from the eighth to the
eighteenth verses), has not used any such word which stands
for human beings. The Lord has called the people, who have
heaven as their goal, 'Kamatmanah' (desire incarnate) (Gita
2/43), because they are the embodiments of desires. Having
identified themselves with desires, they hold that there is no
higher aim than the gratification of desires (Gita 16/11).

[When desires are strengthened, a man totally forgets, that
the real aim of human life is God-realization. But if due to past
influences or good company, or any other factor, he comes to |
know the real aim of human life, he can attain salvation or
God-realization. ]
"
453,"412 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 _

'Tatha tenedamavrtam'—In this verse, the Lord has given |
three illustrations, pertaining to the covering of discrimination
by desire. It means that discrimination is covered by desire,
in three stages. But those who hold that desire is the cause of _
happiness, and so depend on it, cannot renounce it (desire), while .
strivers who practise spiritual discipline, know it in its reality —
and can root it out.

The Lord here, has described the three stages of desire, _
so that a striver may kill the enemy, in the form of desire,
as directed by Him, in the forty-first and forty-third verses _
of this chapter. In fact, desire crosses the first two stages so
quickly, that a man cannot perceive these phases. Then desire
leads him, to all sorts of sins and sufferings. Therefore, a
striver, through discrimination, should not allow a desire to
arise. But if it is born, it should be renounced either in the -
first or the second stage, it should not be allowed to reach
the third stage.

As smoke, shows the presence of fire, and as a mirror and an ~
embryo are identified even when these are covered respectively,
with dust and placenta, so discrimination is possessed by every
human being, even when it is covered by desire. But due to the ©
force of desire, discrimination is not used. .

According to the scriptures 'Mala' (sin) (Impurity), ""Viksepa’
(distraction) and ‘avarana' (veil), are said to be, the three
stumbling blocks to God-realization. These defects, are born
of the affinity of man, for the unreal world. This affinity
for the world is, created because of desire. Thus the root
of all the evils, is desire. When desire is renounced, affinity
for the unreal world, is renounced. When affinity for the
unreal, is renounced, all the evils perish and discrimimation
is revealed. |
"
454,"Verse 38] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 413
So long as, the worldly objects seem real, beautiful and :

charming, a man attaches importance to them. This attachment,

is the main obstacle to God-realization, as it 1s conducive to

the three defects—sin, confusion and veil. Out of these three,

sin is regarded as the most deadly defect. Desire is the root -

of sin. When a striver resolves not to commit sin in future,

the defects are rooted out and his sin, begins to decay. But

when he renounces the desire, totally, all his sins perish. -
In the Srimadbhagavata, Lord Krsna has pointed out

that a man with desire can attain salvation, by following the -

Discipline of Action (Performance of action) without expecting —

fruit—'Karmayogastu kiminam' (11/20/7). So a person who

is not free from desire, need not lose heart, because only

he who has a desire, will get rid of it. Desires can be -

renounced easily, through the Discipline of Action. When a

striver performs any act, whether it is mundane or spiritual, he

should think, ""Why do I perform it and how do I perform -

it?"" By thinking so, he will constantly have an eye on the

atm of his life. Consequently, he will perform only virtuous

actions, being free from attachment and the desire for fruit.

This performance of actions without attachment, and desire

for reward, will lead him to salvation.
Appendix—Desire is the main obstacle to God-realization. As

there is a jar full of water, in it we have to do two actions—the

first is to empty the jar and the second 1s to fill it with ether. |

But in fact two actions are not to be performed but only one

is to be performed—to empty the jar. Empty the jar and the

ether will be filled itself. Similarly renunciation of desire and

God-realization—these two are not be done. Renounce the desire

and God will be automatically realized. It is because of desire

that God seems to be unrealized.

Comment:—
. 'Etena'—This term has been used for desire, which has been -
declared by the Lord as most sinful, in the thirty-seventh verse
of this chapter. |
'Duspirenanalena ca'— As fire is never satiated, when clarified
butter is added to it, it rather rages stronger, so is desire never -
satisfied, by enjoying the objects of desire, it is rather strengthened
(Srimadbhagavata 9/19/14; Manusmrti 2/94). The fire of desire,
devours everything which comes into its contact. ;
Sundaradasa, has also expressed the same idea, when he
says, ""The richer a man grows, the more he hankers after worldly 7
prosperity. A poor man, may desire to gain only a few rupees,
but when he gains them, he has desire for a hundred and then a
thousand, and after that a million and then a billion and trillion |
and then the ownership of the entire universe. Yet, this form
of desire, will not be satiated. It is only, by contentment, that
this desire can be subdued. | |
A poor man, is not so greedy, as is a rich man. When a man
earns a hundred rupees, he desires to earn a thousand rupees. It -
means that he feels that he needs nine hundred more. When he
earns a thousand rupees, he desires to have, ten thousand rupees.
It means that he needs nine thousand more. When he gains ten
thousand rupees he has desire to gain a lac of rupees. And he
needs ninety thousand more. Thus the richer he grows, the more
"
456,"Verse 39] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 415 .
greedy he becomes. On the other hand, a contented man, being
free from all desires, is the king of kings.

In fact it is not wealth, but desire for wealth, which is an
obstacle to God-realization.This desire, deprives the rich and the ;
poor equally, of God-realization, as it can never be satiated. A
man can only get rid of it by renouncing it.

'Kamaripena'—The desire to derive pleasure, out of the /
affinity for the insentient is called ‘Kama’. This desire manifests
itself in different forms, such as lust (for gold, power and
of the flesh), craving (for things), attachment (to loving and -
charming objects), hope (to acquire something) and greed (to
acquire more and more). When a man's desire is intensified,
it is followed by solicitation. These are, the different forms
of desire. _

‘Jnanino nityavairina'—Here, the term ‘Jnaninah’ stands for
the wise striver, who remains engaged in practising the spiritual -
discipline, because it is he, who recognizes this enemy in the form
of desire, and slays it. The worldly people consider it as pleasant.

The Lord declares, that desire is the constant enemy of a ;
wise striver. As, soon as desire is born, a thought comes to
his mind, that it will lead him to suffering. Desires involve |
dependence on the world and create importance of the world,
which are stumbling blocks to the spiritual path. It pricks him
at the outset, that it will result in adversity. ,

The ignorant, who are engrossed in sensual pleasures, hold

that desire is their friend, because they derive pleasure out of ""
the objects. Without desire objects cannot provide pleasure.
But the fact is, that desire and the pleasures, lead him to
sorrow, suffering, imprisonment and hell etc. Thus, desire is |
a constant enemy of the ignorant also, but they are not aware
of it, while wise strivers are aware of it.

‘Avrtarn jiianam'—Every being is, endowed with
"
457,"416 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3 |
discrimination. In the case of man it can develop, but in birds,
beasts and other births, it is confined to the maintenance of the
body. In the case of men also, it is veiled by desire, which does
not let them follow the spiritual (sentient) path of God-realization,
but keeps them engaged in mundane pleasures.
Everyone, likes loving and true words, and hates harsh
and false words. It means that every person has the knowledge -
(discrimination) of good and bad, virtue and vice, right and
wrong. In spite of this knowledge, an ignorant person uses harsh
language, tells a lie and does not perform his duty scrupulously, -
because his discrimination is concealed by desire.
A man thinks that he derives joy out of sense-objects, but
in fact, he gets joy by renouncing them. Everyone knows that
during wakefulness and sleep a man feels happy and sad, because ~
of his affinity, for the sense-objects. But during sound sleep he
does not remember, sense-objects at all. So, when he awakes he ;
says that he had a very peaceful and sound sleep. Moreover, he
gets tired during wakefulness, while he is refreshed after sound
sleep. It means, that it is renunciation of the sense-objects, -
which provides joy or peace.
When a man desires money, his mind is attached to it. But
when it is acquired, the mind renounces this attachment and so
he feels happy. Had the money provided him joy, he would have
never felt sad, so long as he had money. But he feels sad, even
after possessing that money. |
When a man desires anything,’ he becomes dependant on
it. Suppose, a man has a desire to buy a watch he feels sad,
without it; this is dependence upon it. He thinks that if he
acquires money, he can buy a watch i.e., he feels independent
if he has money, and dependent without money. But this is
a wrong notion. If he acquires money and buys a watch he,
instead of having dependence on the watch, has dependence
"
458,"Verse 39] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI | 417
on money, because money is also different from, the self.

When a man's discrimination is hid by desire, he realizes his
dependence on objects, but he does not realize his dependence,

on money. He thinks that he has become independent, because .
of money. It is very difficult to renounce such a dependence,

which disguises itself as independence.

The world is transitory. All the worldly objects such as _
the body, wealth, property etc., are decaying every moment,
and are separating from us. But while enjoying these, we _
forget that they are temporary, we regard them as eternal and
permanent. Not to talk of the common people, even a striver
gets entangled in pleasures by considering ‘these as eternal
and permanent. It so happens, because his discrimination is
enveloped by desire. -

The Lord declares, that desire is the constant enemy of the
wise, so that a man may save himself from it and may attain -
bliss, desire being the root of all sins and suffermgs. Once,

a man was looking for his wife. People asked him, ""What is

the name of your wife?"" He replied, ""Disgrace."" They again |
asked ""What is your name?"" He replied, ""Wicked."" People

said, ""Don't be agitated, she is a very chaste and faithful wife,

she will come to you, because disgrace ever accompanies the |
wicked."" Similarly suffering automatically accompany the man,

who hankers after perishable pleasures.

A man wants to avoid suffering, but he does not
renounce desire, which is the root cause of suffering. In the
Ramacaritamanasa it is declared, ""A man can't attain bliss, even
in a dream, so long as he does not renounce desire"" (7/90/1). The
Lord, by the terms 'analena' and 'duspurena’, wants to explain
that desire for enjoyment of worldly objects, is never satiated.
"
459,"418 . SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 |
The more he enjoys them, the more, the desire for these is
strengthened. In order to satiate it, he is inclined to sinful acts.

When he has desire for wealth, he wants to earn it, by fair means

or foul. Then, at the second stage the desire engages him in theft :
and robberies, while in the third stage it leads him to commit
violence and even murder. Thus the desire for pleasure, makes

life miserable, here as well as hereafter. .

Appendix—-The main obstacle to the practice of spiritual
discipline is the desire for pleasure which is born by the
contact of senses with sense-objects. This obstacle lingers for -
a long time. Wherever a striver indulges in pleasure, there his
spiritual progress is arrested. As much as even the pleasure
(joy) from trance, hinders his progress.* Even the desire of
‘Sattvika’ happiness and attachment to it arrest his spiritual _
progress—‘sukhasangena badhnati’ (Gita 14/6)T. Therefore the
Lord has declared that desire is the constant enemy of a wise
(discriminating) striver—‘na tesu ramate budhah’ (Gita 5/22) and -
‘duhkhameva sarvarh vivekinah’ (Yogadarsana 2/15).

The senses, the mind and the intellect are said to be its
abode. Veiling of wisdom by the senses, mind and intellect

Comment:— -
'Indriyani mano buddhirasyadhisthanamucyate'—Desire, is |
said to have five abodes—({1) objects (Gita 3/34), (2) senses,
(3) mind, (4) intellect and (5) assumed ego (T’) viz., doer
(Gita 2/59). Though it seems to reside in five abodes, yet in fact, :
it resides in the ‘assumed ego’. As it seems to abide in these five
places, these are called its seats. : ~
All actions are performed, with the body, senses, mind and
intellect. If desire resides in these, it hinders the performance :
of spiritual actions. Therefore, a Karmayogi (man of action),
having abandoned attachment and the fruit of actions, performs -
actions, only by the body, senses, mind and intellect, for the
purification of the self (Gita 5/11). ,
In fact, desire resides in the assumed ego (i.e., identification :
of the self with the body etc.). This ego or ‘I'ness, is merely
assumed that, 'I belong to a particular caste, creed or order -
of life""—this is a mere assumption. Sins perish, after bearing
fruits, but desire which resides in the assumed ego, gives |
birth to new sins. Therefore, it is desire which binds the |
embodied soul.
In the Mahabharata, it is mentioned, ""In the world it is only
desire which binds a man. He who is liberated from the bondage |
of desire, becomes eligible to attain the Eternal (Absolute)""
(Santiparva 251/7).
'Etairvimohayatyesa jiianamavrtya dehinam'—It is because of
desire, that a man does what he ought not do, and does not
do what he ought to do. Thus the embodied soul is deluded,
by desire.
In the second chapter, the Lord declared—From desire
"
461,"420 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 =
springs anger’ (2/62) and ‘From anger arises delusion’ (2/63).
It means, that if anyone becomes an obstacle to the satisfaction
of a desire, anger arises. But if the desire is satisfied, it gives
birth to greed, and from greed arises deluston. Desire is, an :
evolute of the mode of passion, while delusion, is an evolute |
of the mode of ignorance.The mode of passion and the mode
of ignorance, are not far from each other.* Desire, deludes the
embodied soul, through senses, mind and intellect. The desire, -
which is an evolute of the mode of passion, is transformed
into delusion, which is an evolute of ignorance. _
A man has a desire to enjoy sense-objects (sensual pleasures).
Firstly, he does not get those desired sense-objects. However,
if he gets them, they do not stay. In spite of it, he desires
to get them somehow or the other, and thinks of so many
devices to obtain them. Therefore, first desire attracts the senses, -
towards objects. Then the senses, attract the mind, while the
senses and the mind attract, the intellect. Thus desire, veiling
wisdom, through the senses, mind and intellect, deludes the
embodied soul and drives it to ruin. -
It is a rule that if a master terminates the service of a
sincere servant, he is not likely to get such a sincere servant
again. Similarly, if a servant does not carry out the order of |
a virtuous master and does not serve him, he will not get an
opportunity to work under such good masters. In the same
way, if a person by misusing the human body, instead of .
realizing God, wastes it in hankering after worldly pleasures,
and prosperity, he will not get this human life again. It is,
because of the impurity of mind, that a man rejects good
things; and the mind is tainted by, desire. Therefore, first of
all, a striver should renounce desire.
* Among the modes of ignorance, passion and goodness the ratio of the
distance is 1:10:100. It means that modes of ignorance and passion are near each
other, while the mode of goodness is far-away from them.
"
462,"Verse 41] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 421
'Dehinam vimohayati'—It means that, desire deludes only
the embodied soul i.e., the soul which has identified itself with
the body, and has accepted the relationship of 'mine' with it. |
The Lord, at the beginning of His gospel, explained that the :
soul is different from the body (Gita 2/11—30). This is also
everyone's experience. The desire covering wisdom, deludes
the embodied soul (the soul which accepts its affinity for the _
body), but not the pure soul. A man (the soul) assuming the
body as ‘I ', ‘mine’ and for 'me', attaches importance to the -
perishable objects and gets attached to them, which, creates
affinity for them. This affinity gives birth to desire. Desire,
having deluded the man (embodied soul), leads him to
worldly bondage.
IOI -
Link:—The Lord, in the next verse, tells Arjuna the device
of eliminating this enemy te., desire, and directs him to -
kill it.

Therefore, O best of Bharatas (Arjuna), first control the senses
then, kill, this sinful destroyer, of wisdom and realization. 41
Comment:— |
‘Tasmattvamindriyanyadau niyamya bharatarsabha'— Senses,
are said to be controlled, when they do not enjoy the sense-
objects, but are used in order to maintain the body or to attain
a spiritual goal. It means, that they should neither have an
aversion to disagreeable action, nor an attachment for agreeable
action (Gita 18/10). Actions performed with attachment and |
aversion, strengthen attachment and aversion and these drive
"
463,"422 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 |
a man to ruin.. Therefore, let the scriptures be the authority

for determining what should be done and what should not

be done (Gita 16/24).Thus, by following scriptural injunction,
pertaining to the performance of prescribed actions, and non- |
performance of forbidden actions. senses are controlled.

So long as, a man is swayed by his senses, he cannot
have an eye on the goal of life. Without having an eye on the 7
goal of life i.e., without attaining it, desire cannot be totally
killed. So, first the Lord urges to control the senses, in order to -
kill desire. |

First, the senses get entangled in their objects, by which
desire for those objects is born. When a man performs actions
with desire, he comes under the full sway of senses and has
a downfall. But, he who performs his duty, by controlling the ~
senses, without expecting any fruit, quickly attains salvation.

'Enam jianavijnananasanam'—The term ‘Jnana’ also stands
for the knowledge of the scriptures (Gita 18/42). But in this |
context the term, stands for discrimination (what should be done -
and what should not be done). The term, 'vijnana’ stands for
Self-realization. |

Discrimination and Self-realization—both are axiomatic.

All the people have not realized the self, but discrimination

has been bestowed upon them. The term 'Anicchannapi', used

by Arjuna, in the thirty-sixth verse of this chapter, also proves |
that every human being possesses this faculty of discrimination.

It is by discrimination that he knows, what is virtue and what

is vice (sin). So, it is by discrimination that he does not want

to commit a sin. But, when discrimination is veiled by desire,

he commits sin without thinking of the consequences. When
discrimination is aroused, he performs actions, having thought
of the consequences.

Thus, desire veils discrimination, as well as Self-realization
"
464,"Verse 41] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 423 .
1.e., it does not let these reveal themselves. So it has been
called, the sinful destroyer. In fact it does not destroy them,
but it hides them. This 'Veiling' has been called destroying, ;
here Discrimination and Self-realization, are never destroyed,
while desire is destroyed. If clouds appear before the eyes, |
it is said that the sun has been covered by clouds. But in
fact, the sun is not covered, it is the eyes which are covered. -
Similarly, when it is said that desire has veiled discrimination
and Self-realization, it means that these are not veiled, but it
is the intellect which is concealed. -

'‘Papmanam hi prajahi'—Destre, is the root of all sins. Having
veiled discrimination, it makes a man blind. So he cannot recognize
the distinction between virtues and sins, and thus indulges in
sins, which lead him to ruin. So the Lord orders to slay desire -
by declaring it sinful.

A man wants to lead a lonely life of an ascetic, by _
renouncing household affairs but he does not renounce desire; he :
does not even think of renouncing it. If desires are renounced,
everything will be set right automatically. When a man dies ;
with unfulfilled desires, these lead him to the next birth. It
means, that desires lead him to the bondage of birth and
death. Thus, desires do nothing, except binding him.

When a man is attracted towards worldly objects, desire is
born. This desire veils discrimination and he indulges in sense-
pleasure. The pleasure of birds and beasts, is confined to the joy
born of the contact of senses, with objects. But, a man desires
objects and money and indulges in hoarding money. In order to
hoard money, he adopts foul means such as falsehood, fraud, thefts
and robberies etc. Moreover, he becomes proud of himself. This
pride is a demoniac trait. Thus, he is totally damned, Therefore
the Lord orders Arjuna, to slay sinful desire.

It is said that the senses are superior to the gross body,

Comment:— |
‘Indriyani paranyahuh'—Senses are superior to body or -
objects of senses. It means, that senses know the objects
but objects do not know senses. Senses live without objects,
but without senses, the existence of objects is not proved.
Objects cannot illumine senses, but senses illumine objects.
Senses remain the same while objects go on changing objects
come within the range of senses, while senses do not come
within the range of objects. Eyes (senses) can perceive the
physical body and objects, but the body and objects cannot
perceive the senses. So senses are greater, more powerful,
more subtle and have a wider range of activity, than objects
and the physical body.
‘Indriyebhyah pararn manah'— Senses, do not know the
mind, while the mind knows all the senses. Every sense,
knows only its own objects, but does not know the objects
"
466,"Verse 42-43] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 425 |
of other senses. Ears can perceive only sound, but cannot
perceive touch, form, taste and smell. Similarly, tongue can

only taste, nose can only smell, eyes can only see, and skin |
can only touch. But the mind knows the five senses, and
their objects. Therefore, the mind is superior, more powerful, |
more subtle, has a wider range of activity, than senses and ~

is, their illuminator. | ;

‘Manasastu para buddhih'—The mind, does not know the
intellect, but the intellect knows the mind and senses. The -
intellect, knows whether the mind is quiet or turbulent and whether
senses function properly or not. It means, that the intellect
knows the mind and its thoughts, as well as the senses and
their objects. Therefore, the intellect is greater, more powerful,
more subtle and has a wider range of activity, than the mind -
and is its illuminator.

""Yah buddheh paratastu sah'—The master of intellect is _
ego; therefore, a person says 'My intellect’. Intellect is an
instrument and ‘ego’ is the doer. The instrument depends,
on the doer. Desire, resides in the insentient portion of ego. :
But, it is because of the identification of the self with the
insentient body etc., that desire seems to reside, in the pure |
self (the sentient).

In fact, desire resides in ‘ego’ ‘I’, because ego has the
desire to enjoy pleasures and so becomes the enjoyer. The
enjoyer, enjoyment and the object to be enjoyed, belong to
the same _ class, otherwise the enjoyer cannot be attracted
towards the objects. But, there is no desire in the self, which
is the illuminator of the enjoyer, enjoyment and the object to
be enjoyed. All the insentient objects, such as the body, the
mind, the senses, the intellect and the ego are fragments of
nature (prakrti). Beyond ego there is the self, a fragment of
God. The self, is the base, the root, the cause, the inspirer
"
467,"426 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA (Chapter 3
of the body, senses, mind, intellect and ego, and is subtler,
greater, stronger, wider than all of them, and is also their
illuminator. |
There is pleasure or pain in the insentient nature (prakrti) of ,
the embodied soul, while the sentient (soul) does not undergo .
any modifications, such as pleasure or pain etc. The self (soul)
is the knower of any modification. But, when It identifies _
Itself with the insentient (body etc.,) it has to undergo pleasure
and pain. The sentient, (soul) by identifying Itself with the
insentient (body etc.,) becomes the enjoyer. In the inert only, -
there is no enjoyership. The enjoyership, remains in the ego
(where there is identification of the soul with the body). The
term ‘asya’, used in the fifty-ninth verse of the second chapter,
denotes the enjoyer, while the term ‘Parama’ denotes, God, ~
unattached Universal Soul. ""When a striver realizes, ‘Parama’
(God or Self) his taste or relish, also turns away (Gita 2/59).
A man, has desire in order to derive pleasure or joy, while the -
self is, naturally, a heap of joy. Therefore, on God-realization
or Self-realization, desire (desire for sensual pleasure) totally ~
perishes, forever.
The physical (gross) body, is the object of senses,
senses are the external instruments, while mind and intellect,
are the internal instruments. Senses are beyond, (superior,
stronger, wider, subtler and illuminator) the physical body,
while intellect is, body and senses. Ego which is the doer,
is beyond intellect and desire resides, in the ego. The self
is sentient, unaltered (uniform) and an embodiment of truth,
consciousness, and bliss consolidated. But when It identifies
Itself with the insentient body etc., ego is born and the self,
becomes the doer or agent. Thus the doer (agent) has two
aspects—the insentient one and the sentient one. A man (the
"
468,"Verse 42-43] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 427
embodied soul), because of the insentient aspect, is attracted
towards the world ie., the worldly desires are born, while
because of the sentient aspect, he is attracted towards God or |
the spiritual discipline.* As the insentient aspect is perishable, .
so are the worldly desires, and as the sentient aspect, is eternal,
so are the spiritual desires (needs). The mundane desires, are
renounced, while the spiritual ones (of the renunciation of the -
world, of Self-realization, of devotion to God), are satisfied.
The mundane desires can appear, but cannot exist, while the
spiritual desires-can be suppressed but cannot perish, because -
the former are unreal while the latter are real. Therefore, a
striver should neither hope for the fulfilment of the mundane
desires, nor lose heart by thinking of the non-fulfilment of
spiritual desires. 7
In fact, the only desire of a man (the soul) is to realize
God, Whose fragment he is. But by identifying himself with
the body etc., he, by an error of judgment, forgets the real 7
desire, and hankers after worldly pleasures and prosperity. But,
the real never ceases to be. The desire for the real can never -
be destroyed. In a striver two sorts of desire remain—one for
God-realization and the other, for worldly pleasures. So, there is
a duel between the two. It 1s because of the duel, that when a
striver practises spiritual discipline such as adoration, meditation .
and good company etc., his spiritual desires are aroused, but at
* The identification of the self with the body etc., can be explained by
an illustration. A block of iron with four edges has no burning power but when
by coming into contact with fire it identifies itself with fire, it develops the
burning power and fire, in spite of having no edges, becomes of four edges.
But a magnet attracts only iron, not fire because iron and magnet belong
to the same class and the fire automatically calms down. In the same way
when there is_ identification of the self with the body, the sentient portion
is attracted towards God, while the insentient towards the world. When the
sentient portion is attracted towards God the insentient is left because it is
perishable. But when the insentient portion is attracted towards the world, the
sentient One remains because it is eternal.
"
469,"428 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3 /
other times he hankers after worldly pleasures and prosperity.
While having mundane desire, a striver cannot even resolve,
that he has to practise spiritual discipline. He cannot progress ;
in the spiritual path, so long as spiritual desire, is not aroused. .
When he resolves, that he has only to realize God, the duel
ceases and only the keen spiritual desire remains, which enables
him to realize God easily (Gita 5/3). So, for a striver it is -
indispensable to root out this duel, between mundane desire
and the spiritual one. -

The self, has an automatic attraction or inclination, towards

God whose fragment It is. This attraction is known, as devotion.

When the Self accepts Its affinity for the world, that devotion,

is suppressed and desire springs. So long as there is desire,
devotion (iove) is not, aroused. Without devotion, desire is not -
killed. The insentient fragment, hankers after sensual pleasures,

while the sentient one, is attracted towards God. Therefore, /
in fact, desire resides in the insentient fragment, but it is

so because the two are identified. When the sentient (self)

does not accept Its affinity for the insentient, desire perishes. ;
It means, that as soon as, the sentient (Self), renounces Its
affinity for the insentient (body etc.,) Ego’ (the identification |
of the self with the insentient) perishes and consequently,

desire perishes.

Desire abides, in the insentient fragment of ego. The
reason is, that an enjoyer can be attracted towards objects of
enjoyment of the world, (the world which is seen), the senses

and intellect:with which the world is seen, only if these belong
to the same class, because attraction is possible for the objects
of the same class only. As eyes are, attracted to the beautiful
colour or form, so is the case with other senses. Intellect is
attracted towards discrimination or thought, not to sound etc.
If it is attracted, it is, because of its association with senses. ,
"
470,"Verse 42-43] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 429 |
Similarly, the self has Its identity with God, and so It is attracted
towards God. This identity, can be realized only when the Self
totally renounces, Its affinity for the insentient (Matter). As
soon as, this identity is realized, devotion (Love) is aroused,
in which there is total lack of matter (the unreal).
The insentient fragment, ‘causal body’, is a very subtle
fragment of the cosmic intelligence, which is an evolute of
nature. Desire, resides in this causal body. It is because of the ~
identification of the self with the causal body, that desire seems
to reside in the self. When there is no identification, a man ~
realizes the self which is pure and uniform. In that case, desire
perishes totally.
'Evam buddheh param buddhva'—In the previous verses,
it has been explained, ""The senses are greater than the body, _
greater than the senses, is the mind and greater than the mind
is the intellect."" But now in this verse, when the Lord declares,
that greater than intellect, is desire, He means to say, that desire -
resides in ‘ego', not in the self. Had it resided in the self, it
' might have never perished. It is born, when the self accepts -
its affinity for the insentient body etc. In fact, it resides in the
insentient fragment, (matter), but appears in the Self. Therefore,
knowing. this desire, which is beyond intellect, a striver should
eliminate it.
‘Samstabhyaétmanamatmana'— The method, to slay this desire,
is to restrain, the self by the self viz., to accept the real affinity
of the self, for the pure self or for God whose fragment It is.
The same fact, has been pointed out by the Lord, in the fifth
and the sixth verses of the sixth chapter when he declares, ""One
Should raise oneself by one's self alone"" and ""The self has been
conquered by the self.”
The self is a fragment of God, while the body, senses, mind
and intellect are fragments of the world. When the self having a |
"
471,"430 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
disinclination for God, has an inclination to nature (the world),
. desires are born, Desires are bom, when there is privation and
a man (the self) feels it, because of his affinity for the world,
because the world is unreal, has no existence (Gita 2/16) but
like a mirage, it seems to exist. As soon as, the affinity for
the world is renounced, desires perish, because the self has no
deficiency as the Lord declares, ""The real never suffers any
deficiency"" (Gita 2/16). -
Even when, a man has disinclination for God, and
assumes his affinity for the world, his real desire (need or
hunger) remains to realize God, whose, fragment he (the self)
is. He wants to remain alive forever, he wants to possess
all knowledge and he wants to be happy forever—this is
his desire to attain God, who is the Embodiment of Truth, _
Consciousness and Bliss. But, it is because of his affinity for
the world, that by an error of judgment, he wants to satisfy
this desire (need), by enjoying worldly pleasures. But this _
desire, can never be satisfied with worldly objects, so it will
have to be discarded. | ~
He, who has established his affinity, for the world, is also
capable of renouncing it. So the Lord orders Arjuna, to slay
this desire by dissociating himself from the world, through his
own efforts.
This dissociation, needs no practice because practice is done
with the help of the world (body, senses, mind and intellect).
In fact, a man gets established in the self or realizes God,
by renouncing affinity for the world.
When the self accepts Its affinity, for the world, it has a
desire to enjoy worldly pleasures, as well as, to realize God.
He (the self) by an error wants to satisfy the need for God-
"
472,"Verse 42-43] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 431
realization (who is Truth, Consciousness and Bliss) by worldly
materials. Therefore, both his desires, remain unfulfilled.

A man can know the world, by dissociating himself from :
it, and the Lord, by identifying himself with Him, because he
(the self) is different from the world, while he has identity
with God. But he accepts his identity or affinity, for the world,
in order to acquire worldly things, which is never possible. ~
Similarly, he accepts that he is different from God which
is also not a reality. Spiritual desire, is necessary, in order -
to root out worldly desires. When spiritual desires grow up
mundane desires, automatically, perish. When mundane desires,
are rooted out, spiritual desire is satisfied viz., God, Who 1s
ever attainable, is attained.* God always pervades everywhere, -
but a man does not realize Him, because of his entanglement
with worldly desires. .

_ ‘Jahi Satrurh mahabaho kamaritpam durasadam'—The term 7
""Mahabaho’ means, one possessed of long and mighty arms Le.,
a brave warrior. By addressing Arjuna, as 'mahabaho’, the Lord -
means that he is brave enough to slay the enemy, in the form
of desire.

It is hard for a man to conquer this enemy, so long as |
he has affinity for the world. This desire, deviates even the
wise from the performance of their duty, by covering their
discrimination, and so they have a downfall. Therefore, the |
Lord has said, that it is hard to conquer. So, a striver, instead
of losing heart, should be aware of this enemy.

Desires appear and disappear, whether these are fully

* When all the desires of a striver are rooted out, the mortal man
becomes immortal and he very well realizes the Eternal"" (Kathopanisad 2/3/14;
Brhadaranyaka 4/4/7).

""O Lotus eyed! when a man renounces all his desires he attains God-
realization” (Srimadbhagavata 7/10/9).
"
473,"432, $RIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
satisfied or partly satisfied, or not satisfied at all, while the
self ever remains uniform, and knows their appearance and
disappearance. So he can easily renounce his affinity for
them, which is merely assumed. Therefore, a striver should
not be afraid of desire, if he is determined* to attain his
aim, he can slay ‘desire’, very easily.
Everyone is independent, qualified, deserving and able
to realize God, but it is not so with desire, because these
can never be satiated. The Lord, has bestowed upon beings
this human body, so that they may attain Him. So they can |
easily renounce desires, but it is because of their attachment
to the worldly persons and objects etc., that it seems difficult
to renounce desires. |

The Lord, creates unfavourable circumstances, so that ~
man may be warned, not to have desire for favourable
circumstances, otherwise these will lead him to suffering. It _
is a rule that he who has a desire for worldly persons and
objects, cannot escape pain. The Lord declares, ""The pleasures ;
that are born of contacts (with objects) are only sources, of
pain (Gita 5/22).

The soul possesses infinite strength. It is because of the ,

power derived from the soul, that intellect, mind and senses,

seem powerful. But It forgets Its strength because of Its affinity
for the insentient, and regards itself as subordinate to the |
intellect, mind and senses etc. Therefore, it is necessary to
know ‘the Self, and recognize Its power, in order to kill the
enemy in the form of desire.

*A man's only aim is to attain the imperishable Lord, not the perishable
world. He has a desire to acquire the perishable objects. Aim remains the same
constantly while desire change. Aim is realized while desires may or may not be
satisfied but they disappear. A man wants to realize his aim (God) even though
his body may be broken into pieces.
"
474,"Verse 42-43] SADHAKA-SANJIVANT | 433 .
Desire, is born out of affinity of the self, for the insentient
(Matter) and it resides in it, but seems to reside in the self.
If one does not accept affinity for the insentient, desire has |
no existence. Therefore, when the Lord urges Arjuna, to slay.
desire, He means to say, that desire has no existence of
its own. A desire appears and it automatically disappears.
So, if one has no new desires, the old ones automatically ;
disappear. : |
A man becomes aware of something wanting in himself, _
only when he regards the worldly objects, such as the body
etc., as ‘I’, 'mine’ and ‘for me', but he wants to make up for
the lack, by worldly materials. So, he has desire to acquire
these. But it is impossible to make up that lack, by those
materials because he (the self) is imperishable, while these -
are perishable. Thus, he by desiring transitory objects, gains
nothing, but suffering. Therefore, by calling desire an enemy, -
the Lord urges Arjuna to slay it.
This desire can be easily eliminated through the Discipline
of Action, because a striver following the Discipline of :
Action, performs every major or minor act, for the good of
others, rather than to satiate his own desire. All his actions
are performed, for the welfare of others without any selfish
motive. All his resources, are not his own, but have been
acquired and are likely to be lost. So, he uses, them, for the |
welfare of the world, by regarding these as the world's,
without any selfish motive. Thus, he gets rid of desires easily,
and consequently, attains his aim of God-realization. Then,
nothing further remains to be done, to be known, and to be
acquired for him.
Appendix—Here the Lord has mentioned senses, mind and
intellect but He has not mentioned ‘ego’. Ego is greater than
intellect. In the fourth verse of the seventh chapter also the
"
475,"434 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
Lord has mentioned ego after intellect-—‘bhiimirapo’nalo vayuh
kharh mano buddhireva ca, ahankara itiyarh me .....’. Therefore
here also the term ‘sah’ should be interpreted as ‘desire’ which
abides in ego. | :

Unless and until the self is realized, desire abides in
ego. After Self-realization desire does not persist in ego—
‘param drstva nivartate’ (Gita 2/59). Bliss abides in the self
but a man by according reality and importance to non- -
self wants to derive pleasure from it. As long as there is
affinity for the non-self, desire persists but when affinity ~
for the non-self (inert matter) is renounced, then ‘Prema’

(real love) ensues.

The desire is in the self—‘raso’pyasya’ (Gita 2/59).
Being in the self it is an obstacle to Self-realization. If it is -
not in the self but is in. senses-mind-intellect, how is it an
obstacle to Self-realization by us? It is because of its abode
in the self that the self feels happy and sad and becomes a -
doer and an enjoyer. In fact the desire does not abide in the
self but it is merely an assumption and therefore it can be -
wiped out. Therefore desire is seated in the. self only through
assumption.

A man assumes a thing, which abides in ego, to be abiding
in the self. Ego is identified with the self and desire abides
in that ego. Therefore so long as ego persists, attraction viz.,
‘desire’, which belongs to the same class to which ego belongs, |
persists and when ego perishes, then attraction viz., ‘true love’
belonging to the class of the ‘self’ ensues. In desire there is
attraction for the world while in true love there is attraction
for God.

Ali the three worlds and endless universes are ‘sense-
objects’. Sense-objects are in one region of senses, senses
are in one region of the mind, the mind is in one region of
"
476,"Verse 42-43] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 435 -
the intellect, the intellect is in one region of the ego and the |
ego is in one region of the self. Therefore the self is very
huge within which there are all the three worlds and endless
universes. But a man (the self) by assuming his affinity for -
ego, a fragment of lower (insentient) nature, feels himself
very small (unipresent).

Fourth Chapter | ©
| INTRODUCTION :

The Lord, in the thirty-ninth verse of the second chapter,
said to Arjuna, ""This is the wisdom of Sankhya given to thee, to
attain equanimity, O Arjuna. Now listen; about equanimity to be _
acquired, through the Discipline of Action, in which a person by _
performing action for the welfare of others, without any selfish -
motive, attains equanimity.” Thus according to the context, in
response to Arjuna’s question, Lord Krsna having described the
marks of a man of steady wisdom, completes this topic.

At the beginning of the third chapter, Arjuna asked Lord
Krsna, ""If You think that knowledge is superior to action, why -
do You urge me, to do this savage deed (war)?"" In response
to his question, the Lord, from the fourth to the twenty-ninth
verses, lays emphasis on the performance of actions, by which -
a man attains equanimity. In the thirtieth verse, He says that
surrendering all actions to Him, with a discriminative insight, ”
free from desire and egoism he should perform actions without
mental agitation. In the thirty-first and thirty-second verses, He
declares the sweet fruit of following His preaching (explained |
in the previous verse) and the harm in not following it. In the
thirty-fifth verse, He declares, ""Better is death in one's own
duty.” In the thirty-sixth verse Arjuna asks, ""By what is a man 7
impelled to commit sin?"" The Lord replies, ""It is desire, all
devouring and most sinful, which is the enemy,"" and ordered
Arjuna to slay this enemy.

Though, the Lord's teaching continues from the thirty-
seventh verse, yet in the forty-third verse, when the answer to
Arjuna's question is over, sage Veda Vyasa concludes the third
chapter, and begins the fourth chapter. It shows that the Lord
"
479,"438 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4
having answered Arjuna's question, takes a pause and then starts
again, the Discipline of Action, which was being described in

the forty-seventh and forty-eighth verses of the second chapter,

by the term ‘Imam’ (This) in the first verse of the fourth chapter. _ -
Therefore, the fourth chapter is regarded, as an appendix to the
third chapter. |

There are two important factors pertaining to the Discipline
of Action—(1) Performance of actions and, (2) special knowledge -
about action. Arjuna wants to renounce the performance of action,
so he says to Lord Krsna, ""Why do You ask me to be engaged __
in this savage deed?"" Therefore, the Lord, lays special emphasis
on the performance of duty, specially in the third chapter, while
in the fourth chapter, He imparts knowledge about actions. He
declares, ""I shall teach thee such action, (the nature of action
and inaction), after knowing which, thou shalt be liberated from = ~—
evil (the wheel of birth and death) (4/16).

This Karmayoga, in spite of being without beginning, was |
lost to the world through, a long lapse of time, because of the
absence of scholarly teachers (sages), who could impart it. The
Lord, in the first three verses, describing how Karmayoga was. |
handed down from ancient times, proves how it existed from
times immemorial.

imam vivasvate yogam proktavanahamavyayam
vivasvanmanave praha  manuriksvakave'bravit
The Blessed Lord said: : |

I taught this imperishable Yoga to Vivasvan (the sun-god); who

expounded it to Manu, and Manu proclaimed it to Iksvaku. 1
"
480,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 439
Comment:—
""Imam vivasvate yogam proktavanahamavyayam'—The kings,
such as Surya, Manu and Iksvaku, who have been mentioned by
the Lord, were householders and they attained perfection, through |
the Discipline of Action, leading a householder's life. Therefore,
here the words 'Imam, avyayam yogam’' (this imperishable Yoga)
stand for 'Karmayoga’, (the Discipline of Action).
Though Karmayoga has been described in the Puranas °
(historical records), and Upanisads (philosophical parts of the
Vedas) also, yet it is not as thoroughly detailed, as in the Gita. -
The Lord 1s eternal, His fragment, the soul is also eternal and
so is the affinity of soul for the Lord. Therefore, all the disciplines
(of Action, Knowledge and Devotion) are also eternal.* Here,
the term ‘Avyayam’ shows, that Karmayoga is eternal.
The affinity of the soul for God is eternal. Just as a chaste
wife does not have to make effort to be dear to her husband,
in the like manner, a striver does not have to put in any effort, -
in order to belong to God. But, when he accepts his affinity
for perishable actions, objects and incidents etc., he does not
realize his eternal affinity for God. Therefore, a Karmayogi, in
order to, renounce his assumed affinity for the world, utilizes his
body, senses, mind and intellect etc., for rendering service to the
world, by regarding them as the world's. He thinks, that just as
the smallest particle of dust, is a fragment of the huge earth, so
is the body, a fragment of the vast universe. By accepting this
belief, ‘Karmas' (actions) will be performed, for the world, but |
‘Yoga’ (Nityayoga or eternal union) will be for himself i.e., he
will realize his eternal union with God.
By the terms ‘Vivasvate proktavan’, the Lord wants to
explain to the strivers that as the sun in the solar system while
performing its action by providing heat and light, remains
* Lord Krsna declares in the eighth chapter of the Gita that the bright and
the dark paths of the world are verily thought to be eternal (Gita 8/26).
"
481,"440 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4
unengrossed; similarly, all the strivers should perform actions _
without attachment according to available circumstances, (Gita
3/19). They should, also impart this teaching of Karmayoga, to
others for the public welfare by remaining unengrossed (without ~
desire for fruit, without a sense of 'mine’ and without attachment).

The sun-god, was king at the beginning of creation. Lord
Krsna taught this imperishable Yoga to the sun-god. It means,
that Lord Krsna was the first preceptor in the beginning, and ~
so has Karmayoga come from times immemorial. It seems that
the Lord, tells Arjuna, ""Whatever teaching about 'Karmayoga I -
am imparting to you, is not new but eternal."" |

Question:—Why did the Lord teach this Yoga to the sun-
god, at the beginning of creation?

Answer:—(1) The Lord taught it to him, because He knew __
that he was a deserving candidate.

(2) Such teaching is imparted to the first born, as Brahma,
the creator, who created man and imparted teaching to them —
(Gita 3/10), in order to, inspire them to perform their duty. In the
universe also, the sun-god was the first born, and then the entire -
universe was born of him. The Lord, taught this Yoga, first of all
to the sun-god.* He meant to get it imparted, through the sun-god
to all his progeny, by way of transmission by succession.

(3) The sun, is the eye of entire creation. He imparts
knowledge to all the people and when he rises, they wake up
and are engaged in their work. He sets an example to them for
the performance of their duty. He has been called, the soul of
the entire world}. Therefore, teaching imparted to the sun-god

* In the scriptures the sun-god has been called 'Savita’ which means the
creator. The western scholars also regard the Sun as the creator.

f Inthe Mahabharata it has been said addressing the sun-god, ""O sun-god, you
are the eye of the entire world and the soul of all beings. You are the birth-place
and the inspirer of the good conduct of the followers of the path of action.""

""You are the abode which should be attained by the Sankhyayogis. You
"
482,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 441
will also be communicated to all beings. Therefore, Lord Krsna
first of all, taught this imperishable Yoga to the sun-god.
In fact, this teaching imparted by Lord Krsna (the manager
of the world-theatre), to the sun-god, is a drama staged by Him, |
for the welfare of the world. As Lord Krsna taught Arjuna, the
incarnation of Nara, the wise sage, for the welfare of the world,
so did He teach, this Yoga to the sun-god, the embodiment of
knowledge, for the welfare of the entire wotld. This Yoga has 7
done a lot of good to the world, is doing and will continue to
do, in future also. -
'Vivasvanmanave praha manuriksvakave'bravit'— Karmayoga,
is the main course of action for householders. Out of celibacy,
household life, the retired and the renounced, orders—the
four stages (orders) of life—household life is most important, -
because it is a householder that provides for the other stages of
_ life. A householder, by performing his duty, can easily realize
God. He need not change the order of life. Lord Krsna in -
mentioning the names of the kings, such as the sun-god, Manu
and Iksvaku, wants to say, that at the beginning of creation, -
they as householders, having slain desires, realized God. Lord
Krsna and Arjuna were also householders. Therefore, Lord Krsna -
through Arjuna, teaches all householders that they can realize
God, as householders, without leading a secluded life as ascetics
by performing their duty.
In spite of being a householder, Arjuna thinks that it is
better to live, in this world even by begging than to perform
a savage deed, of slaying honoured teachers in war (Gita 2/5)
viz., he thinks that the renounced order of life is superior to
the household life. Therefore, the Lord says to him that he is a
are the base of Karmayogis. You are the free gateway to salvation and you are
the refuge for the salvation-seekers. You hold the entire world. This world is
illumined by you. You sanctify it and it is preserved by you without any selfish
motive (Vanaparva 3/36—38).
"
483,"442 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4

noble householder of the royal family. So performance of actions _

will lead him to salvation, in the same way, as renunciation leads

an ascetic to salvation. Karmayoga, consists in the utilization

of available circumstances. So Karmayoga (the Discipline of —

Action), can be followed by people of every caste, creed, country

and ofder of life.

- The Lord, has mentioned the names of noble and influential
kings of the past, so that people may draw inspiration from them, —~

| in order to perform their duty. ,
.

Attachment (affinity) for actions and objects, is a stumbling
block to Karmayoga. When a householder renounces pleasure,
his zest also comes to an end. When a person starts enjoying
pleasure, such as eating a sweet dish, he relishes it very much. -
But, as he goes on eating it, the taste diminishes and finally,
it ceases. But, he commits an error, as he does not make that _
distaste permanent, by attaching importance to it. He regards this
distaste as satisfaction, (reward). But the fact is, that is the state
of deficiency in which he has no power of having pleasure. :

The interest or desire which diminishes or perishes, cannot
be the characteristic of the self and therefore, It (the self) has no
real affinity for the objects etc., which he desires or wants. Our
teal affinity is, for God and therefore, devotion while following
a spiritual path for God-realization, 1s ever enhanced. Even when,
he realizes God, his devotion increases continuously, and it is
transformed into love (devotion). The self, is also real, so no
one has a desire in the least for one's own negation.

When actions, instruments (body, senses and mind etc.,)
objects and materials, are perishable how can these bear
imperishable fruit? How can pleasure and satisfaction, be derived
from the fruit of. perishable things to match the pleasure and
satisfaction, achieved on God-realization? Therefore, astriverhas
"
484,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 443 :
to renounce his affinity for actions, instruments (such as body,
senses and mind etc.,) and objects. He can renounce this affinity,
only when he does nothing for himself, wants nothing for himself
and regards nothing as his own. But he utilizes everything, by |
regarding it as of the world in rendering service, to the world.
A Karmayogi, performs actions scrupulously and lovingly,
without desire, attachment and feeling of ‘mine’. Desire, attachment
and a sense of ‘mine’ pollute actions, while careful and loving .
nature, purifies these. When actions are performed with desire,
attachment and a sense of mine, objects are destroyed, and man _
has a downfall. The thought of actions come to the mind, time
and again i.e., affinity for those actions continues. But when
actions are performed scrupulously, devotedly and lovingly, there
is proper use of objects, and man is elevated and the thought of
actions do not come to mind i.e., affinity for these is renounced. -
As soon as, this affinity for actions is totally renounced, a striver
realizes the self or God, who is ever present and existent.
Everyone, can easily assume that whatever he possesses 1s
not his own, but is acquired, just as he has acquired the body
from parents, education and knowledge from preceptors and so -
on. It means that every man, even the richest one, has to depend
on others, in one way or the other. So, it is his duty to render
service to others, with all his possessions, because he has acquired |
them from others. This, is known as Karmayoga, no one is
dependent and unable to follow it and for its practice.
In fact, duty is that which can be performed easily, which |
must be performed and by performing which a man certainly
attains his aim. A man is not responsible for the performance of
action, which he cannot perform. And, what is forbidden, must
not be done. When a person does not perform forbidden actions,
he either does nothing or he performs only prescribed actions.
Duty is always performed, for the welfare of others, without
expecting any reward. Actions, with the expectation of reward,
"
485,"444 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4
should not be performed, because these lead to bondage. But, it
_ does not mean that actions are performed, without any aim. An
act without any aim, cannot be performed by anyone, except by
insane person. There is a vast difference, between fruit (reward)
and aim. Reward, is perishable while aim is eternal. A man's’.
aim is to attain God who is ever attainable, and for which this
human life has been bestowed upon him. He cannot realize
God, without performing his duty, in a disinterested manner. _
He cannot perform his duty, so long as he indulges, in reward
for actions, heedlessness and indolence etc. |
In fact, performance of duty needs no effort, it is performed
automatically. But when a man performs action for himself with
egoism, attachment, desire and a sense of 'mine’, it involves
effort. Therefore, the Lord declares, ""Action which involves strain
(effort), is said to be of the nature of passion"" (Gita 18/24). -
As the Lord, is ever engaged in the welfare of all beings, so
is His power. As a news broadcast by a particular radio station, _
_ 1s received on the same frequency by radio-sets, similarly, when
a Karmayogi performs all his actions for the welfare of the
world without any selfish motive, his power, is identified with —~
the all-pervading, benevolent power of God and his actions
become uncommon. Thus, because of Lord's power, his actions
are conducive to the welfare of the world. Therefore, there is
_ heither any obstacle in the way of performing his duty nor does
| it involve any strain.
- A man, can perform his duty without depending on any _
| person or circumstance. According to Karmayoga (the Discipline of
Action), giving help to others according to their need, is service.
When the engine of a car goes out of order and the driver is
trying to push it forward, if someone helped him, it is service.
But,. he who looks for service, does not render real service,
but he performs actions, only because by doing so, his aim is
mundane rather than spiritual. Service 1s rendered according to
"
486,"Verse 2] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 445
available circumstances. Therefore, a Karmayogi neither changes
circumstances nor does he seek these but utilizes these. The
utilization of the available circumstances, is Karmayoga.

This Yoga handed down thus, in regular succession, came to
- the royal sages. But through long lapse of time, it was lost to the
world, O oppressor of the foes (Arjuna). 2
Comment:—
""Evarh paramparapraptamimam rajarsayo viduh'— The kings,
such as the sun-god, Manu and Iksvaku, learnt the Karmayoga,
followed it and also, inspired their subjects to follow it. Thus, -
it was handed down in regular succession to the families of |
the royal sages. This Karmayoga is a special lare of the kings -
(the warrior class). Therefore, every member of the warrior class
should know it. Similarly, the heads and leaders of a family,
society, village and town etc., must also know it. |
In ancient days, the kings who knew Karmayoga, administered
the affairs of state smoothly, without being attached to royal
pleasures. They had a natural inclination for the welfare of the
subjects. The great Sarhskrta poet Kalidasa writes about the kings
of solar dynasty:—
""Those kings levied a tax on their subjects in the same way,
as the sun sucks water from the earth, in order to supply it to
the earth in the form of rain, a thousand times more."" |
It means, that the tax realized from the subjects by kings,
was all used for public welfare. In order to, provide for their
household expenses, they followed occupations, like farming.
"
487,"446 : SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 4 |
By practising Karmayoga, they were automatically endowed with,
singular knowledge and devotion. Therefore, even great sages
went to those kings, in order to learn wisdom. Sri Vedavyasa's
son named Sukadeva, went to king Janaka, in order to gain
wisdom from him. In the fifth chapter of the Chandogyopanisad
it is mentioned, that six sages together went to king Asvapati,
in order to learn knowledge of Brahma, the Supreme.* Having
mentioned kings, such as Janaka and others in the twentieth verse ~
of the third chapter, and the sun-god, Manu and Iksvaku etc.,
here, as Karmayogis, Lord Krsna wants to urge Arjuna that he -
should also perform actions accordingly (follow Karmayoga) as the
ancestors did, in former times, as he was also a householder and
a member of the warrior class (Gita 4/15). Moreover, it was very
easy for him to learn it, because he belonged to the warrior class.

'Sa kaleneha mahata yogo nastah'— God is eternal and the -
means—Karmayoga, Jnanayoga and Bhaktiyoga (Disciplines of
Action, Knowledge and Devotion) etc., are also eternal, as they -
have been laid down by God. Therefore, they never cease to be.

The Lord declares, ""The real, never ceases to be"" (Gita 2/16).

The yogas are eternal, even if these are not practised. Therefore, ;
here the term ‘Nastah' means, passing out of sight, rather than

out of existence.

In the first verse of this chapter, this Yoga has been called

imperishable. Therefore, if this term 'Nastah' is taken as ‘out
of existence’ there will be a contradiction between the two
statements. Moreover, the Lord again in the third verse declares, |
that He is going to reveal the same ancient Yoga, to Arjuna.
It means that the religious texts and the learned sages who
possessed knowledge of this Yoga, and practised it, had more
or less disappeared from the earth.

* King ASsvapati declares, ""In my kingdom there is neither a thief, nor a

' miser, nor a drunkard, nor one who does not offer oblation to the consecrated
fire, nor an ignorant person nor an adulterer; then how can there be a prostitute”
(Chandogyopanisad 5/1 1/5)?
"
488,"Verse 2] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 447
The Lord declares, that it was through a long lapse of time, |
that it disappeared, because at the beginning of creation, the Lord
taught it to the sun-god, then it was handed down in regular
succession and the royal sages come to know it. But due to the ~
absence of great spiritual souls, possessed of the knowledge of
this Yoga, it could not be handed down. So, at present only a
few people know and talk about it. |
Though this doctrine was not practised, yet it did not cease -
to be, because without selflessness, which is the essence of
Karmayoga even other disciplines (such as of knowledge and _
devotion) cannot be constantly practised. A Jnanayogi through
discrimination, by regarding actions as 'Asat' (unreal), renounces
his affinity for these, while a Bhaktiyogi renounces affinity for
them by surrendering these to God. No affinity, howsoever, is to
be maintained. This is the doctrine of 'Karmayoga’'. Therefore, a -
Jnanayogi and a Bhaktiyogi will have to adopt the principles of
""Karmayoga’, even though they may not practise it. It means, that
at present, though it has been lost, yet as a doctrine it exists. -
The fact is, that in Karmayoga, Karma (actions) have not
disappeared but 'Yoga' (selflessness) has disappeared, because a -
man performs actions with a selfish motive. It means, that strivers
have a firm belief that they will attain God, through actions in
the same way as they acquire worldly things through actions.
But they forget the reality, that God is, ever attained. Actions,
are performed for the world while ""Yoga'’ (union with God) is,
ever for one's own self. Yoga is not attained through actions, as
is self-evident.* Therefore, the generality of the assumption that
* Yoga is attained by performing one's duty for the welfare of the world
without any selfish motive. Action is performed in order to attain the state of
actionlessness— Action is said to be the means to attain to Yoga’ (Gita 6/3). When
actions are performed with a selfish motive, the impetus for actions is enhanced.
But when they are performed for the welfare of others the impetus for actions
perishes. It means that nothing remains to be done by doing for others while
actions are continuously performed when one does for himself. When nothing
remains to be done, the striver realizes his union (which is self-evident) with God. .
"
489,"448 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4 :
this Yoga can be attained through action, has practically caused |
the disappearance of yoga.
This human body, has been bestowed upon us, so that we
may practise Karmayoga i.e., serve others without any selfish |
motive. But,. we are so much absorbed in hankering after |
pleasures, prosperity and honour etc., that we do not pay heed
to it. Thus, this knowledge has been lost, because we have
forgotten it. -
A man by rendering service can control not only birds, beasts
and persons but also the gods, manes, sages, saints and even -
God. But having forgotten this practice, he has been overpowered
by pleasures, which lead to hell and eighty-four lac forms of
lives. This is called concealment of Karmayoga.

Comment:— | |
*Bhakto'si me sakha ceti'—Arjuna regarded Lord Krsna, as his
companion (comrade) (Gita 11/41-42) but now he has become .
His pupil (Gita 2/7) 1.e., earlier he was a comrade-devotee, while
now, he has become a disciple-devotee. An order can be given
or a sermon can be preached, only to a disciple rather than to
a friend. The Lord preached His sermon, only when Arjuna
surrendered to Him 1.e., took refuge in Him.
The secret, which is not disclosed even to a comrade, is
revealed to a disciple, who surrenders himself to his preceptor.
"
490,"Verse 3] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI - 449
Arjuna also says to Lord Krsna, ""I am Thy disciple, teach me, .
who have taken refuge in Thee."" Therefore, the Lord reveals
His secret to him.

- It was because of Arjuna’s reverence for Lord Krsna, that |
he, instead of opting for a well-equipped army chose unarmed
Lord Krsna alone, (as his chariot-driver).*

‘Common people, regard the objects bestowed upon them
by God as theirs (while in fact they are not theirs), but they do .
not regard the Lord, (Who is actually theirs), as theirs. They,
instead of having an eye on the glorious Lord, look at His glory. -
Having attached importance to the glory, their intellect becomes
so dull, that they do not even believe, in His existence 1.e., they
do not even look towards Him. Some people adore Him, in
order to gain riches and glory etc. Though riches lie at the feet .
of devotees, yet true devotees do not adore Him for riches, but
they adore Him to attain Him. Those who hanker after riches, are
devotees (slaves) to riches, while those who want to attain God, -
are His real devotees. Arjuna, having abandoned riches or glory
(well-armed Narayani army), chose Lord Krsna. Consequently, :
it was only he, to whom the gospel of the Gita was preached
on the battlefield, though there were other great souls such as
Bhisma, Drona, Yudhisthira etc., near by. Finally Arjuna was
able to regain the kingdom also. _
‘Sa evayam maya te'dya yogah proktah puratanah'—By these

terms, the Lord does not mean to say, that He has given a full |
description of this Yoga, but it means that whatever has been
declared by Him is complete in itself. Further, having answered
Arjuna's question concerning His manifestation (incarnation),
the Lord, again starts the topic of Karmayoga.

_* ""Having heard the words of Lord Krsna Arjuna, the son of Kunti , chose
unarmed Lord Krsna as his helper while he could have chosen the well-armed
Narayani army consisting of 1,09,350 foot soldiers, 65,610 horses, 21,870
chariots and 21,870 elephants"" (Mahabharata, Udyogaparva 7/21).
"
491,"450 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4 -

The Lord declares, that the same Karmayoga, which was
taught to the sun-god at the beginning of the creation, has been
taught to Arjuna. He declares that through long lapse of time,
this Yoga was lost to the world and he also was not manifest. ,
Now he has manifested Himself and has also revealed this Yoga :
again. Therefore, Karmayoga, which has liberated people from
bondage of actions from time immemorial, will also liberate
them today. -

""Rahasyam hyetaduttamam'—As the Lord teaches His supreme
secret to Arjuna, in the sixty-sixth verse of the eighteenth chapter, _
by declaring, ""Take refuge in Me alone; I shall then liberate thee
from all sins."" Here also, He discloses His supreme secret by
declaring, ""I taught this imperishable Yoga to the sun-god at the
beginning of creation and I am preaching the same to you today.""

The Lord seems to say to Arjuna that though He, while -
playing the role of his chariot-driver, is obeying him, yet He is
preaching to him the same Yoga, which was taught to the sun- 7
god at the beginning of creation. He is disclosing this secret to :
him, because He is his devotee and also a loving friend.

Not to talk of a common man, even a striver, pays attention
to the preaching, but he does not pay attention to the preacher.
Having listened to this sermon on Yoga and having studied it,

a striver thinks over it, and he does not take the preacher as the
omnipresent, Lord Krsna Himself. So, the Lord, by using the
term Rahasyam' (secret) introduces Himself and urges a striver
to behold Him, ever.

When the Lord declares that He preached the gospel of
Yoga to the sun-god and is preaching the same to him, He also
means to say, that He is the preacher or the preceptor, of the
entire humanity. As an actor, while playing his role does not
disclose his identity to the audience, but reveals it to his bosom
friend; the Lord also discloses to His devout devotee, His identity.

This is His supreme secret.
"
492,"Verse 3] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 451 |
Karmayoga, can also be regarded as a supreme secret. The
supreme secret is, that actions which bind a man (the soul), may
also liberate him from bondage. If actions are performed with a
selfish motive, by regarding the objects as one's own, these lead
him to bondage. But, if these are performed, without any selfish
motive for the welfare of others, they lead him to liberation
(salvation). This Karmayoga, can be practised independent of all
the circumstances—favourable or unfavourable, riches or poverty,
health or sickness etc. :
While practising Karmayoga there are three important
factors, which need attention— -
(1) The self, is real (imperishable), while all the objects which
are acquired, are unreal (perishable). So, how can the perishable
be possessed by the imperishable? 'So nothing is mine.’
(2) 'I need nothing for myself', because the self lacks -
nothing. Moreover, how can the perishable objects be useful
for the imperishable self? :
(3) ‘Nothing is to be done for the self’. The first reason is,
that the self is a fragment of God, who is sentient, while actions
are insentient. The self is eternal, while actions and their fruits, ”
are transitory. Therefore, when anyone performs actions for the
self, he (the self), is attached to those actions and their fruits.
Actions and their fruits, disappear but attachment for these
continues, which is the cause of his birth and death. The Lord
declares, ""Attachment of the soul to the modes of nature, is the
cause of its births, in good and evil wombs” (Gita 13/21). |
The second reason is, that the responsibility for actions is
his, who can perform these i.e., who possesses the resources to
perform these, and who wants to acquire something or the other.
The self, being actionless, uniform, unchanging and perfect, can
do nothing, without accepting its affinity for the body. Therefore,
the self has nothing to do for itself.
The third reason, is that the self is real and perfect. It
"
493,"452 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4
lacks nothing. The Lord, declares, ""The real, never suffers any ,
deficiency.” (Gita 2/16). When It lacks nothing, there is no
question for It to have any desire, in order to acquire anything.
Therefore, It has to do nothing for Itself. |
In Karmayoga, Karmas (actions) are performed for the world, ,
while ‘Yoga’ (union with God) is for the self. When actions are |
performed for one's own self, one cannot realize one's union with
God. When the full flow of actions is towards the world, we -
realize ‘God, because the body, senses, mind, intellect, objects, .
riches and property etc., whatever we possess, is not different
from the world and is of the world. So, these are to be used
for rendering service, to the world. Therefore, actions are to
be performed for others, in order to renounce affinity for the
world, in the form of objects and actions. This is known as
Karmayoga. By this Karmayoga, the attachment for action, the _
desire to acquire and to live, and the fear of death, perish.

As, for actions performed, in the sunlight, the sun remains
detached, similarly, all action performed in the light of the self, -
the self also remains detached, because the self is sentient and
unchanging, while actions are insentient and changing. But when -
by an error, it accepts Its affinity even in the least, for objects
and actions 1.e., regards them as Its, and for it then those actions
bind It.

As the sun performs its duty always very punctually and
scrupulously, so does a Karmayogi perform his duty efficiently
and promptly. :

If Karmayoga is rightly followed, a Karmayogi, having

the influence of Jiana (Knowledge) attains knowledge, while
with a disposition of devotion, attains devotion, automatically.
By following Karmayoga, a striver does supreme good to the
entire world, whether other people perceive it or not, realize it
or not. He works as a fountain of inspiration for others, and thus
renders service to them.
"
494,"Verse 3] SADHAKA- SANJIVANI 453
The Lord, while beginning the gospel of the Gita, has
described, from the eleventh verse to the thirtieth verse of the
second chapter, that every being experiences or realizes, ‘I am’. °
Even trees and mountains feel this, though these cannot express _
it. This can be clearly seen among beasts and birds, because
they fight with each other, as they notice their own existence; -
otherwise why should they fight? ""I am distinct from the body
and the world""—this is a common experience of every human
being. It is called discrimination. As far as a man is concerned, -
he has been specially endowed with discrimination by God. The
pity is, that he does not respect it and use it appropriately.
Senses, mind and intellect, are the fragments of nature (prakrti)
and so whatever is known, through these, is knowledge born of -
nature. The knowledge of scriptures that is acquired through the
senses, mind and intellect, is also born of nature. The knowledge
of God, is far superior to this knowledge. Therefore, He can be 7
known only by the knowledge of the self. When a man attaches
importance to the knowledge of the self ie., discrimination ~
(wisdom), he develops the power to know ‘Who I am’, 'What is
mine’, ‘What is sentient and what is insentient'’, 'What is God and
what is nature (prakrti)'’, and so on. The same discrimination, is |
applied for Karmayoga also—this is something vital.
In Karmayoga, two important factors predominate—(1) There
is no doubt about one's own existence, 'I am'. (2) Whatever |
objects we possess are not ours, because these are acquired; these
were neither ours in the past, nor will remain ours, in future. 'T
(the self) remains the same while these objects—body, senses,
mind, intellect etc., are changeable and perishable. As actions
appear and disappear, so does their fruit. So actions and objects,
have their affinity for the world, not for the self. When this
discrimination (wisdom) is aroused, desire perishes. When desire
"
495,"454 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4 ;
perishes, self-evident actionlessness, is revealed 1.e., Karmayoga
is accomplished. : :
Discrimination (wisdom) is enveloped by desire (Gita
. 3/38-39). A man cannot discriminate between the right and
the wrong, because he hankers after worldly prosperity and
/ pleasures, in having a selfish motive. Thus, he cannot decide
what ought to be done and what ought not to be done. He wants
to find out a solution, to the riddles of life through the body, _
senses, mind and intellect or by changing the circumstances.
But circumstances cannot be changed by him. So he gets more -
and more entangled, and cannot decide his duty. But, when his
discrimination (wisdom) is aroused, he gets rid of the desire for
pleasure, prosperity and selfishness; and then he clearly sees his
duty, and then ail entanglements perish. |
Actions, bear fruit in the form of outward circumstances, such -
as riches and poverty, praise and blame, honour and dishonour,
fame and defame, profit and loss, birth and death and health
and sickness etc. He who becomes, either happy in favourable ;
circumstances or sad in unfavourable circumstances, by accepting
his affinity for them, is a fool. Why? The reason is, that he -
cannot change the circumstances, but he can rise above these
i.e., can remain detached from them, by making proper use. of
them. In favourable circumstances he should render service to
others, while under unfavourable conditions, he should neither
feel sad nor should he desire favourable circumstance. Such a
striver, easily gets liberated from worldly bondage.
Undesirable circumstances, are fruits of sinful actions. So,
sinful actions which hurt others should not be performed, even
in a dream. But in unfavourable circumstances, which are the
fruits of sinful actions of the past, worry, sadness and fear etc.,
automatically come to his mind, even though he does not commit
new sins. A striver, should not be attached to these. He should
believe that these come to his mind in the same way, as a cow
"
496,"Verse 4] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 455 :
whom he has sold visits his house, because of old habit. As
the cow stops, coming to his house and starts living in the new
place, similarly, when a striver does not get attached to these
feelings, these stop coming to his mind. :
Even when, discrimination (wisdom) is not fully aroused, a oo
Karmayogi has a determinate intellect, and he has to renounce
affinity for the perishable, which is not his and he has to render ;
service to the world without enjoying worldly pleasures. It is |
because of his determinate intellect, that he ceases attaching
importance to worldly pleasures. Then, he cannot be entangled ~
in the mirage of pleasures. Thus his determinate intellect, leads
him to salvation. Good company and the study of the scriptures
strengthen this intellect. Therefore, every striver should have
a firm intellect, that he has to attain salvation. Everyone is _
independent in having this determination, without seeking the
least help, from anyone else.

- ‘Aparam bhavato janma param janma vivasvatah'— Arjuna
asks Lord Krsna, that He was born in the house of Vasudeva
a few years ago, while Vivasvan (the sun-god) was born earlier :
at the beginning of creation. So how could he believe, that He -
had taught this Yoga to the sun-god. |
This question of Arjuna expresses his curiosity, rather than
argument or blame. He wants to hear from Lord Krsna, the
secret of His Divine descent, because only He was capable of
revealing this secret, to him. | -
'Kathametadvijaniyam tvamadau proktavaniti'— Arjuna asks
Lord Krsna, how he should understand that He had taught this -
Yoga at the beginning of creation; because He was born later while
the sun-god had been born earlier at the beginning of creation. As
the Lord had recounted about several generations of the sun-god, .
it proves that He had imparted this knowledge, much earlier.

His omniscience, to manifest His Divine descent.

"
498,"Verse 5] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 457 -
I know them all, but thou knowest not, O scorcher of foes. 5 |
Comment:—
[In the third verse, the Lord said to Arjuna, ""You are My
devotee and My friend."" So Arjuna put to Him a question,
quite frankly and without any hesitation. Arjuna was curious to /
know, the secret of His Divine descent. So the Lord reveals the
secret. When a devotee has curiosity to know some secret, the
saints also reveal it to him.* Saint Tulasidasa also declares in -
the Ramacaritamanasa—""Sages do not conceal a secret, when
they come across, a deserving hand"" (1/110/1).] ee
""Bahiini me vyatitani janmani tava carjuna'—Lord Krsna,
says to Arjuna that both of them have passed many births. But
His manifestation (which will be described in the sixth verse)
is different from his birth, (which will be described in the — _
nineteenth verse of the eighth chapter and the twenty-first and
the twenty-sixth verses of the thirteenth chapter).
In the twelfth verse of the second chapter, the Lord declared, -
""Never was there a time when I was not, or when you or these
kings were not, nor will there ever be, a time hereafter, when :
we all shall cease to be."" It means that God and His fraction,
soul—both are without beginning and eternal.
'Tanyaham veda sarvani'—There are some Yogis (ascetics),
who by practising spiritual discipline possess an intuitional
knowledge, and come to know of their previous births. Such
Yogis, are called “Yunjana yogis’. On the other hand, there are
* The saints remain concealed and don't reveal themselves. But they reveal
themselves in the following three cases.
(i) When a devout devotee having great reverence for those saints, has
curiosity to know them.
(11) When a devout devotee's body is cast off.
(iti) When the saint goes to cast off his body.
In the second and the third cases the saints reveal themselves even to those
devotees who have not so much of reverence for them, but they respect them from
their heart and want to know them.
"
499,"458 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4 -
other Yogis, who naturally know everything of the past births of |
all beings, without practising any spiritual discipline. The Lord

is such a 'Yuktayogi’ Who knows of the beings of the past, the
present and the future (Gita 7/26). Knowledge of God, knows no
bounds of past, present and future and it is constantly present. ~
The Lord in spite of pervading everywhere, everything, every
person, and every circumstances etc., transcends, them all.

[The Lord's statement, ""I know them all"" should thrill strivers -
with delight, because the Lord knows them and has an eye on
them, whatever they are.] | ee

""Na tvam vettha parantapa'—A man does not possess intuitional
knowledge to know of previous births as he is attached to perishable
objects and persons etc. Similar, was the case with Arjuna. He
did not want to fight, because his kith and kin would be killed.

He declared, in the thirty-third verse of the first chapter, ""Those __
for whose sake we desire kingdom, enjoyments and pleasures,
stand here in battle, renouncing their lives and riches."" It shows, _
that Arjuna desired kingdom, enjoyment and pleasure and so he
did not know about his previous births.

Accumulation of materials, such as riches etc., for enjoyment
and pleasure, 1s called 'parigraha’. When a person, totally renounces
this tendency for accumulation, he develops an intuition, which
enables him to know of previous births (Patafyala yogadarSana 2/39).

The world, actions and objects are changing and unreal. So it
naturally suffers deficiency, while the self has no such shortage,
at all. But when he assumes his affinity for the world, he feels
shortcoming in him and wants to make these up, by having desires.

In order to satisfy those desires, he remains absorbed in different

activities day and night but desires are never to be satiated. Due

to desires man acts as if he is unconscious. Not to speak of the

knowledge of several births, he does not even know his duty,

of the present i.e., what he should do and what he is doing.

3. (a) Those who know Him as the Lord of all beings.

Yogamiaya, (the divine potency), these two pertaining to His |
power, and the sixth one, is His manifestation.]

'‘Ajo'pi sannavyayatma'—The Lord, by this expression, explains
that, unlike common men, He is without birth and death. People
take birth and die, but He in spite of being birthless, manifests
Himself, and in spite of being imperishable, conceals Himself. Both
manifestation and concealment, are his unearthly sport (pastimes).

All beings were unmanifest before birth, and will be unmanifest, :
after death, these are manifest only in the middle (Gita 2/28)
while the Lord, ever remains revealed like the sun. As the sun, rs
before rising and after setting, remains the same, but it 1s not seen
by all the beings all the time; so is the case with God Who ever
remains revealed, but seems to be manifested and concealed.

Other beings, have to take birth under the subordination of _
nature (prakrti), according to the actions of the past, while God
manifests Himself of His own accord. Beings, take birth grow,
become old and die, moreover, they have to undergo pleasure -
and pain. But, that is not so in the case of God. He does not
undergo any change. He incarnates Himself, as Lord Rama or -
Krsna etc., displays His sports as a child, and an adolescent and

then continues to be an adolescent with a healthy and handsome
body, without undergoing any change for hundreds of years. |
Therefore, picture of God, are prepared without a beard and
moustache, (if a modern artist shows them, that is something
different). Thus, unlike other men, God is neither born, nor does
He, undergo any modifications, nor does He die.

'Bhitanamisvaro'pi san'—In spite of, being the only Lord
(great Lord) of all beings, God becomes a child, when He
incarnates Himself. But even then, He possesses His Lordly
nature—as Lord Krsna killed an ogress named Putana, of a
very huge and horrible body, when He was only six days old.

He killed the demons—Sakata, Trnavarta and Agha respectively,
when He was three months old, one year old and five years old
"
502,"Verse 6] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 461 .
respectively. Thus, in His childhood, He killed several demons. ,
He raised the Govardhana mountain, on the tip of His finger,

when He was only seven years old.

In spite of being the Lord of all beings, when He manifests |
Himself, He does not hesitate even to perform, the most menial :
job. This is His divine superiority. He works, as a chariot-driver
of Arjuna, and obeys him, yet His Lordliness, over Arjuna and |
other beings remains intact. That is why, in spite of being a -
charioteer, He preaches him, the gospel of the Gita. Lord Rama
carries out the order of His father, DaSaratha and goes into exile Bo
for fourteen years, yet His Lordliness over DaSaratha and other
beings, has not suffered, in the least.

'Prakrtim svamadhisthaya'— The Lord's pure nature (prakiti)
is different, from the three modes of nature—of goodness, of
passion and of ignorance. This pure nature, is His divine potency, — -
transcendental power, or delighting power. It is the embodiment of
truth, consciousness and bliss. It is, also called the sentient power
or power of grace. The same divine or transcendental power is
known as Sri Radha* or Sri Sita. It is, also called ‘devotion’ or
the supreme knowledge, by which God 1s attained. ;

Prakrti (nature), is the Lord's power, which is neither different
from God nor is one with Him. For example, fire has two kinds
of power, of lighting and burning. The first, removes darkness
as well as fear, while the latter, is used for cooking and heating
purposes. But, both these powers are neither different from fire,
as these are nothing but fire, nor are they one with fire, because
they can be subdued by sacred formulas, and herbs etc. :

As, the lighting and the burning powers of fire, remain innate

* The Lord manifests Himself with His pure nature (Prakrti) 1.e., His trans-
cendental power which works for Him. Sri Radha is His divine power and she
has several female friends who are the embodiments of devotion and they bestow
devotion upon His devotees. A person devoid of devotion can’t know them. A
devotee can know them only by the grace of Lord Krsna and $i Radha.
"
503,"462 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA © [Chapter4—-
in a match-box, so does God's power remain unexposed even _
though He pervades everywhere, all the time, in all things and
persons etc. The Lord, manifests Himself by keeping His nature
(prakrti) under control. As fire is not seen, until it is revealed
with its lighting and burning power, so is the Lord not beheld °
until He manifests Himself with His transcendental power, even
_ though He pervades everywhere all the time.

Sri Radha, Sri Sita and Sri Rukmini etc., are the Lord's -
own divine powers. He pervades everywhere universally, yet
He does not perform, any activity. Whatever He does, He -—.... ....
does with His divine power. The drama, that He stages with
His divine power, is so wonderful and uncommon, that human
beings having heard, sung and recollected it, are sanctified and
they attain salvation.

The same divine power, in the case of devotees, who are the -
worshippers of the attributeless aspect of the Absolute, becomes
the supreme knowledge of Brahma; while for devotees who 7
worship the Lord endowed with attributes, that power becomes
devotion. When a devotee has an exclusive devotion for God,

His divine power is revealed in him, in the form of his devotion. :
This devotion is so singular, that it attracts God and He in spite

of being formless, has to reveal Himself, endowed with that, |
form. This devotion, is also bestowed upon devotees by Him.

The divine power of God, in the form of devotion, is
perceived in two ways—disunion and union. It is by God's
grace, that there is disunion of a devotee from God, because in
that state, he becomes so much restless to meet Him, that his
attachment to the world is totally renounced and God manifests
Himself. In the Discipline of Knowledge, the divine power of
God is revealed in the form of keen desire to know. This keen
curiosity to know, compels a striver to know the real Essence.

Then, in the form of the supreme knowledge of Brahma, it roots
out ignorance and illumines the real self. But the divine power
"
504,"Verse 6] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 463 -
of disunion, is more powerful even than this. 'Where is God?’ |
‘What should I do to attain Him?' ""Where should I go?’ When
a devotee becomes restless, to attain Him, his restlessness roots
out all his sins, and reveals Him to him. This restlessness, is
a better means of God-realization, than knowledge. (wisdom or .
discrimination).
|
The Lord, manifests Himself by keeping His nature (prakrti)
under control, and stages, the drama of human life. As fire by oo enn
itself, does nothing, its lighting power provides light and its
burning power, burns things, so the Lord does nothing, but it is
His divine power, which does everything. In the scripture Sita.
declares, ‘It is I, who killed Ravana and other demons, while
Lord Rama did nothing’. | -
Like man and his power, God and His power, are neither
different from each other, nor are one. God cannot separate His -
power from Him; so it is not different from Him. A man remains
the same, but his power changes so it is not identical with him. -
Therefore, philosophers have called it, neither different nor one.
This power is indescribable. The devotees of Lord Krsna call
that power as Sriji (Radhaji). |
As a male and a female are two distinct entities, that way
Lord Krsna and Radhaji are not two. Lord Krsna and His power,
Radhaji in the Discipline of Knowledge become one, while, in
the Discipline of Devotion become two, Lord Krsna and Radhaji
become two*, so that they may stage the drama of human life,
in order to exchange love and thrill the devotees with delight.
When they become two, it is difficult to judge, who is superior,
and who the lover and who the beloved. Both of them, appear
*Lord Krsna and Radha are the oceans of savour, they are one
but they have become two in order to stage the drama of human life

uncommon and unique and they are attracted towards each other.
They are pleased by seeing each other. Their pastime of love,
for each other is enhanced. This is called ‘Rasa’ (sport). |

The Lord's powers. are infinite and limitless. His powers

can be classified into two groups, pertaining to glory and those

_ pertaining to sweetness or love. By His majestic power, He does
wonderful sports and feats, which none else can do. By this very
power, we find in Him excellence, eminence, singularity and ~
divinity which are neither heard nor seen anywhere else. While
He exercises His sweet power, He Himself is overwhelmed, and ae
forgets that He is Lord. When He manifests Himself in a sweet
mood, He appears to be very sweet and loving. He plays, with
cowherds like an ordinary cowherd. Similarly, He plays the role
of a friend, a son and a husband and so on, in the drama of life.
Thus He thrills His devotees with delight, with His sweetness -
and love, by not disclosing His glory and grandeur.

The Lord, reveals one of His powers at a time, either that of -
glory or that of sweetness. When any doubt arises in the sentiment
of sweetness, His power or glory is revealed. Lord Krsna as -
a cowherd, searches for calves. But, when doubt arises, about
their whereabout, His power is revealed and He immediately
comes to know, that the cows have been taken away by Brahma,
the creator.

The Lord is also the handsomest, so every being is naturally
attracted towards Him. Seeing His beauty, the women of Mathura |
say to each other— |

""Lord Krsna is the quintessence of handsomeness, no one can
compete with Him in the entire universe, He is handsome, even
without any outward make up, or ornamentation. No one is ever
satisfied by seeing His countenance, because His charm ever
remains fresh. All kinds of fame, beauty and glory, depend upon
His handsome appearance. It is very rare to behold Him. What
penances the cowherdesses must have performed so that they
"
506,"Verse 6] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 465
ever beheld His sweet countenance"" (Srimadbha. 10/44/14)?
Sn Sukadevaji says:—""O Pariksit! All the citizens of
Mathura and other people of the country, who were sitting on
the dais, having seen Lord Krsna and Balarama, were so much
pleased that their eyes and faces were glowing and filled with |
curiosity. They were not satisfied by looking at their handsome
faces through their eyes and it seemed as if they were imbibing
them with their eyes, licking them (with their tongues), smelling -
them (with their noses) and embracing them to their chests""
(Srimadbha. 10/43/20-21). So
Having seen the beauty of Lord Rama, king Janaka was
filled with joy and declared that his dispassionate mind, having
seen the sweet and handsome face of Lord Rama, was so much
enamoured as a 'Cakora’ (the Indian red-legged partridge) is, by
the moon (Manasa 1/216/2). a 7
Even the wild tribes, such as Kola and Bhila got |
enamoured of Lord Rama's countenance. They salute _
Lord Rama, offer their presents to Him, behold Him, with
great affection. They are so much enamoured of Him that
they remain standing there just like statues. Their bodies ;
are thrilled and their eyes are flooded with tears of love
(Manasa 2/135/3).
Not to talk of the Lord's devotees, even demons, such as
Khara-Dusana who have enmity with Lord Rama, are wonder-
struck with His charm. So they say:—Out of all the snakes,
demons, gods, men and ascetics, whom we have seen, conquered
and killed throughout our life, we have never seen such. beauty
(Manasa 3/19/2).
'Sarnbhavamyatmamayaya'—The Lord, does not reveal
Himself, to those who have a disinclination for Him, and
He appears to them, as a common man. ‘He stages a drama
of His human life, by keeping His divine potency concealed’
(Srimadbhagavata 10/29/1).
"
507,"466 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4

A devotee comes to know God, while a non-believer does |
not know Him. The more a devotee is inclined towards Him,
the more He reveals Himself to him.

Deluded people cannot know Him, because of their delusion
and because of the divine potency of the Lord (Gita 7/25). .
They cannot understand the infinitude of God, even when He
manifests Himself before them just as He manifested Himself
in the form of Draupadi's unending saree. Yet because of their -
delusion Duhsasana, Duryodhana. and Karna etc., could not know,

His manifestation. —

If a person gets rid of his delusion, he can realize the self
or God, but cannot behold Him.*

One can have a vision of the Lord, only when He unveils
Himself, by removing the veil of His divine potency. A man can _
get rid of this own delusion, but it is beyond his power to do
away with God's divine potency. If a person takes refuge in Him,

He removes his delusion and also helps him, to behold Him. -

The different plays, that the Lord stages, are accomplished
with the help of His divine potency. So people can see those plays :

no one can, elther see these, or relish these.

upholds, infinite universes yet He is known as 'Giradhari,' because
he lifted a mountain, 'Govardhana’. It is nothing surprising in

uphold a mountain. But, it is His peculiarity, in upholding it, as ©

innocent boy. While playing, He was defeated by other cowherds,
consequently, He had to carry the victor on His back. -
The. wise, remain absorbed in the self, but His devotees
relish His pastimes. Even Brahma, the leader of the wise, was Se
wonder-struck by beholding His pastimes, and so are the great
saints and ascetics who cannot understand the secret of His play
and remain dumb-founded. The Lord by His grace, enables those
devotees, who are exclusively devoted to Him, to know the secret
of His pastimes (Manasa 2/127/2). Lord Krsna while grazing -
cows, kills huge bodied demons, in no time. Despite being a |
boy, His Lordliness remains the same as usual. _
As a learned teacher, utters the letters 'a’ 'b’ 'c' etc., while
teaching the alphabet to a boy by descending to the boy's standard;
so does the Lord of infinite universes, preach the gospel to us, by -
becoming one of us, His wonderful and unearthly pastimes, lead
people to salvation, whether they listen to them, study or sing them.
Appendix—The Lord carries on His pastime with the help of
Prakrti. Therefore Sitaji declares, “I have performed all the deeds,
Lord Rama has done nothing (Adhyatma Ramayana, Balaka.
1/32—43). But like the man the Lord is not subordinated to
Prakrti—‘prakrtith svamadhisthaya’. The reason is that for the
Lord Prakrti is not different from Him but is identical with
Him (Gita 7/4-5). The Lord has to manifest Himself before
the man who is seated in Prakrti, therefore He reveals Himself
by subordinating His Prakrti (nature). Then only men can
behold Him.

abhyutthanamadharmasya tadatmanam srjamyaham
Whenever, there is a decline in righteousness and an upsurge -
in unrighteousness, O Arjuna, I then manifest Myself. 7
Comment:— | | |
""Yada yada hi dharmasya glanirbhavati bharata abhyutthanam-
adharmasya'—When righteous, innocent, weak, pious and spiritual
people, are exploited by unrighteous, cmel, strong, wicked and
- mundane people, and when moral values are lost and immorality -
prevails—that state, is the state of a decline of nghteousness,
and upsurge of unrighteousness. -
The terms ""Yada yada’ (whenever) show, that God manifests
Himself, whenever there is need for His manifestation. -
Example—when the seas were churned, God in the form of
unconquered Lord Visnu, churned the seas as a divine Tortoise,
held Mandaracala (mountain), pressed it hard, as a being with a |
thousand arms, and as a bewitching woman distributed the nectar
among the gods. Thus, God manifested Himself, in different
forms, at the same time.
The root, of the decline of righteousness and the rise of
unrighteousness, is its attraction towards the perishable. As the
body of a child, is inherited from the parents’ bodies, so, is
the universe created, by nature (prakrti) and God. Out of these,
(nature and its evolute), the world ever-undergo modifications,
while God and His fragment, the soul, ever remain uniform,
without the least modification. When a man, has a desire to
derive pleasure out of mundane objects, he starts having a fall.
"
510,"Verse 7] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 469 |
The more he is attached to worldly pleasures and prosperity,

the more increase there is, in unrighteousness. The more this
unrighteousness rises, the more vices, such as sins, strifes and

riots etc., prevail, in the society. | |

There is a decline of righteousness through the Satya age,
to Treta, Dvapara and Kali ages, respectively. In the Satya
age righteousness flourishes. In Treta, the decline begins, in
Dvapara there is a rapid decline and in Kali age, unrighteousness -
prevails. Then, God manifests Himself, for the establishment of
righteousness.

'Tadatmanam srjamyaham'—Whenever, there is a decline - oe
of righteousness and rise of ‘unrighteousness, then the Lord ~
manifests Himself for the destruction of unrighteousness and
for the establishment of righteousness.

When there is a decline of righteousness and increase in -
unrighteousness, people are inclined to unrighteousness, which
leads them to a downfall. The Lord, is the disinterested friend of
all beings, so He manifests Himself, 1n order to check their fall. -
_ When actions are performed with a selfish motive i.e., for
reward, there is a decline of righteousness; and when a man, °
having deviated from his duty performs forbidden actions, there
is rise of unrighteousness. It 1s desire, which is the root of all
unrighteousness, sins and injustice etc., (Gita 3/37). Therefore,

God manifests Himself, in order to root out this desire and
propagate the principle of the performance of actions, without
expectation of any reward. |

Here, a doubt may arise why at the present, in the wretched
Kali age, God does not manifest Himself, when there is such
a decline of righteousness and rise of unrighteousness. The
clarification is, that the time 1s not yet ripe. During the Treta
age, the demons having killed many sages, piled up their bones.

But, at present righteous persons are leading a pious and peaceful
life, and nobody kills them. Secondly, when there is decline of
"
511,"470 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4 .
righteousness and rise of unrighteousness, by God's direction saints
come to earth or true strivers reveal themselves; these establish
righteousness. Sometimes, the liberated souls: living in divine
abode also come to earth, to help the people to attain salvation,
as representatives of. God. Where, there are such strivers and
saints, there is, neither so much decline of righteousness, nor
so much increase in unrighteousness, as at other places where
_ there are, neither strivers nor saints. | -
When people do not follow the teachings of strivers and
saints, but start to kill them, and when there are left, only a - |
few righteous persons to propagate righteousness, and there is a
_ decline in righteousness, then God manifests Himself.

Comment:—
'Paritranaya sadhtinam'—God manifests Himself, in order
to protect the good, because they destroy unrighteousness and
propagate righteousness.
‘The term, 'sadhunam’' (of Sadhus) has been used for those
good men, who naturally are inclined towards the good of others,
who remember and chant the name, and think of form, qualities,
"
512,"Verse 8] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI AT]
glories and pastimes etc., of God, who propagate these among
people and who depend on God.

He, whose only aim is God-realization, is a good person (sage)
while one who hankers after worldly pleasures and prosperity, |
is not a good person. -

When a man, attaches importance to the perishable world,
desires are born. As desires increase, goodness disappears, but
when desires are renounced, goodness appears. Because, desire oF
is the root of evil. Goodness leads to salvation of one's self and |
to the welfare of others. _ a

Good people, are even engrossed in the good of beasts, birds,
trees, mountains, men, gods, manes and sages etc., through their
thoughts and deeds. In the Ramacaritamanasa the citizens of
Ayodhya say to Lord Rama, ""O foe of demons, in the world
there are only two, who do good to others, without any selfish -
motive, they are, You and Your devotees"" (7/47/3). :

If people come to know the thoughts and feelings of these -
Sadhus, they will ever bow to them. But if they know the |
thoughts and feelings of the wicked, there would be quarrels ;
and strifes. —

Here, a doubt may arise, why are such people seen .
suffering, when God protects them. The clarification is, that the |
Lord protects their good feelings, rather than their bodies, riches,
honour and fame etc. The reason is, that those good people -
do not attach importance to the mundane objects, because by
doing so, they may turn bad. The Lord also, would not attach
importance to them.

Devotees truly never desire, worldly objects. They are happy
in unfavourable circumstances, because these lead them to spiritual
upliftment. Devotion, develops in unfavourable circumstances,
because their attachment, which causes their downfall, is renounced. |
Therefore, the Lord protects the good, by creating unfavourable |
circumstances for them.

'Vinasaya ca duskrtam'—The wicked, propagate unrighteous- __
ness and destroy righteousness. So the Lord manifests Himself,
for their destruction. | os |

Those who, because of many desires, remain absorbed in
vices, such as falsehood, fraud, deception and dishonesty etc. __
Those who exploit the virtuous and good persons; those who
remain engaged in doing evil to others; those who do not know
what ought to be done and what ought not to be done; and those, _~
who always condemn God and the scriptures, such persons, of
demoniac nature, have been called wicked. The Lord manifests -
Himself for the destruction of such wicked persons.

Question:—The Lord declares, that He is the same to all
beings and there is none hateful, to Him (Gita 9/29); then why
does He destroy the wicked? a | |

Answer:—As the Lord is a disinterested friend of all beings, no
one is hateful to Him. But he who is an enemy of His devotees,
is also His enemy. In the Ramacaritamanasa, it is said, ""He who ~~
offends a devotee of Lord Rama, has to burn in the Lord's fire
of anger"" (2/218/2-3).

God is called, a devotee of His devotees: (Srimadbhagavata
10/86/59). So the wicked, who offend His devotees, are destroyed
by Him. Devotees, destroy sins while God destroys sinners. |

As His grace is revealed in protecting the good, so is His
grace revealed in destroying the wicked as He does evil to none
(2/183/3). Moreover, He purifies them by destroying them.

Saints also establish righteousness but they do not destroy the
wicked. Destruction of the wicked is brought about by the Lord in
the same way, as a simple injury may be dressed by a compounder
but a major operation is performed only by a civil surgeon.

Both the parents are equally interested in the welfare of
their son. When the son does not pay attention to his studies,
and indulges in mischief, both of them want to set him right.

The father beats him, so that he may give up his bad habit. The
"
514,"Verse 8] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 473
mother, checks the father from beating him: Being faithful, it is 7
her duty to follow her husband's footsteps. So should she also
start beating the boy, because she is faithful? No, it is her duty
to protect the boy, otherwise he may receive a severe beating. :
The father, also does not want to give him a good beating, but :
he wants the son to get rid of his bad habit. Similarly, God is
like a father, while saints are like a mother. First, the Lord and
saints urge people to give up their wickedness, but when they .
do not mend their ways, God has to manifest Himself for their
destruction. If they give up their wickedness, there is no need
to destroy them. | |
The attributeless Absolute, is not antagonistic to nature,
illusion and ignorance, it rather, gives existence inspires and
nourishes these. God, whether He is attributeless or is endowed
with attributes, fosters all beings, equally without any distinction. -
Even the earth, created by Him, provides room equally to everyone, |
whether he is virtuous or wicked. Similarly, all of them are
equally provided with the necessities of life, such as food, water, ;
air and sunlight. Thus the Lord is an ocean of generosity and
equanimity, even to the vilest person. If a person just thinks of His -
generosity, he gets thrilled with delight and starts bowing to Him.
The Lord, is not opposed to wicked person, but He is
opposed to their wicked actions as those actions are injurious,
to the world, as well as to them. The Lord is a disinterested
friend of all beings. Therefore, He destroys the wicked, in order
to do good to the world, as well as to those wicked persons.
How generous He is, that having killed those wicked persons
He sends them to His own abode!
Now a question may arise, whether the Lord Himself will
have to come to kill us, if we go on committing sins. If it is as
so, we shall attain salvation easily, otherwise we shall have to
control our senses, mind etc., and inculcate virtues and practise
spiritual discipline. The answer is, that the Lord destroys only
"
515,"474 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4 _ -
those wicked who cannot be destroyed by anyone, else. Secondly,
performance of good actions will lead us to virtues, which would
pave the way to our salvation. But if we are killed by anyone
else, or die a natural death while performing sinful actions, what
will be the consequences? How would our desire of being killed ~
by the Lord, be fulfilled? Therefore, sinful actions, should not
be performed at all.

- ‘Dharmasamsthapanarthaya'—Establishment of righteousness,  ~-
consists in preaching and propagating the selfless performance |

| of actions. Unrighteousness propagates, due to the performance  — —~.———

of action with a selfish motive and due to the attachment to the
unreal. Therefore, the Lord manifests Himself, in order to propagate
the performance of selfless actions, through His deeds. When this
feeling is propagated, righteousness, is naturally established.

The Lord is the abode of righteousness (Gita 14/27). So He ©

_..manifests Himself, in order to establish righteousness well. In fact,
righteousness never perishes, it only declines. Whenever there isa
decline of righteousness, the Lord re-establishes it (Gita 4/1—3).
| -'Sambhavami yuge yuge'—The Lord, manifests Himself, from -
age to age. He also descends to the mortal world, several times
in the same age, according to the need of the hour. He incarnates
Himself as 'Karaka Purusas’, as well as saints. The incarnations |
of the Lord and His ‘Karaka Purusas' (representatives), are casual
or occasional, while saints are regularly born.

Now, a doubt may arise, whether the omnipotent Lord cannot
protect the good, destroy the wicked, and establish righteousness
without manifesting Himself. The clarification is, that He can do
wonders without His manifestation also and go on doing so, yet
He manifests Himself in order to shower His special grace on
beings, for their welfare.* During His incarnation, His vision,

* The Lord manifests Himself as a human being in order to shower His
special grace on beings and He stages the drama of human life in such a manner
that it conduces them to be devoted to Him (Manasa 1/192).
"
516,"Verse 8] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 475 |
touch, talk etc., and later on, the practice of hearing, thinking,
chanting and following His sport, lead people to salvation.
The Lord, comes to the mortal world in different incarnations,
according to the need of the times. He remains perfect, during |
all the incarnations.
Though there is, nothing that should be done by Him, nor
is there anything unattained that should be attained (Gita 3/22),
yet He performs all actions by manifesting Himself, from time to
time, only for the welfare of the world. Therefore, human beings,
should also perform their duty, for the welfare of others. -
In response to Arjuna’s question which he put in the fourth
verse, the Lord explains the three main differences between men's
births and His births (manifestations):— |
(1) Difference in knowledge:—Many births of men, as well ~
as of the Lord, have taken place. Men do not know them all,
only the Lord knows. |
(2) Difference in birth:—Men have to take birth, under the
subordination of nature, (prakrti), in order to reap the fruits of
their virtuous and evil actions, and then to realize God. God
manifests Himself of His own accord, governing His nature
(prakrti) through His divine potency (4/6).
(3) Difference in actions:—Men perform actions, in order |
to satisfy their desires, though it is not the aim of human life,
while the Lord acts, only in order to enable beings to attain |
salvation (4/7-8).
Link:—In response to the question put, in the fourth verse,
by Arjuna, the Lord started describing the divine character of
His birth. Now in the next verse He, of His own accord, explains
the merit of knowing the divine character of His birth, as well as
actions, in order to explain the performance of actions without
expectation of fruit (Karmayoga).

Comment:— | |
‘Janma karma ca me divyam'— The Lord is beyond birth ~~~
and death, He is birthless and imperishable. His manifestation in
human body, is not like the birth of common men. He manifests
Himself of His own accord* in order to stage the drama of __
human life, for the welfare of beings. /
The form (body) of the Lord, unlike other beings, is not made
of flesh and blood. The bodies of beings are full of virtues and
vices. They are transitory, sick, mundane, changing, material and -
are born of ovum and semen, while the Form of the Lord, is free
frorn virtues and vices. It is eternal, healthy, spiritual, unchanging, —..
divine and is revealed. The bodies of gods, are also divine, but
_ the Form of the Lord, is far superior to those of the gods and
even the gods are ever eager to see this Form (Gita 11/52).
When the Lord descended on the mortal world, as Lord
Rama and Lord Krsna, mother Kausalya and Devaki, did
not give birth to Them. First, He revealed to them His four-
armed divine Form, with conch, disc, mace and lotus, and then
staged the drama of a child, then the mother, requested Him to
conceal that divine Form. The description has been, very clearly,
given, in the Ramacaritamanasa 1/192, as well as Srimadbhagavata
10/3/30 and 10/3/46.
* Uddhava tells Lord Krsna, ""You are the Supreme beyond Nature (Prakrti)
and You are Brahma, the very embodiment of knowledge; even then You have
manifested Yourself as a human being of Your ownaccord"" (Srimadbha. 11/1 1/28).
"
518,"Verse 9] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 477 :

When Lord Rama returned to His Abode, He, unlike common -
men, disappeared from this mortal world along with His body
(Form), His body was not left on the earth. It is said in the-
Ramayana by Valmiki, that having heard the words of Brahma,
the creator the very wise Lord Rama, having decided, entered the .
splendour of Lord Visnu, with His three brothers, in His Form. |
As far as Lord Krsna is concerned, the same fact, is mentioned
about Him in Srimadbhagavata that He also went to His Abode, -
in His Form (11/31/6)..

The same sort of description is available in Ramacaritamanasa,
when sage Valmiki says to Lord Rama, that His Form is divine Oo
and unaltered, only a deserving one knows the reality about Him,
when He manifests Himself as a human being, for protecting
saints and gods, and preach and act as a worldly king.

Once, sages Sanaka etc., were going to the Abode of Lord -
Visnu. The gatekeeper would not let them go in and they cursed
him. Knowing that His gatekeeper had insulted the sages, Lord
Visnu Himself came to the entrance. Having a vision of the -
Lord, and receiving the divine smell of basil leaves and shoots,
while bowing to Him, their bodies and hearts were thrilled, and ~
excited, though such wise sages, ever remain established in the
imperishable Lord (Srimadbha. 3/15/43). As the smell of the
Lord's lotus feet, is divine, His clothes, ornaments and weapons |
etc., are also divine, sentient and very singular.

Having heard, studied and recollected the pastime of the Lord,
people's hearts are purified and they get rid of ignorance—this
is the divine nature of His actions. Lord Sankara, Brahma, the
creator, sages, such as Sanaka etc., divine sage, Narada etc., who
are the embodiments of knowledge, having sung and heard of
His divine pastime, get absorbed in them. A person who visits
the places, where the Lord staged the drama of His human life,
with reverence and faith and resides there, attains salvation. It
means that the Lord manifests Himself and carries on His pastimes
"
519,"478 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA _ [Chapter4  -
in order to enable the people to attain salvation. Therefore, |
people attain their aim by reading, hearing and thinking, of His
divine pastimes. | :

In the fourth verse, Arjuna put the question to the Lord
pertaining to His birth, but here, the Lord starts describing his -
action of his own accord. By doing so, it seems as if the Lord |
wants to emphasize the fact, that a man's actions can also be
divine, though his birth cannot be divine as human life has been -
bestowed upon him only to perform, such actions. Actions are |
divine, when these are free from desire, for reward, attachment So
and a sense of 'mine.' Divine actions, lead to liberation from
the bondage, of the present as well as past actions, and these
naturally do good to others.

In fact, actions become impure, when a man. accepts his
affinity for perishable objects; and these lead him to bondage. -
This affinity, makes not only actions but also objects and mind,
impure. As soon as, this affinity is renounced, all the three become
pure. It is affinity for the perishable, which is the main obstacle
to salvation. , |

| 'Evar yo vetti tattvatah'—God in spite of, being without, :
birth imperishable and the Lord of all beings, manifests Himself,

of His own accord, and by keeping His nature (prakrti) under
control, for the welfare of all beings. He who knows this fact, |
realises the divine nature, of the births of the Lord.

Though all actions are performed by Him, yet He is a non- -
doer i.e., He has no pride of doership (Gita 4/13), nor does He
desire, the fruit of actions (Gita 4/14). He who knows fact,
knows the divine nature of the Lord's actions.

As the Lord manifests Himself, for the welfare of the entire __
creation and as He remains detached from actions, similarly,
those people, who live for the welfare of the world, and remain
detached from actions, know the divine nature of His births
(manifestations) and actions.
"
520,"Verse 9] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 479
'Tyaktva deham punarjanma naiti'—There is nothing in the |
thee worlds, that is to be done by the Lord, nor is there anything
unattained, that should be attained by Him (Gita 3/22), yet He
manifests Himself in this mortal world, by His grace to inspire -
beings to attain salvation. He carries on His wonderful pastime, |
also for the same purpose. When a person recites, hears, reads or
thinks of his pastimes, he is linked with the Lord. When he ts .
connected with the Lord his tie with the world is cut off. When
this bond with the world is snapped, he is not reborn i.e., he is
liberated, from the bondage of birth and death. OO
In fact, it is not action but desire, which binds a man and
this desire is man-made. In order to satisfy his desire, he performs
actions with a selfish motive, being attached to these, they bind ,
him. As desire is enhanced, he is inclined towards sinful actions, 7
which lead him to his birth, in evil bodies and to hell. But, when
he performs actions without a selfish motive for the welfare of
others, his actions become divine and uncommon, they do not
lead him to bondage and _ he is not reborn.
‘Mameti so'rjuna'—When a man assumes his affinity for ”
perishable actions, the ever-attainable Lord, seems unattained,
to him. But, when actions are performed without expecting any
reward, for the welfare of others, their direction is towards the .
world and the ever-attained Lord, is realized.
It is because of the Lord's divine nature, that He descends
to this mortal world, in order to shower His grace upon beings.
Those who know this fact, become His devotees and then remain
absorbed only in His adoration or devotion (Manasa 5/34/2).
This devotion, leads to salvation. Similarly, when a man knows
the divine nature of His actions then his actions also become
divine viz., pure and then these lead him, as well as others,
to God-realization (salvation) as he renounces his affinity for
the world. It is the affinity, which is an obstacle to salvation
or God-realization.
"
521,"480 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA | [Chapter 4
. Actions. are transitory and perishable, and so is their fruit,
while the self (soul) 1s uniform and eternal. Therefore, in fact the -
self has no affinity for actions, the affinity is merely assumed. |
While performing actions, if a man realizes that he has no affinity
for them, his actions become divine. This is the reality, about /
actions and this is Karmayoga. | |
When a man identifies himself, with active nature (prakrti), ee
it gives an impetus to action. He can never remain even for a
moment, without performing action (Gita 3/5). He thinks, that as
worldly objects are acquired by performing actions, so can the
Lord be realized through them. But, it is an error of judgement,
because only perishable objects, rather than the imperishable, Lord, -
can be acquired through perishable actions. The imperishable |
Lord, can be attained by renouncing affinity for actions. This
affinity for action can be renounced more easily, through the 7
Discipline of Action, than through the Discipline of knowledge.
It is so because when.all action with gross, subtle and causal -
bodies is performed, for the welfare of the world without any
selfish motive, their flow is towards the world, and so affinity |
for action is renounced. .
- The Lord, by using the terms 'Mameti' wants to explain,
that He whom, a man wants to attain through the performance
of actions is éver attained. What efforts are required to attain
Him who is ever attained and ever-existent? Whatever was not
otherwise attained is attained, by effort? _
Two aspects are noteworthy in this regard—origin and
discovery. Originated, is that which has no independent, existence,
and which was absent in the beginning and perishes in the end.
Discovered, is that which has a separate existence forever. But
God seems to get concealed, when importance is attached to
mundane actions and objects. When one uses actions and objects
"
522,"Verse 9] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI | 481 .
in rendering service to others, his affinity for actions and objects :
is automatically renounced and ever attainable God is revealed.

_ This is called discovery of the ever attained.

Carelessness and indolence, in the performance of actions |
and the desire for fruit of actions are the main stumbling blocks -
to God-realization. If actions are performed without the desire
for fruit in rendering service to others, the affinity for actions
is renounced and we realize our affinity: for God which is -
naturally eternal. . : :

Appendix—lIf actions are performed for the welfare of others eee
in a disinterested way or they are performed for the Lord’s sake,
those actions become divine and lead to’ salvation. But the actions
performed ridden with desire for one’s own self become impure
and lead to bondage. — |

Actions done without the sense of doership are of divine -
character. When ‘actions are not performed for one’s own self,
the sense of doership is wiped out. | -

The Lord’s most insignificant action as well as the most
significant action is His ‘pastime’. In His pastime the Lord ;
while acting like common men remains untainted (Gita 4/13).

The Lord’s drama of life is divine. This divine nature of His
drama is singular and is different from the divine nature of gods. |
The divine nature of gods in comparison with men is relatively
divine and is limited while the Lord’s divinity is absolute and
infinite. Though the actions of liberated, enlightened and God-
loving exalted souls are also divine but they are not like the
Lord’s pastimes. Even the common pastime of the Lord is very
uncommon (unworldly). As the Lord’s ‘Rasalila’ seems worldly yet
by reading it and by listening to it, a striver’s lust (sex) is wiped
out (Srimadbhi. tenth canto, thirty-third chapter, fortieth verse).

This world is the beginningless incarnation of God—
‘adyo’vatarah purusah parasya’ (Srimadbha. 2/6/41). It means
that God has manifested Himself in the form of the world.
"
523,"482 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4 -
But the embodied soul, because of his attachment to pleasures |
without recognising it as the manifestation of God, has sustained
it as the world—‘jivabhitarn mahabaho yayedam dharyate jagat’ .
(Gita 7/5). In order to wipe out this notion, a striver should firmly
believe that whatever is perceived (seen) is the manifestation of . -
God and whatever is happening is the pastime of the Lord. By
assuming (accepting) this, the world will not remain as the world
and ‘there is nothing except God’—this truth will be realized. In
other words the world will disappear and only God will remain.
The reason is that by thinking (accepting) everything and person ee
as the manifestation of God and every action as the Lord’s
pastime, attraction for pleasure and also attachment—aversion
will not persist. When attachment to pleasure is wiped out the
actions which seemed worldly, will appear divine as the pastime
of the Lord and the attachment to pleasure will be transformed -
into love (devotion) for God.
The Lord carries on this pastime according to the Form in -
which He manifests Himself.* When He takes the form of an

us, we regard these as of others and for others, and render service -
to others with these, attachment perishes because in fact, we
have no affinity for such objects and actions.
The Lord, without any selfish motive descends to the
mortal world, in order to inspire beings to attain salvation, as :
He is a disinterested friend, of all beings. When a man has
a firm belief that He is the disinterested friend of all beings,
he is attracted towards God. The attraction for Him wipes out -
attraction, (attachment) for the world. For example, in childhood
children play the game of marbles and have attraction for the a
same. They ever quarrel for their possessions. But, when they
grow old, instead of having attraction for marbles or toys they
have attraction for money. But, when they are inclined towards
God, they have no attraction for mundane objects and riches
etc. Their attachment for them, is renounced. As soon as it is -
renounced, fear and anger are rooted out, because both of these
depend on attachment. 7
""Manmaya'—When, a man knows the truth about the divine
nature of the Lord's birth and actions, He becomes, dear to him. -
So he takes refuge in Him, and gets absorbed in Him. |
Those, who have attraction for mundane pleasures get
absorbed in the desire for pleasure (Gita 2/43), while those, who ,
have attraction for God ever remain absorbed in Him (Narada-
Bhaktisutra 70). They lose their individuality, because of their
exclusive devotion to Him, and identify themselves with Him.*
‘Mamupasritah'—The expression, 'Vitaragabhayakrodhah’
denotes, total severance of connection with the world, while it also
indicates that a striver taking refuge in Him, gets absorbed in Him.
* Cowherdesses became just like their loving Lord Krsna in gait and
manners, laughter and merriment, glance, speech, inclination and facialexpression
etc. They having forgotten themselves totally became the embodiment of Lord
Krsna and copying His pastime began to utter,""I am no one else but Lord Krsna

world as Rama and Krsna etc., and also as a fish and a tortoise
etc. He carried on His pastime according to His Form. As in
‘varahavatara’ (incarnation as a boar) he played the drama as a
boar and in ‘Vamanavatara’ (incarnation as a dwarf) he carried |
on the pastime as a celibate. Therefore a striver should hold that .

Comment:—
'Vitardgabhayakrodhah'—When a man, has disinclination for
God, he gets attached to the perishable objects. It is, because of
his attachment, that he has the sense of 'mine,' for the objects
acquired and a desire for those unacquired. He has greed for the
acquired objects and gets angry with those who are obstacles to
the acquisition of those objects. If persons, who are obstacles, are
stronger than him, it causes fear. Thus, attachment to perishable
objects gives birth to fear, anger, greed, desire and feeling of
‘mine,’ and such other vices. If attachment is renounced, all these
vices perish. If instead of regarding the objects as ours and for
"
526,"Verse 10] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 485 -
A man has to depend upon something or the other in this |
world. He (the soul).in spite of being a fragment of God, having
no inclination for Him, relies on perishable objects, such as riches
etc., which lead to his downfall. Not only this, but even if he
depends, on intellect, in order to perform virtuous actions, on -
the practice of spiritual discipline or on renunciation of pleasure
and prosperity, he cannot realize God, quickly. So long as, he
(the self) does not depend on God, his dependence on world .
does not end, and he has to suffer pain.
A man, 1s attracted towards loving persons and objects, such mete wien
as his wife and son etc., while he, depends on his superiors,
such as parents and elders etc. But a devotee of the Lord, has
attraction for Him and also depends on Him, because for him,
He is most loving and superior to all. |
'Bahavo jiianatapasa pita madbhavamagatah'—Though a man, 7
is purified through the Discipline of Knowledge also, yet the
term ‘Jnana’ (knowledge), has been used, for knowing the reality -
about the divine nature of the Lord's birth and action. This
knowledge, purifies the man, because the Lord is the purest of
the pure. The soul being a fragment of God, is naturally pure. :
In the Manasa it is declared, ""The soul is sentient, pure and
naturally, a heap of joy"" (7/117/1). By attaching importance to
the perishable and by having the feeling of ‘mine’ with them,
he (the soul) becomes impure. When a man knows reality about
the divine birth and divine actions of God, his attraction for the
perishable and his feeling of 'mine’ for them, totally perish and
then all impurity comes to an end, and he emerges very pure.
This is Karmayoga. So the term, ‘Jnana’ can stand for
knowledge of Karmayoga, in which all acquired things, such
as the body, senses, mind, intellect, rank, ability, authority, riches
and property etc., are not one’s own or for one's own self, but
are of the world and for the world. Why? The reason is, that he
(the self) is eternal; so how can perishable things stay with the
"
527,"486 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4
imperishable soul, and be useful for It? Perishable things, such as |
the body etc., were neither with us before, nor will remain with
us after death, and at present also, they are being destroyed every
moment. We have a right, to make proper use of acquired objects,
rather than to lay claim to them. These things (objects), belong “
to the world and so they should be used in rendering service to
the world; this is their proper use. But if anyone regards these
as his, or for him, it is a bondage or impurity for him. -

When a person, does not regard perishable things, as his or
for him, it means that he performs the penance of knowledge, orn oe
which purifies him. The penance of knowledge, is superior to
all other austerities. Through this, the assumed affinity for the
insentient (matter), is renounced totally. So long as, a man assumes |
his affinity for the insentient, he is not so easily purified by -
any other penance, as he is purified by that knowledge, through
which, his affinity for matter is renounced. Being purified, by
the penance of knowledge, a man attains to His Being, which -
is Truth, Consciousness and Bliss. It means, that as the Lord is
eternal, he also resides in Him constantly; as the Lord is untainted .
and unaffected he also remains untainted and unaffected. As
nothing remains to be done by God, nothing further remains to
be done by him. A man, through the Discipline of Knowledge, .
also attains to His Being (Gita 14/19).

Many devotees, having been purified by the penance of
knowledge, have attained Him. So strivers at present, also
being purified by the penance of knowledge, should attain Him.
Everyone, is independent in attaining Him, because this human |
body has been bestowed upon them, only to. attain God.

how they attain Him. The Lord answers the question, in the

O Partha! However, the way devotees worship Me, so do

I approach them; for all men ultimately follow My path. 11

Comment:— : -
""Ye yatha mam prapadyante tamstathaiva bhajamyaham'— —

Howsoever, devotees seek God, so does He meet them, and grant oe

them their hearts’ desires. He reveals Himself, to a devotee, in

the same form in which he thinks of Him. If a devotee thinks

of Him, as his preceptor, He becomes an excellent preceptor.

Similarly, God becomes a worthy father or mother, son, brother,

friend or even, an obedient servant, according to the desire of -

the devotee. If a devotee, feels restless without God, He also

becomes restless without, His devotee. -
Arjuna regarded Lord Krsna, as his friend and wanted to

make Him his chariot-driver. Therefore, He became his chariot-

driver. Sage VisSvamitra, treated Him as a disciple; so He became

his disciple. Therefore, with whatever sentiment devotees seek

Him, He correlates, by the same sentiment. The Lord of infinite |

worlds, reciprocates to the sentiments of His own created common

beings. How generous affectionate and merciful He is!

This topic reveals, that the Lord manifests Himself for the |
sake of His devotees. He descends to the earth, according to

the sentiment of His devotees. It is mentioned in the Upanisad,

'The Lord felt lonely’ (Brhadaranyaka 1/4/3). So He manifested

Himself in different forms and started His sport. Similarly,

when devotees have a desire to take part in divine sport in the

company of the Lord, He manifests Himself, in order to take

part. When a devotee, cannot suffer his separation from God,

God also cannot bear it from him.
"
529,"488 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4 |
: ‘Though the words ""Yatha' (in whatever way) and 'Tatha’ (so) |
explains, that in whatever way a devotee seeks Him, He reciprocates
his sentiments, yet there is a great difference in their manner. If
a devotee takes one step towards God, God may take hundreds |
of strides to meet him. The Lord is omnipresent, omnipotent
and omniscient. Moreover, He is His devotee’s supreme and
unselfish friend and true to His resolve. A devotee should use
his full power to attain Him, then the Lord is attained, through -
His limitless power. |
A striver himself, creates obstacle in God-realization, because nnn
he does not apply his intellect, resources, time and power etc., to
| the full. extent, in order to attain Him. If he, without regarding
these as his own, utilizes them fully for God-realization, he
may realize Him soon. Actually, they are the Lord's, because
they have been bestowed upon by Him. A feeling of ‘mine’, -
is the main obstacle to God-realization. Man himself, is also a
fragment of God, but he considers himself separate from God, -
while the Lord does not think so. :
In fact, a striver cannot develop devotion to God, through the ;
performance of actions. Devotion, is automatically bestowed upon
a devotee, who takes refuge in Him. The refuge (surrender), is
the best sentiment out of all the other feeling such as of service,
of friendship, of affection and of sweet love etc. The Lord seems
to declare, that if a devotee dedicates his possessions to Him,
God would offer His possessions to the devotee; and if he offers
himself to Him, God reciprocates. What an easy and economic
transaction, God-realization 1s! |
When a devotee, surrenders himself at His feet, He does
not even remember his sins, of the past. He only thinks of his
| present emotions, hundreds of times (Manasa 1/29/3).
In this (eleventh) verse, there is no description of scriptural
subjects, such as dualism or non-dualism, the Lord endowed with
attributes or attributeless, or different kinds of salvation etc. But,
"
530,"Verse 11] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 489 .
here is a description of the feeling of ‘mine’, with God. ‘Only -
God is mine and I am only God's—this feeling of ‘mine’ for God,
enables a striver to attain Him, quickly and easily. Therefore, a
striver should accept his affinity for God, even if he does not |
understand it. By doing so, he will realize his affinity for Him .
which is real. oo |
Question:—The Lord, reciprocates the same sentiment with
which a devotee seeks Him. If a devotees approaches Him with oe
the sentiment of hatred or enmity etc., will the Lord, reciprocate
the same? a -
-Answer:—This is a topic of surrender (refuge) to Him, rather
than of hatred or enmity. So, no such question, should arise. Even
then, if we think over the question seriously, we come to realise
that the purpose of the Lord in reciprocating the same sentiment
to the person concerned, is to inspire him for salvation.* The Lord -
is a disinterested friend of all.beings (Gita 5/29). Therefore, he |
thinks of their welfare and acts, accordingly. He does the same,
_ even for those who may have feelings of hatred and enmity, -
for Him. When Lord Rama sents Angada as a messenger to the
court of Ravana, He urges him to convey his message in such -
a way that His purpose may be served and it may contribute to
his (Ravana's) welfare (Manasa 6/17/4).
Not only the Lord, but His devotees, are also disinterested |
friends of all beings (Srimadbhagavata 3/25/21). When, even a
devotee cannot harm anyone, how can the Lord, Who is the most
merciful and disinterested friend of all beings, harm anyone? A
person, may have affinity for Him with any sentiment yet He
inspires him for salvation only. As a bath in the Ganges, both in
winter and summer is rewarding, yet while bathing in winter a
man feels cold and during summer, he feels refreshed. Similarly,
| * Many persons out of desire, hatred, fear and love having concentrated their
minds on God, being purged of their sins, have attained God in the same way as |
devotees attain Him through devotion (Stimadbhagavata 7/1/29).
"
531,"490 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4
those devotees who worship Him with devotion attain eternal
bliss, but that bliss is not attained by those who have negative
feelings of hatred or enmity for Him.
‘Mama_ vartmanuvartante manusyah partha sarvasah'—
Whatsoever, a great man does, the same is done by others, as
well (Gita 3/21). God is the supreme Being. He is superior to
all the great men. So all people follow Him. The same fact, has
been pointed out, in the second half of the twenty-third verse -
of the third chapter. |
The Lord, ever remains prepared to reciprocate the wo
sentiment of His devotee. King DaSsaratha treats Him, as his
son. So He becomes an obedient son and cannot disobey His
father.* The Lord, wants to reveal the secret that a devotee
should accept the same relationship with Him, which he has
with a persons who is most loving to him, whether he is his -
son, father or whether she is his mother. By doing so, the Lord
will become most loving to him and thus the person will be
able to attain Him easily. Oo 7
Secondly, the Lord wants to urge the people, that by following
His footsteps they should also become worthy sons or parents or -
brothers, husbands, wives or sisters etc. Moreover, they should
render service to other members of a family, without expecting
any reward from them and without being proud of their action.
Those who have affinity with parents and other relatives, only
for rendering selfless service to them, follow the Lord's path in
the real sense. By doing so, for the good of others they will be |
free from the feeling of 'mine', and they will develop devotion
for God and attain Him.
Egoistic notions and selfishness, are the stumbling blocks to
* Lord Rama declares, ""I can enter fire, can eat deadly poison and can
jump into the sea in order to carry out the order of My father (Valmiki Ramayana,
Ayodhya. 18/28-29).
"
532,"Verse 11] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 491 :
devotion for God. When a man loves anyone, without egoism .
and selfishness, that love automatically flows towards the Lord.

It is because of egoism and selfishness, that his love is confined

to narrow limits. But, when such evil propensities are renounced, _

his love becomes widespread. In that case, the assumed affinity ,
for the world perishes, and instinctively the real affinity for God |
is revealed.

The man (soul) is a fragment of God (Gita 15/7) and so .
his affinity for God, is natural. But when he (the soul) having
forgotten this real affinity, assumes the affinity for the world, Se
he has to follow, the cycle (bondage) of birth and death. This
bondage is twofold. One is due to his not realizing his real
affinity with God. Another, is due to his assumed affinity with
the world. But when he realizes his real affinity for God i.e.,

~ takes refuge in Him, he becomes free from worry, fear, sorrow, -
and doubt. Then, he is said to follow, the Lord's path.

Appendix—Though this universe is clearly the manifestation
of God, yet the Lord reveals Himself before us in the same :
Form in which we perceive (see) Him. We regarding the self as
body need things and desire them, then God manifests Himself ""
in the form of those things. If being established in the ‘Asat’

(unreal), we perceive (see) the unreal, the Lord is also perceived
in the unreal form. As a child wants a toy, its father brings it a
toy even by spending money, similarly whatever we want, the
most merciful God ever being eternal Reality appears before us —
in the same form. If we don’t desire pleasures, why should the
Lord appear before us in the form of pleasures? Why need He
assume the artificial Form?

Though the terms ‘yatha’ and ‘tatha’ (‘as’ and ‘so’) have
been used for the Lord’s nature, yet the Lord ever showers His
great grace upon beings because an insignificant being can’t
be compared with the supreme Lord. What is the strength of
its own in a being except the sense of pride? Even then if a
"
533,"492 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4
person is attracted towards God, God is also attracted towards :
the person. As Viduraniji was oblivious of herself after beholding
Lord Krsna, Lord Krsna also was not in Himself and he ate the

skin of banana offered by Viduraniji and relished it.

In the Lord’s nature ‘yatha-tatha’ are applicable in actions :
rather than in feelings. The Lord also showers His love and
grace on an atheist ever in the same way as He showers it on
a theist (believer). Therefore in the Lord’s ‘yatha-tatha’ there is -
no selfish motive but it 1s the Lord’s glory (greatness) otherwise |
how can a common being be compared with the greatest Lord? oe
Even then he makes friends with an ordinary being and elevates
him equal to His rank. The Lord does not regard Himself as
great—this is His greatness.

Those who desire the fruit of their actions, worship the gods;
because success is quickly attained, by men through action, 12 :
Comment:—_

""Kanksantah karmanam siddhim yajanta iha devatah'—A man,
is eligible to perform new actions, and it is seen that success is
attained through action. So, he firmly believes that God is also
realized, through action (penance, meditation and trance etc.,)
just as, worldly objects are acquired through actions. He, does
not pay attention to the fact, that worldly things are acquired /
"
534,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 493 .

through actions, as they are limited, they are not ever attained, -

they are separate from us, and they are changeful, while the Lord _

cannot be acquired, through action, as He is not a product of

action. He pervades everywhere, is ever attained, is not separate

from us (the self) and is unchanging. So, He can be attained, as -

soon as a Keen desire to realize Him, is aroused. Keen desire

for God-realization, 1s not aroused, because of the preference,

for worldly pleasures and prosperity. -
The Lord, is like a father, while the gods are like shopkeepers.

We can take a thing from a shopkeeper, only by paying the money i

but we can take it from the father, free of cost. Similarly, we

have to perform rituals according to scriptural methods for gods,

in order to obtain fruits from them, while God bestows upon us

our necessities, free of cost. Moreover, as a shopkeeper gives

even hazardous things, such as, a match box or a knife etc., to -

a boy on payment, but if the boy wants such things from his

father, the latter will not only refuse but take away, the money

also. A father gives only beneficial things to a boy. The gods, -

also bestow upon their devotees, harmful gifts without thinking

of their welfare, at the due completion of a ritual. But the Lord, -

like a father, bestows only those gifts, which are for the welfare

of devotees. In spite of this fact, the ignorant or dull-witted

people, because of their attachment, sense of mine and desire

for the perishable materials, worship other gods, as they do not

realise the glory, the benevolence and selflessness, friendliness

of the Lord (Gita 7/20—23; 9/23-24). | ;
'Ksiprarh hi manuse loke siddhirbhavati karmaja'— This human

world, is the field for actions. Besides this, other worlds, such

as heaven and hell etc., are for reaping fruits of past actions.

The Lord also declares, ‘Below in the world of men stretch

forth the roots (of the universe as a tree) entangling man, in

the bondage of actions (Gita 15/2). But the other worlds (heaven

and hell etc.,) exist, so that human beings may reap desirable or |

undesirable fruits respectively of their virtuous and evil actions. |
"
535,"494 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4 |
Only human beings, are eligible to perform new actions, which

bear fruit here, as well as hereafter. Beasts and birds etc., cannot
perform new actions. | |

In this human world those people, who are attached to action,
live (Gita 14/15). It 1s because of their attachment to actions, that ,
they are charmed by success, which is attained through action.

This success is attained quickly, but it is shortlived. When actions
are transitory, how could success attained through actions, be -
permanent? Therefore, the fruit of perishable actions, is also 7
perishable. Those who perform actions with a desire for fruit, —
think of the fruit only, they do not think of the perishable nature, BO
of that fruit. They take refuge in the gods and worship them, only
_ because they bestow upon them success quickly, when rituals are
duly completed. But because of their desire for fruit of action, they
never get liberated, from the bondage of action. Consequently, they -
have to follow the cycle of birth and death.

The real success of human life is God-realization and that

: cannot be attained, through action. A striver cannot even follow, 7
the Disciplines of Action, Knowledge and Devotion, which are
the means of God-realization, through action. He can attain Yoga, -
not through action but through the, renouncement of actions.

Question:—Action is, said to be, the means to attain Yoga
(Gita 6/3). Then, how is it, that a man cannot attain Yoga
through action?

Answer:—In Karmayoga, actions are performed, in order to
renounce affinity for actions, and the material for actions. Yoga
(union with God) is natural. So Yoga or God-realization cannot
be attained through actions. In fact, actions are unreal, but when
these are performed for the sake of the Supreme, they are called
‘Sat’ viz., real (Gita 17/27).

When a person, performs action with a selfish motive, he does
not realize Yoga (i.e., eternal union with God). In Karmayoga,
actions are performed for others, not for one's own self i.e., not
"
536,"Verse 13-14] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 495 |
for their fruit (Gita 2/47). Actions, which are performed with a |
selfish motive, bind a man (Gita 3/9) while actions, which are
performed for others, liberate him, from the bondage of actions
(Gita 4/23). When actions are performed for others, affinity for
actions and their fruit is renounced, and that renouncement is
conducive to the realization of Yoga 1.e., union with God. |

While performing actions, a man has to depend on the
changing objects, such as the body, senses, mind, intellect, ~
person etc., which are different from the self (soul). The self,
ever remains uniform without undergoing any modification, at Se renee
all. Therefore, in Self-realization there is no need, in the least for
the objects, such as the body etc., which are different from the
self. A-‘man, naturally realizes the self, as soon as he renounces
his assumed affinity for worldly objects etc., which are different -
from him (the self). | |

Link:—Having described the object of His manifestation, -
in the eighth verse, the Lord explains the merit of knowing the
divine character of his actions, in the ninth verse. There He -
explained, that actions lose their divine character t.e., become
impure, when these are performed with a desire for fruit. In the
next two verses, the Lord specially, explains how, they gain their
divine character (purity).

‘Caturvarnyarh maya srstari gunakarmavibhagasah'—The Lord,
created the four castes (order)—Brahmana, Ksatriya, Vaisya and :
Sidra, according to the modes of nature, and actions of previous
birth.* Besides human beings, the Lord created the gods, manes ss ~ aan
and other forms of life also, according to the modes of their
nature and action, without showing the least partiality. -

- The fourfold caste (order), does not apply only to human >
beings, but also to birds, beasts and trees etc. Among birds, pigeons |
are regarded as Brahmana; hawks, kites and crows are regarded
respectively as Ksatriya, Vaisya and Sidra. Similarly Pipala, Nima, |
Tamarind and Acacia, are regarded respectively as Brahmana, —__ -
Ksatriya, Vaisya and Sidra. But, here the term 'Caturvarnyarh’ |
stands only for human beings, because they can understand this -
distinction and can perform their duty, accordingly.

‘When the Lord declares, that the fourfold caste was created
by Him, He means to say that all of these are his fragments and |
He is their disinterested friend. Therefore, He always thinks of
their welfare. On the other hand, they are neither fragments of
the gods nor are the gods their disinterested friends. So they |
should worship Him, only though the performance of their own
duty (Gita 18/46).

Sidra) are classified according to the mode of nature. In Brahmana the mode of
goodness predominates; in Ksatriya the mode of passion predominates, while the
modes of goodness is secondary; in Vaisya the mode of passion predominates,
while the mode of ignorance is secondary (subordinate); while in Siidra the mode
of ignorance predominates. Thus the castes were determined on the basis of the
mode of nature. :
"
538,"Verse 13-14] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 497 :
- *Tasya kartaramapi mam viddhyakartaramavyayam'—Though,

the Lord creates, preserves and destroys the entire universe yet He a

‘remains unconnected, (untainted) as He has no feeling of doership. |

He is called 'Avyayam' (unspent) only He is the material, as

well as, the efficient cause of creation. For example, in a pot of .

clay, clay is material cause and the potter is the efficient cause,

because while creating the world He remains uniform; neither

His energy is spent to create it, like the potter who spends his .

energy to make a pot, nor is the material consumed, when the

pot is made. | ee

The soul, being a fragment of God is also imperishable.

But, a man does not realize this fact, because he regards the

acquired body, senses, mind, intellect, wealth and property etc., -

as his own, and for himself. As soon as, he regards these as the

world's and for the world, he will realize his immortality. -

By using the term ‘Viddhi', the Lord urges strivers, to
understand the divine nature of His actions. When actions are -
performed without having any affinity for those or, the material
and the fruit of actions, then these become divine. _- ;

'Na math karm4ni limpanti na me karmaphale sprha'—When
the Lord, creates the universe, He has not the least affinity for
his actions, nor is there any flaw or partiality etc., in His actions,
nor any attachment or feeling of ‘mine’, or desire for the fruit
of actions. So those actions do not taint Him.

All perishable objects, are fruits of actions. The Lord urges |
strivers, that they, like Him should have no craving for the fruit |
of actions. If they perform actions, without having any craving
for the fruit of actions, the actions will not bind them. |

In the thirteenth verse, the Lord explained that He is a non-
doer i.e., He has no sense of doership,; in spite of performing
all actions, such as the creation of the universe etc. In this
verse, He explains that He has no craving for the fruit of
actions. Therefore, a striver should also perform actions, without
"
539,"498 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4 =.
a sense of doership and without having any desire for the fruit |
of actions. By doing so, he is automatically liberated from the -
bondage of actions. |

""Iti mam yo'bhijanati'—Desires are born, when a man has
an eye on the perishable mundane objects and then he cannot ”
know the reality about God, Who is immortal. As soon as,
desires are renounced, the inner sense is purified and then
naturally one reflects on God. By having an eye on Him, :
he comes to know that, He is a disinterested friend of all
beings, and all actions performed by Him, aim at the welfare, ee
of all beings. The Lord, bestows this human body upon us,
in order to enable us to be liberated from the bondage of
actions. But, a man without knowing this fact, assumes his
affinity for actions, and is thus held captive. Therefore the
Lord in spite of having, neither a sense of doership, nor, desire -
for fruit, creates the universe by His grace, so as to inspire
human beings, to attain salvation, by becoming free from the
bondage of actions. When a man knows Him thus (in reality),
he is attracted to Him. So Lord Siva in the Ramacaritamanasa
says to Uma, ""He who knows the nature of Lord Rama, ever -
remains engrossed in His adoration"" (5/34/2). |

""Karmabhirna sa badhyate'—The Lord's actions are ever divine.
The actions of saints and sages also become divine. Not only
saints and sages, but also men can make their actions divine, by
doing away with desire, attachment and a sense of 'mine’, which
are impurities in actions. When actions are purged of impurities,
these become divine and they do not bind men. These lead them,
as well as others, (who follow them), to salvation.

An easy means, to make actions divine is to use the objects
etc., acquired from the world, to render service to the world,
without regarding these as one's own, and for one's own self. |

We should give a serious thought to the fact, that we neither
brought the objects, such as the body etc., with us, when we
"
540,"Verse 13-14] SADHAKA-SANIHIVANI , 499 -

came, nor can we carry these with us when we go, or change |

these of our own accord, nor maintain them. Similarly, the subtle -

and the causal bodies, being the evolutes of nature (prakrti), also

undergo modifications and therefore, we have no affinity for

these. Moreover, those objects are not for us, because had they -

been for us, or having acquired them, there would have been

no further desire, to acquire anything else. So it is a blunder to

accept these as ours, and for us. They seem to us to be ours, -

so that we use them 1n rendering service to others rather than

to lay a claim on them. | ee
We should have no desire to acquire anything from the

world nor even, to gain any favour from God. We should rather

surrender ourselves to Him. The Lord Himself, has provided all

the necessities of life to us,.because He is very gracious and

merciful. He knows our needs more than we know ours as we -

are dull-witted while, He is very sharp. So, without desiring

anything, we should use the things that we possess, for the 7

welfare of others without any selfish motive. By doing so our

affinity for actions and objects etc., is renounced and God, Who

is an embodiment of Bliss is realized. -
Appendix—Though the author of worldly creation, the non-

doership of God remains unaffected, similarly the non-doership |

of the self also remains unaffected—‘Sarirastho’pi kaunteya na

karoti na lipyate’ (Gita 13/31). But being deluded, he thinks

that he is the doer—‘ahankaravimudhatma kartahamiti manyate’

(Gita 3/27).
‘Karma’, ‘Kriya’ and ‘Lila’—the three may appear to be

the same but really they are totally different. The ‘Kriya’

which is done with the sense of egoism and bears desirable

and undesirable fruit, is called ‘Karma’ (action). The ‘kriya’

(activity) which is done without the sense of doership and which

does not bear fruit, is called ‘kriya’ as breathing, opening and

closing the eyes, movement of the pulse, beating of the heart |
"
541,"500 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4
etc. The ‘Kriya’ which is free from the sense of doership and ""
from the desire for fruit, and also divine, and for the welfare -
of the world, is called “Lila’. Actions done by worldly people
are karma and by liberated people are kriya* and by God
they are mere sports or say “Lila’—‘lokavattu llakaivalyam’ -
(Brahmasutra 2/1/33) viz., as the world without real existence
appears to be existing, similarly the Lord’s activity such as
the creation of the universe etc., is merely His pastime. It -
means that the Lord in spite of being the non-doer seems to
be a doer because of His pastime. | So

‘Caturvarnyamh maya srstarhn gunakarmavibhagasah’—this
expression proves that according to the Gita a person’s caste
is determined by his birth. A person’s caste or Varna (order of
life) is determined by the caste of his parents. The word ‘jati’ |
is made from the root ‘jani pradurbhave’ which proves that the :
caste 1s determined by birth. By ‘Karma’ there is the word ‘krti’
which is made from the root ‘dukrfi karane’. But the caste is -
fully preserved by only discharging the duty prescribed for one’s
own caste. .

was a seeker of liberation (salvation), but he did not think that
the performance of his duty (of fighting) would lead him to .
salvation. So he wanted to renounce the duty, as to him it
was horrible (Gita 3/1). Therefore, Lord Krsna urges Arjuna a
to attain salvation, through performing his duty, and cited the
example of ancient seekers of liberation, who attained salvation
by performing their duty. |
The Lord, is emphasizing the same fact here, which He _
mentioned, in the twentieth verse of the third chapter, by citing
the example of Janaka and others, and, in the first and second |
verses of this chapter, by citing examples of Vivasvan, Manu _
and Iksvaku etc.
It is mentioned in the scriptures, that when desire for liberation -
is aroused in a striver, he should abandon actions, because in that
case, he becomes eligible to attain knowledge (wisdom), rather
than to perform actions.* But here, He urges Arjuna, a seeker
of liberation, to perform his duty in a disinterested manner, and
cites the example of other ancient seekers of liberation.
Karmayoga (Discipline of Action) consists, in remaining
established in Yoga (union with God) while performing duty, _
and in performing duty while remaining firm in Yoga. Actions
are performed for the world, while Yoga (union with God) is
for one's own self. Performance of actions and non-performance |
of actions, are two states. A Yogi, transcends the two, without

being attached to either of the two. This Yoga is detachment
incarnate. This is not a state. It is God-realization. .
The Lord, in the fourteenth verse, declared, ""Actions do not
taint (bind) Me, since I have no craving for the fruit of actions.""
A person, who having known this skill (Karmayoga) performs _
actions, by renouncing the desire for fruit, is not bound by actions,
as the Lord declares, ""He who is attached to the fruit of action,
| is bound"" (Gita 5/12). Actions, which a man performs, in order -
to gain pleasures or wealth or honour and praise or paradise
etc., bind him (Gita 3/9). But, if he performs actions, for the — ........
_ well being of others, without any selfish motive, to renounce his
affinity for the world, the actions do not bind him (Gita 4/23).
_ The reason is, that when actions are performed for others, the
. flow is towards the world and thus attachment for them perishes.
No new affinity for them is born, because there is no desire ~
a for the fruit. :
| ""Kuru karmaiva tasmattvam piurvaih pirvataram krtam'—  _
| The Lord orders Arjuna to perform actions, for the welfare of
the world, like other seekers of liberation, because he 1s also a
_ seeker of liberation. , 7
All the mundane materials, such as, the body, senses, mind
and intellect etc., required for the performance of actions, have
_ their identity with the world, while they are different from the
self. They have been acquired from the world, so that service
to the world may be rendered, with them. If they are used by
- a person in performing actions for himself, he gets attached to
those actions, but if all actions are performed for the welfare of
: others, he is not attached to them. As soon as, this attachment
is renounced, he realizes his Yoga i.e., union with God, which
- is eternal. ,
Appendix—In the thirteenth and fourteenth verses the Lord
declared, “I. perform actions such as the creation of the universe
etc., but those actions don’t bind Me because I am free from

544,"Verse 16] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 503 :
the sense of doership and the desire of fruit.” Here the Lord
declares that the seekers of salvation have also performed actions -
by renouncing the sense of doership and the desire for fruit. The
reason is that actions performed with the sense of doership and ;
with the desire for fruit alone lead to bondage. Therefore the :
Lord asks Arjuna to perform actions in the same way as the
seekers of salvation have performed. !
In Jiianayoga first there is renunciation of the sense of -
doership and then the desire for fruit automatically disappears.
In Karmayoga first there is renunciation of the desire for fruit OO
and then the sense of doership easily get extinct.

knowing which, you shall be liberated, from its evil effect (i.e.,)
worldly bondage. 16
Comment:—-
‘Kim karma'— Common men believe that activities done with
the body and senses are mere actions, while non-performance of
an act, is inaction. But, the Lord declares that activities performed
with body, speech and mind, are actions (Gita 18/15).
An action, is determined by the: motive by which, it is
performed. An action, such as adoration of a goddess, is of the
"
545,"504 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA  =—=———s‘[Chapter4
mode of goodness, but if it is undertaken with the motive of
fulfilling mundane. desires, it becomes a mode of passion. If it —
is undertaken with the motive of someone's ruin, the same action
is, of the mode of ignorance. In the same way, actions which
are performed without attachment, a sense of mine and desire
for fruits, are classed as inaction, and these do not bind a man,
to the fruit of action. It means, that truth about action cannot be
determined by outward activity only. In this connection, even wise ~
men, possessing knowledge of the scriptures get confused, L.e.,
they are, at a loss to understand the truth. An action is classed, ——--—---—-
as an action or inaction, or is forbidden, according to the motive
with which it is performed, Therefore, the Lord declares, that
He will explain to Arjuna, what action is, why and how it binds
.. aman, and how he can be liberated from it and by knowing
| the truth about it. ;
If a man, has a sense of mine, attachment and desire for
' fruits, it means that action is being performed by himie., he -
is tainted by that action, even though he does not perform an
outward action. On the other hand, if he has neither a sense of __
mine, nor attachment nor.desire for fruit, it means that actions
are not being performed by him i.e., he is not tainted by such
actions, even though he performs actions. Thus performance or |
non-performance of actions is inaction, if he has no attachment,
while performance or non-performance of actions is classed as
action, if he has any attachment. |

'Kimakarmeti'—The Lord, divided action into two
groups—actions and inaction. Actions, bind a man, while inactions
(which are undertaken for others) liberate him.

In reality, physical abjuring of actions, is not inaction.
The Lord, has declared that the renunciation of actions,
through delusion is stated to be, of the nature of ‘ignorance’
(Gita 18/7). The exclusion of action, from fear of physical
suffering, is called ‘passionate’ (Gita 18/8). In the renunciation
"
546,"Verse 16] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 505
of the nature of ‘ignorance’ and ‘passion’, the affinity for actions is |
not renounced, though the performance of actions is. Renunciation, :
in which attachment and desire for reward, are abandoned, is _
regarded as one of 'goodness' (Gita 18/9). In fact, this is. called -
‘inaction’, because affinity for actions is renounced in such a

exclusion. Therefore, inaction, consists in the performance of

actions, by remaining untainted by them.

‘Even the wise are confused, about the truth of what, an :
inaction is. The reality about an action or an inaction is, that it :
should not bind a man. Arjuna holds that he will attain salvation 7 oe
if he does not indulge himself in the cruel deed of fighting. So
the Lord declares, that a man does not attain to perfection, by :
mere renunciation of action (Gita 3/4) but he can attain it, even |
by engaging himself in battle (Gita 2/38). -

Thus inaction, consists either in the performance of actions
by remaining untainted or in remaining untainted, while
performing actions. | -

'Kavayo'pyatra mohitah’'—How can common men understand
the truth about action and inaction, when even the learned who
are well-versed in the scriptures, are at a loss to grasp this topic?

It means, that only the liberated souls or the Lord knows, the
truth about action and inaction. | : 7

'Tatte karma pravaksyami'—A man, (the soul) is bound
by actions, so he would also be liberated, by action. The Lord
promises here that, He will declare the reality about actions, so
that they may not lead him to bondage and he may be liberated _
from the bondage of the cycle of birth and death.

In fact, it is neither action nor inaction;which binds a man, |
but it is the desire, the sense of mine and attachment, which
bind him. If he renounces desire and feelings of possession and
attachment, he is liberated, while performing action, and not by |
performing it. One, who understands this fact, knows the reality
about actions.
"
547,"| 506 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4  ~
In the fiftieth verse of the second chapter, the Lord declared,
""Yoga is skill in action.” It means that Yoga viz., equanimity ~
(evenness of mind) is the means to be liberated from the binding
nature of actions. Arjuna could not understand this point; therefore,
the Lord promises to explain this point again. .

of these. |
As the body, senses, mind and intellect etc., are acquired these
are transitory. They should be used, only in rendering service
. to the world, because these have been acquired from the world.
Moreover, these will have to be renounced. But, the Self or God
Who is ours, can never be renounced. Only that which is really
not ours, but we have assumed as ours, is renounced. In fact, _
this is not renunciation, it is discrimination.
: All materials, (the body, senses, mind and intellect etc.,) are |
neither of the self, nor for the self, but are of the world and for
the world. The self ever remains unaffected and uniform, while the
) materials are changing. Therefore whatever action 1s performed,
with these materials is for the good of others, not for the self. In
this there is a vital fact, that no action can be performed, without
materials. Even the greatest writer cannot write, without ink, pen
and paper, which are of the world. Therefore, when a person,
uses the articles of the world for the world, he in fact, does not
render any service to the world, he gives the things of the world
to the world. Thus he merely uses his discrimination. Thus, it is
discrimination which leads to renunciation and service.
Discrimination has been bestowed upon beings from time
immemorial. Had it been the fruit of virtuous action, how could
virtuous actions have been performed, without discrimination? It
"
548,"Verse 16] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 507 7
is discrimination by which one can resolve, to perform virtuous a
actions, by renouncing evil actions. As discrimination is self- a
evident, so is Karmayoga (Discipline of Action) which involves
no labour. Similarly, in the Discipline of Knowledge, the self .
(Which is detached) is self-evident, while in the Discipline of =
Devotion, the affinity for God is self-evident.
'Yajjiatva moksyase'subhat'—The self, is good and virtuous,
while the ever-changing world, is bad or evil. The self, in spite of -
being an eternal fragment of God, and developing adisinclination ==
for God, has got entangled in the perishable world. The Lord oe ,
declares, that He will describe reality about action, by knowing,
which he (Asjuna) will be liberated from its evil effect i.e., worldly
bondage of the cycle of birth and death. Oo |
[The topic of knowledge of action, which begins in this verse,
will be concluded in the thirty-second verse with the declaration, ~
""Thus knowing, thou shalt be liberated"".] |
In the term, 'Karmayoga' Karma (actions) are performed for
the world, while Yoga (union with God), is for the self. Action Oe
and non-action—these are the two states of action, which involve
egoism. So long as, a man has egoistic notions he has, affinity
for the world; and so long as he has affinity for the world, he .
continues to have egoistic notions. But ""Yoga' transcends the two
states. In order to realize that Yoga it is essential to be free
from egoism. The method of being free from egoism, is |
performance or non-performance of actions, by being equanimous
and remaining equanimous during performance or non-
performance, of actions. It means, that he should have equanimity
(evenness of mind) during the performance and non-performance
of actions (Gita 2/48), i.e., he should remain untainted. |
Those, who believe that a man is inclined towards the world
by performance of actions, and is inclined towards God through :
"
549,"508 _ SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4  -
non-performance of actions, and having a disinclination for the
world, meditate on God and experience a trance, also perform _
actions. The feeling, that God (perfection) will be attained through
meditation and trance, is also a subtle form of action, because
one expects God-realization through performance of actions, in _
the form of meditation and trance, while God is beyond action,
as well as inaction.
The Lord declares, that He will explain the reality about _
action by which one will attain God, immediately. God pervades
: everywhere, all the time, through things, persons, bodies, senses,
minds, intellects and life-breaths etc., equally. He remains united.
with us, when we perform actions and when we do not perform
actions. But, we are unable to realize Him, because of our affinity —
for actions and objects, born of nature (prakrti).
Aman has an egoistic notion, equally during the performance -
| of actions, as well as during the non-performance of actions, but his
egoism merges in the world, when he instead of performing actions
for himself, performs these, for the welfare of the world. -

Comment:—
‘Karmano hyapi boddhavyam'— He, who remains untainted
while performing actions, knows the truth about actions, described
"
550,"Verse 17] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 509
in the eighteenth verse, by the expression, ""He who sees inaction -
in action.""

Actions can be divided, into three groups, according to the
motive by which these are performed (1.e.,) action, inaction and :
forbidden action. An activity undertaken, according to spiritual
injunctions with a desire for fruit, is called, action. Action
which is performed, being free from the desire for fruit, sense 7
of mine and attachment, for the welfare of others, is classed, 7
as inaction. Even prescribed action, performed with the motive
of doing evil to others, or giving pain to them, is classed as, oO
forbidden action.

'Akarmanasca boddhavyam'— He, who performs actions, while
remaining untainted, knows the reality about inaction, described :
in the eighteenth verse, by the expression ‘action in inaction.’ -

""Boddhavyam ca vikarmanah'—When a man has desire, actions
are performed. But when desire is enhanced, then forbidden ;
actions (sinful) are done.

The Lord, in the thirty-eighth verse of second chapter,
declared, ""Treating alike, pleasure and pain, gain and loss, :
victory and defeat, get ready for battle, the horrible deed involving
violence; thus thou shalt not incur sin."" It means, that if actions
are performed with equanimity, the seemingly forbidden actions /
are also transformed, into inaction.

Forbidden actions, are called 'Vikarma’'. Desire is the cause
of forbidden actions (Gita 3/36-37).* Therefore, in order to give
up forbidden actions, one should renounce desire. The essence of
""Vikarma’ (sin), is desire and to know the essence of ""Vikarma’,
is to abandon all forbidden actions physically and so leave no
trace of desire which is the cause of ""Vikarma’.

* In the sixteenth chapter where the demoniac nature has been described
there from the eighth verse to the twenty-third verse the term 'Kama’' (desire)
has been used nine times. It shows that desire is the cause of demoniac nature |
(forbidden actions).
"
551,"510 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4
'Gahania karmano gatih'—It is difficult to understand, which .
actions bind a man and which liberate him. Even learned men,
knowing the scriptures cannot decide, 'What is action?’ 'What
is inaction?’ and ""What is forbidden action?’ Arjuna also, finds = -
himself in a dilemma and so he thinks, that the performance of
his duty of fighting is a cruel deed. Therefore, the Lord states,
‘that mysterious is the nature of action. _
Question:—In this verse, the Lord declares, that truth about |
forbidden actions must be known, while He does not make mention wo
of the forbidden actions, in the topic from the nineteenth verse
to the twenty-third verse. Why? : |
Answer:—In the topic (from the nineteenth verse to the twenty-
third verse), the Lord, has prominently mentioned inaction in
action so that all actions may turn to inaction 1.e., actions may -
not lead to bondage. A desire is the root of every action. As
the desire intensifies, it results in forbidden actions. Therefore it -
is said that Vikarma is quite near to karma. Therefore, the Lord
has referred to forbidden actions, as wretched, so that men may
renounce these, as well as the desire which is their main root. :
First, desire leads a man to action, and then its enhancement,
leads one to perform forbidden actions. But, when desire is ;
renounced, all actions tum to, inaction. The significance of
the topic, discussed in these verses, is to know the essence of
inaction and what leads to annihilation of desires. When desire
is renounced forbidden actions are not performed. So the Lord,
does not consider it necessary to include 'Vikarma’, in the topic,
from the nineteenth to the twenty-third verses. Secondly, the Lord
does not want to dwell upon forbidden actions in detail, because
these must be renounced as they lead to sins and hells. But, in
this topic there is an emphasis on, the renunciation of desire—in
4/19 by the expression ‘devoid of desires and thoughts of the
world’, in 4/20 by, the expression ‘having abandoned attachment
to the fruit of action’, in 4/21 by the expression ‘having no desire’,
"
552,"Verse 18] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 511. -
in 4/22 by 'even-minded in success and failure’, and in 4/23 by |
‘One who is devoid of attachment and works for sacrifice.’ -
Thus, the Lord has said, that truth about forbidden actions =
must be known, so that a man, having known it, may renounce -
desire, which is the root of forbidden actions. .
Appendix—lIt is very difficult to gaze what fruit an action bears -
at present and in future for others. While performing an actiona |
man thinks that it is of benefit to him but actually it causes harm -
to him. He may work for profit but it may end in loss. He acts
for pleasure whereas his act results in pain. The reason 1s that due To meee
to the sense of doership and the desire for fruit (attachment to —
pleasure), man cannot determine the true nature of actions.
Link:—In the next verse, the Lord eulogizes a person who -
knows the truth, about actions. |

Comment:—
'Karmanyakarma yah paSyet'—'Seeing inaction in action’ |
means, to remain untainted during performance or non-performance
of actions. It means also that performance or non-performance
of actions, is not for the self. When a man thinks that he is the
doer and so he should reap the fruit of action, he is bound by
such actions. As actions are perishable, so is their fruit. The self,
is eternal and has no affinity for the changing actions, and their
fruits. Yet, It is bound, because of the desire, for fruit. Therefore,
the Lord in the fourteenth verse declared, ""Actions don't bind |
"
553,"512 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA _ [Chapter4
Me, because I have ‘no desire, for the fruit of actions."" It is the
desire for fruit, which binds one. The Lord declares, ""He who ;
is attached to the fruit of action, is bound"" (Gita 5/12). |
If a striver, has no desire for fruit, new attachment does not .
arise; and old attachment perishes, when actions are performed
for the welfare of others. Thus, he becomes, totally dispassionate.
This dispassionate nature, turns all actions into inaction.
A man, has to take birth either to be free of obligations or
receive these from others, for all previous births. This exchange
has been going on for several births. He cannot get rid of the ne
cycle of birth and death, so long as, he does not repay his debt.
The way to close his account is, that he should pay to others |
what he owes to them and should not expect them to repay to
him, their debts. Thus, the account will be closed and, he will _
be liberated, from the cycle of birth and death (Gita 4/23).
If a person does nothing for himself, and has no desire,
he gets detached from all actions and objects etc., because all :
objects and materials etc., such as the body, senses, mind, intellect
and life-breaths are of the world, not one’s own as these have .
been acquired from the world, so that service may be rendered
to the world with these. Therefore, when a striver performs all
actions (service, adoration, chant, meditation entrances also) for ;
the welfare of the world, the flow of action is towards the world
and the striver, remains detached and untainted. This is ‘seeing
inaction in action.’
So long as, a striver has affinity for the body and the world,
the performance or non-performance of actions, will be included
in action. So, a Karmayogi should remain untainted (detached),
while he performs actions, as also while he does not. When a
man performs actions, without having any desire for fruit, profit,
honour, praise and pleasure, here or hereafter, it means, that
he is detached (untainted) during the performance of actions.
Similarly, when he does not perform any action, he should not
"
554,"Verse 18] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 513 :
desire, in the least, to gain honour, praise, pleasures and bodily _ |
rest etc., by non-perfotmance of actions.

He, who abandons action, because it is painful or out of fear —
from physical suffering or practises relinquishment of passion, |
(Rajasa Tyaga)while he who renounces his obligatory duty :
out of delusion, indolence and heedlessness, practises Tamasa
Tyaga. Both kinds of relinquishment, must be totally abandoned.
Similarly, if a man does not perform action, so that he may -
enjoy the state of meditation or trance or liberation, he does
not get detached from nature (prakrti). When he renounces his ae
full affinity for nature, he remains untainted while performing
actions or not performing these. .

‘Akarmani ca karma yah'— ‘Seeing action in inaction’ means,
performing action or not performing it, by being detached (untainted).

- Worldly people want to gain, something or the other,
through performance and non-performance of actions, while a
Karmayogis only aim through the two, is the welfare of the -
world, by remaining detached. The Lord declares, “For him there
is no interest, in what is done or what is not done"" (Gita 3/18). .
If he has any self-interest, he is not a Karmayogi, but is rather
a doer of actions. :

So long as, a striver assume his affinity for nature, he
holds that he progresses in the mundane sphere through the
performance of actions, while in the spiritual sphere, through
their non-performance. But, in fact, it is not so. As walking and
eating etc., are actions of the physical body, so are reflection
and meditation, the actions of the subtle body and trance, the
action, of the causal body. Therefore, he who performs his duty
(action) for the welfare of the world, by remaining detached
(untainted), sees inaction in action. The same, has been pointed
out, in the forty-eighth verse of the second chapter, by the
Lord, when He declares, ""Perform action, being steadfast in
Yoga (equanimity).""
"
555,"514 $RIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4
' Activity or non-activity with some motive in the world,
are both actions. To remain quite detached, while doing actions
or refraining from them throughout, and being detached, while
there is performance or non-performance of actions,—this total
detachment under all circumstances, is called Yoga’, and is :
'‘Karmayoga.'
A striver should remain equanimous, during the performance
or non-performance of actions, called Karmayoga. -
Question:—Why has the Lord mentioned ‘inaction in action’
and ‘action in inaction’, while in both cases, inaction or detachment, oa
is the predominating factor?
Answer:— When a man sees inaction in action, there remains
the dominance of detachment. But, when he sees action in inaction,
there is predominance of performance or non-performance of -
action. It means, that detachment has its affinity for the self,
while performance or non-performance of actions, has its affinity
for the world, including the body. Therefore, detachment is one's _
own duty, while performance or non-performance of action, is
the duty of another. In order to differentiate the two, the Lord has ;
mentioned ‘seeing inaction in action’ and ‘action in inaction’.
In the Discipline of Action, there is performance or non-
performance of action, for the welfare of the world without |
_ attachment, because, while performing actions, one should remain
detached and while remaining detached, one should perform
actions—these two aspects are the principles of the Gita.
‘Pravrtti’ (activity) and ‘Nivrtti' (non-activity)—both are in
domain of nature. Nature is ever-changing and So is performance
or non-performance of actions, while the Self Which is the
illuminator and base of the two, ever remains uniform without
undergoing any modification. In order to explain this fact, the
Lord has declared, that he who sees inaction in action, and action
in inaction both is wise. It means, that a striver while remaining
established in the self, should perform actions for the welfare of
"
556,"Verse 18] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI. 515
the world viz., as a sacrifice (Yajiia). 7
‘Sa buddhimanmanusyesu'—The striver, who sees inaction in .
action and action in inaction i.e., remains detached (untainted),
and knows the truth about action. Unless he is detached 1.e.,
regards objects and actions as his, and for him, it means that
he has not known the reality about actions.
In order to, know the truth about God, a striver has to
identify the self with Him, while in order to know the reality -
about the world, he has to separate the self from the world
(actions and objects), for he (the self) has identity with God, ee
while he is different from the world. All actions, are transitory
while the self is eternal.
As a common man cannot remain unsoiled, in a coal cellar,
only a wise man could do so, similarly, only a wise man can
remain detached from actions, while performing these. Therefore, ~
here as well as in the tenth verse of the eighteenth chapter, the
Lord calls such a man wise among men. He wants to say that
for such a wise man, nothing further remains to be known. :
| 'Sa yuktah'—A Karmayogl, remains equanimous in success
and failure, because he totally renounces the desire, for the fruit -
of actions. Here the term ' Yoga’, stands for equanimity. One is
a Yogi, because he remains established, in equanimity.
Every being has a natural union with God, but he forgets it, |
because he assumes his affinity for the world. When he performs
actions for the welfare of the world, by renouncing desire for
fruit, a sense of possession and attachment, his assumed affinity
for the world is renounced and he realizes his union with God,
which is natural and eternal. For such a Yogi nothing remains
to be attained, for he has achieved Divinity.
“Krtsnakarmakrt'—So long as, a man has to attain something
or the other, he has to perform actions viz., his attachment for
- actions, does not wither.
Perishable actions bear perishable fruits. So long as, one
"
557,"516 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4 :
has desire for the perishable, he will have to undertake actions.
But, on having renounced all affinity for the perishable, he .
attains to the Imperishable Lord and nothing further remains
to be done. Then, a Karmayogi has nothing to do, with the
performance or non-performance of actions, 1.e., he becomes a 3
performer of all actions. |
When nothing remains to be done, to be known and to
be attained by such a Karmayogi, he is liberated from the _
evil, bondage of the wheel of birth and death in the world |
(Gita 4/16, 32). oe
Appendix—There are two spheres—one of action and the other
of inaction. Out of these two, inaction is the essence. Therefore
he who sees inaction in action viz., while performing an action
remains untainted and he who sees action in inaction viz., while
remaining untainted performs action, for him nothing remains to -
be done, to be known and to be gained. As at the beginning of
an action “GaneSaji’ is worshipped but during the performance
of the action ‘Ganeégaji’ is not worshipped all the time. But it :
is not the case here of remaining untainted in actions at the
beginning only. Therefore the Lord has mentioned inaction in -
action and action in inaction. It means that one should never
be tainted (desire for fruit and the sense of doership) viz., he
should ever remain untainted. :
In the eighth verse of the third chapter the Lord declares
that the performance of an action 1s superior to inaction—‘karma
jyayo hyakarmanah’ while here He declares that it is better to
see inaction (non-doership) than the performance of action; and
for the person who is thus untainted, nothing remains to be done,
to be known and to be gained. It proves that a man should be
free from the desire for fruit and from the sense of doership.
because these two severally bind a man. |
Link:—Now, the Lord in the next two verses, describes the |
"
558,"Verse 19] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 517 .
_ enlightened soul (sage) who sees inaction in action and action -
in inaction, 1.e., who knows the truth about action. .

He, all whose undertakings are free from Sankalpa and desire -
and whose actions are burnt up in the fire of wisdom, him the |
seers, call wise (Pandita). 19 ee
Comment:—
'Yasya sarve samarambhah kamasankalpavarjitah'—Thinking
of sense-objects and remembering these time and again, and
thinking that some of these are good, useful and pleasurable, is a |
mental resolve (Sankalpa) and ""Vikalpa (uncertainty) is antithesis -
of Sankalpa, ""these are not good and are injurious."" This type
of thinking, the Vikalpa-intellect is the abiding place of positive _
and negative projections. When negative projections, give way
to positive ones, at that time a desire to obtain those objects
arises. This is known as ""Kama’. In an accomplished Karmayogi, :
projection and desire, both are absent e.g., there remains neither
‘Sankalpa, which is the origin of desire nor desire which is its
product. Therefore, all actions of a 'Karmayogi' are free from :
resolve and desire.
‘Sankalpa' and desire, are the two seeds of action. If they are
no longer there, action becomes inaction, that is to say, actions
lose their binding potentiality. In a liberated soul, these two
are absent, so actions performed by that are not binding. Even
though, he does everything, in order to maintain social order and
protect the chain of social obligations, yet he is quite untainted
with his actions, whatsoever.
The Lord, has prescribed on occasions the renunciation
of desires (6/4), of mental projections (2/55), and of both
"
559,"518 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4
these (6/24-25). Therefore, wherever in Gita renunciation of :
‘Sankalpa’ is prescribed, it must always be together with desire .
as well. In a nutshell, a striver should give up projections and
desires both. :

There are four states of a motor car. -

1. When a motor car stands still, in the garage, its engine
does not function and the wheels don't move forward.

2. The engine starts functioning, but the wheels do not, -
move forward (it's all loss and no gain).

3. The engine functions and the wheels move and cover - .......
some distance.

4. On a downward slope, the engine is stopped, while the
wheels move and cover a distance (it's all gain and no cost).

Similarly, a man may have four states— |

1. Neither desire, nor action. -

2. Desire but no action (it's all loss and no gain). |

3. Desire as well as action. -

4. Action, but no desire (it's all gain and no cost).

The best state of a motor car is the fourth one, when the car ;
runs, but no petrol is consumed. Similar, is the case with man.

The best state is when he performs action, without having any
desire. Even the wise, call such a man a sage.
'Samarambhah'—Here, this term stands for, the undertaking
of a Karmayogi, which are free from attachment and aversion.
It does not stand for the word 'arambha' (undertaking), used in
the twelfth verse of the fourteenth chapter, because there ‘pravrtti'
(activity) and 'arambha'—two terms have been used. There, the
term 'pravrtti' stands for the performance of duty, while the term
‘arambha’, stands for the undertaking of actions for pleasures
and prosperity. A sage or an enlightened soul, performs action
scrupulously according to the ordinance of the scriptures, for

the welfare of all beings.
The terms 'sarve', expresses the meaning, that all his
"
560,"Verse 19] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 519 -
undertakings are free from the thought of the world and desire. |
From morning till night, whatever he does, for the maintenance of -
his body, such as washing, eating, walking etc., and for spiritual
upliftment, such as chant, adoration, reflection, meditation and
trance, is free, from the thought of the world and desire. .
' Jnanagnidagdhakarmanam'—Wisdom, consists in knowing
the truth that actions have their affinity for the body and the
world, not for the self, because, actions have a beginning and -
an end, while the self remains stable. All actions, are burnt in
the fire of this wisdom i.e., actions cannot bear fruit in the form
of bondage (Gita 4/16,32).
In fact, the body and actions; have their identity with the |
world, while the self is different from these. But, by an error,
he (the self) assumes his affinity for these. Great souls have no
affinity for their so-called, bodies. As actions are performed by -
the entire world, so are actions performed by their so-called,
bodies. Thus, when they are detached from actions, not only ©
their present actions, but also the stock of past actions are burnt, -
in the fire of wisdom. As far as, their fate (prarabdha karma) is
concerned, it creates favourable and unfavourable circumstances, .
but being detached from the fruit of actions they neither feel
happy nor sad. The ‘prarabdha karmas'’, get effaced by creating
transitory circumstances. ,
'Tamahuh panditam budhah'—It is easy to know the reality
about an ascetic, who having renounced actions externally
ever remains absorbed in the adoration of God, but it 1s very
difficult to know the truth about a man living a householder's life
who performs his duty scrupulously without being attached to
actions, in the least. The sages also declare, ""Those who have
renounced the world, enlighten others, and everyone knows them. :
But a householder saint, 1s rarely known.""
As a lotus leaf in spite of being born in water and living
constantly in touch with it, is not tainted by water, so does a
Karmayogi, in spite of being born in a life-of-action (human life)
"
561,"520 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4 ~
and in spite of living, in this world of actions, while performing _
actions, does not get attached to these.* Detachment from actions,  -
_ is not an easy task. Therefore, the Lord, in the eighteenth verse,
: has called him wise among men, while here He declares, that
the wise call him a sage. It means, that such a Karmayogi, is —
the wisest among the. wise.

One having abandoned attachment to actions and their fruit,
ever content, without any kind of dependence, he does nothing -
even though fully engaged in action. 20
Comment:— | | | ;

: 'Tyaktva karmaphalasangam'—lIf a man thinks, that he is the
doer while performing action, regards the body and the senses
etc., as his, considers the action as his and for him and expects :
its fruit, then, he becomes the cause of fruit of action. But an
enlightened soul, totally renounces his affinity for the mundane
materials and so he is not, in the least, attached to materials for |
action, to action and to the fruits of action. Thus, he does not
become the cause of the fruit of action.

As, an army fighting under the guidance of a king, with
material supplied by him gains victory over an enemy, but the
credit for the victory goes to the king; similarly, a soul attached
to the body, senses, mind and intellect etc., is held responsible,
for the fruit of actions performed by these.

* Even Renunciation of actions of a deluded person is conducive to
action while even performance of actions of a wise man leads to actionlessness |
(Astavakra Gita 18/61). |
"
562,"Verse 20] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 521 -

A great soul, having not the least attachment for actions, and
material for actions, is not attached to the fruit of actions. | -

In fact, the self has no attachment for actions and their
fruits, because It is sentient, imperishable and unaltered, while -
actions and their fruits are insentient, perishable and undergo
modifications. But when It assumes Its affinity, by an error, for
them, it is bound. If It renounces this assumed affinity, It will -
realize its detachmemt from actions, and their fruits. : .

""Nirasryah'—Even, a king or an emperor, has to depend on oo
circumstances, time, objects and persons etc. But an enlightened :
soul, does not depend on these, because having realized the self
or God, he remains satisfied in the self, whether he acquires
anything or not. |

'Nityatrptah'—The soul, being a fragment of God is real, and -
the real never ceases to be (Gita 2/16), but when it assumes its
affinity for the unreal, it feels a deficiency. In order to compensate
for the shortage, it has a desire for worldly objects. It is satisfied ;
by acquiring the objects but that satisfaction is temporary as
the objects are perishable. How could the unreal, satisfy the -
real? Therefore, so long as, the soul assumes Its affinity for the
perishable actions and objects, and depends on these, It does not
realize, the satisfaction automatic, which is eternal. The same
eternal satisfaction has been referred in the seventeenth verse of
the third chapter, by the expression ‘atmatrptah' (satisfied with
the self).

'Karmanyabhipravrtto'pi naiva kificitkaroti sah'—The term,
‘'abhipravrttah’ means, that all actions are scrupulously performed |
by emancipated soul, because he is not at all attached to actions
and their fruits. All his actions, are performed for the welfare
of the world.

He who is attached to the fruit of action, cannot perform
actions, scrupulously, because a lot of his energy is wasted, by
thinking of the fruit. : ,
"
563,"522 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4
The term ‘api’ (even or though) means, that such an enlightened
soul does not perform an action at all, though he is fully engaged,
in action. It is because of his detachment, that all his actions
change into inaction. | -
When he does nothing, how could he be bound by the |
fruit of actions? Therefore, the Lord, in the twelfth verse of the
eighteenth chapter, declares that a Karmayogi, who has renounced
the fruit of action, does not reap the fruit of action 1.e., becomes -
free from the bondage of action. : |
Prakrti (nature) is ever-active. Therefore, solongas,aman = —™
has affinity for the modes of nature (actions and objects), he gets
attached to them, even without performing action. If he has no
affinity (attachment) for the modes of nature, he does nothing,
even though, he is ever-engaged in action, as all his actions are -
performed, for the welfare of the world. 7
Appendix—So long as a man has the sense of doership,
during the performance of action or non-performance of action, __
he remains a doer. But when the sense of doership is wiped
out, he does nothing at all or his action or inaction never comes -
under the category of action at all.
Link:—Having described the detachment of an enlightened
soul, in the nineteenth and the twentieth verses, now the Lord,
in the twenty-first verse, describes the detachment of a striver
who does not perform duties enjoined by the scriptures, while,
in the twenty-second verse, He describes the detachment of a
striver, who performs his duties. _ .

incurs no sin. 21

Comment:— ~
'Yatacittaétma'—A man, cannot keep his body, senses, mind and

the self, under control, because of hope or desire. When he has

no hope or desire, his body, senses and mind etc., automatically -

remain under his control, and then no futile action 1s performed

by him. _ |
'Tyaktasarvaparigrahah'— If a Karmayogi is a recluse, he

renounces all worldly possessions. But, if he is a householder,

he does not accumulate any worldly object, to derive pleasure

out of’it. He, by regarding it as the world's, uses it in rendering

service to the world. It is inevitable for every striver not to -

hanker after, mundane pleasure.
[This is the only verse in the whole of Gita, where there -

is description of renunciation, of all worldly possessions. In the

tenth verse of the sixth chapter, there is an explanation of the |

renunciation of possessions, for a Yogi who practises meditation,

while in the fifty-third verse of the eighteenth chapter, there is an

account of the renunciation of possession, for a Yogi, who has /

attained the supreme state of knowledge. But here, in this verse,

renunciation is superior to those renouncements, because only

here, the adjective 'sarva' (all) has been used with 'parigrahah'

(possessions). The term, ‘aniketah' (homeless or having no fixed

abode) has been used, for freedom from attachment to the abode,

in the nineteenth verse of the twelfth chapter, for a Bhaktiyog!.]
‘Nirasih'—A Karmayog], has no hope, no desire and no lust.

He does not hanker after worldly pleasure and prosperity. Even

if, he is not able to renounce his hope or desire totally, he aims

at their renunciation.
'Sarirarn kevalarn karma kurvan'—The actions expressed in
"
565,"524 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter4 ~
this term may be of two kinds— (i) actions which are undertaken |
by the body and, (ii) actions which are performed, for the -
maintenance of the body. The former, have been described, in

the eleventh verse of the fifth chapter, when the Lord declares,
""Men of action having abandoned attachment, perform actions ~—
only with the body, mind, intellect or even with the senses, for the
purification of the self."" But, this verse is pertaining to detachment _
of the striver, who does not even perform duties, enjoined by = -
the scriptures. Therefore, here it is used in the latter sense 1.e.,
actions (as eating, drinking, bathing, washing etc.,) which are oe
necessary, for the bare maintenance of the body, are performed,

by a man of action, who has abandoned attachment. ;

‘Napnoti kilbisam'—He, who 1s attached to the performance
or non-performance of action, in the least, incurs sin 1.e., follows
the cycle of birth and death. But, the man of action, being -
free from hope or desire, is not attached to the performance or
non-performance of action, so he incurs no sin, all his actions -
change into inactions. :

Such a Karmayogi (man of action), does not indulge in ;

indolence and heedlessness. These two are, also enjoyments.
Lying idly in a lonely place is an enjoyment and indulgence in
useless and forbidden actions, is also an enjoyment. Through
such indulgences, a man enjoys himself. Thus he incurs sins.
But a Karmayogi, who is given to performing some action, does
not indulge in indolence and heedlessness. His mind, senses and
body, are under his control. Moreover, he is free from hope, desire
and a sense of possession etc. So, forbidden actions cannot be
performed by him, and thus he incurs no sin. Had he indulged
in indolence and heedlessness in the least, it could not be said
of him, that he incurs no sin.

Now a doubt arises, why it has been said that he incurs no
sin, when forbidden actions cannot be performed by him. The
clarification is, that all undertakings are enveloped by defects
"
566,"| Verse 21] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 525 -

(sins). The Lord declares, ""All undertakings are clouded by defects, .

as fire by smoke"" (Gita 18/48). The root of sins, is desire or a -

sense of mine or attachment. A Karmayogi (man of action), is

free from desire, sense of ‘mine’ and attachment, or he has such

an aim, so he has nothing to do, with the performance or non- ~

performance of action. Therefore, he does not incur incidental

sin, during the performance of his duty, nor does he incur sin,

by the renunciation of his duty, enjoined by the scriptures. -
A second doubt may arise here, that the Lord has directed

even a wise man (who has attained perfection), to perform action ee

for the welfare of the world (3/25-26). The Lord has also declared,

""There is nothing in the three worlds, that should be done by ;

Me, nor is there anything unattained, that should be attained,

yet I engage Myself in action"" (Gita 3/22—-24). Therefore, will

a Karmayogi, who does not engage himself in action for the -

welfare of the world, not incur sin? The clarification is, that he |

will incur no sin, because he is free from desire, attachment etc.,

and a sense of mine. Though the Lord and wise men (enlightened -

souls), are totally free from desire and attachment etc., yet out

of compassion (grace), they perform actions for the welfare of -

the world, even when it is not obligatory for them (Gita 3/18).

Such ascetic-Karmayogis, as described in the verse, are also

ideal for ascetic strivers of Karmayoga and are automatically, a -

source Of inspiration for strivers and common folk.
The third doubt that arises, is that the Lord, in the thirteenth

verse of the third chapter declared, ""Those wicked people who

prepare food for their own sake, verily eat sin"", while here, He

declares that he who performs action for the mere maintenance ~

of body incurs no sin. Thus there seems to be a contradiction.

The clarification is, that so long as there is desire for pleasure

as well as attachment to actions, and materials, he incurs sins,

whether he performs actions or does not perform these, but when

he becomes free from desire and attachment, he incurs no sin.
Question:—Can this verse not be included in the verses
"
567,"526 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 4 -
pertaining to the Discipline of Knowledge, as these reflect the |
marks of a man of knowledge? -
Answer:—The first point is, that here the context is of
Karmayoga. Secondly, a Jani (liberated soul), holds that he
does nothing at all (Gita 5/8) i.e., he sees inaction in action. .
So it cannot be said about him, that he incurs no sin while
performing action, because he does not think he is a doer or he
performs any action at all. ~
Though in the striver, who follows the path of action,
discrimination is not clearly revealed, yet he has a determinate TO
intellect, about three facts, that nothing 1s his, nothing is required
for him, and nothing is to be done for him. Having resolved this, :
he remains detached, from actions in spite of performing these.
Generally, people believe that a Karmayog! leads the life of . _
a householder, while a Jianayogi follows the renounced order.
But, in fact it is not so. A Jiianayogi (man of knowledge) is he,
who can discriminate between self and body, whether he leads -
the life of a householder or of a renounced order. But, he who |
cannot discriminate self from the body, despite a determinate ;
intellect about above-mentioned three facts, is only a Karmayogi,
whether he is a householder or is of a renounced order. :

of profit and loss, and accordingly, he makes wise efforts also.
But, in effect he feels neither happy nor sad. Even if evenness
of mind is lost, a striver, should not lose heart, because the :
disturbance of mind is short-Hved and disappears quickly.
The term ‘labha’ denotes, profit as well as loss, agreeable SO
as well as. disagreeable, whatsoever is obtained.
'Vimatsarah'—A Karmayogi, identifies himself with all.
beings. He realizes his self as the self, in all beings (Gita 5/7).
So he is not at all envious of any being. A Karmayogi, is very -
cautious lest he should be envious of any being, because all
his actions are performed for the welfare of the world. If he is
envious of anyone in the least, his undertakings cannot be for ~
the welfare of the world. : |
Envy is a subtle evil. Even neighbouring businessmen, friends “
and members of a family, are seen getting envious of each other,
because of each other's good fortune. Where, there are antagonistic
feelings, this evil is found in abundance. Therefore, a striver, -
should be on his guard against this evil.
""Dvandvatitah'—A . Karmayogi, transcends the pairs of
opposites, such as profit and loss, honour and dishonour, praise
and blame, pleasure and pain, and desirable and undesirable
circumstances. So, he has a balanced state of mind, free from
attachment and aversion etc. : |
Similarly, there can be the influence of the opposites in
beliefs, one may believe in the Lord, Who is endowed with
form and attributes, while the other may believe in the Lord
Who is formless and without attribute; one may believe in the
dualistic principle, while the other in the non-dualistic principle.
"

Whether mind is absorbed in God or not, whether seclusion is -
procured or not, whether peace is attained or not, and, whether
success is achieved or not, a striver, is free from all such pairs
of opposites, like a balance which remains steady, when there -
is equal weight on either side. A Karmayogi, free from the |
pairs of opposites, is easily released from the bondage of the
world (Gita 5/3). | : -
_ ‘Samah siddhavasiddhau ca'—He remains even-minded in
accomplishment or non-accomplishment of the work and for SC
getting or not getting its fruit in success and failure, pleasure
and pain, without having attachment or aversion for them. The
same evenness. of mind by the expression has been pointed out
here as well as in the forty-eighth verse of the second, chapter.
When a striver realizes, the three facts, that nothing is his, -
nor is for him and nothing is to be done for him, he attains a
state of total evenness of mind.
| 'Krtvapi na nibadhyate'—When a Karmayogi is not bound, ;
even while acting, there is no question of his being bound without
acting. He remains free, from attachment in these two states. -
As a Karmayogi who performs action merely for the
maintenance of the body, is not bound, so is a Karmayogi, who
performs actions, sanctioned by the scriptures, not bound. |
In fact, it is neither performance nor non-performance of
actions, which binds a man but it is attachment to these which
binds him. Similarly, it is detachment, which liberates him from
bondage. A Karmayogi, like an actor, plays his part according
to his caste and order of life and being detached from them.
He is not at all attached to the changing nature (Prakrti), he
remains established in the eternal self.Therefore, he automatically
remains even-minded, and thus is not bound, by actions even
while performing these. |
If a serious thought is given, it becomes clear, that equanimity
is natural. Everyone, knows that he remains the same in both

we commit an error, that.we keep an eye on circumstances, but we

do not watch the Self. Consequently, we feel happy or sad. -

Comment:—

[This verse, is an important one about the Discipline of —
Action, because only here, it is mentioned that all actions of -
a Karmayogi, are destroyed. Similarly, the thirty-sixth verse of
the fourth chapter, is an important verse on the Discipline of
Knowledge, while the sixty-sixth verse of the eighteenth chapter
is an important verse, on the Discipline of Devotion.]

'Gatasangasya'—Attachment, to actions, objects, incidents, |
circumstances and persons, leads to bondage i.e., the cause of
birth of the soul in good and evil bodies (Gita 13/21). When
a man performs actions for the welfare of the world, without
any selfish motive, he becomes free from attachment, for
actions and objects.

In fact, a man (the self) 1s inherently detached, 7
"
571,"530 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4
(Brhadaranyaka 4/3/15). But in spite of being detached, he gets
attached to the body, senses, mind, intellect, objects, circumstances,
and men etc., by regarding these as his own, and is thus bound
by desire for pleasure. So long as, he wants to satiate his desire, .
his attachment is enhanced. In fact, whatever is to happen, will :
happen and whatever is not to happen will not happen, whether
one desires it or not. Therefore, he who has any desire, gets
entangled in vain, and has to suffer pain. -
A Karmayogi, considering the acquired things of the world,
neither of his own nor for himself, utilizes these, in rendering Be
service to the world. Thus the flow of things and actions, is
towards the world and the self remains the same, as it is, |
non-attached. |
He has no egoistic notion of rendering service to others -
because he thinks that he has discharged his debt by returning
thing to the one to whom it belonged. If egoistic notion subsists,
_ it binds a Karmayogt. It subsists only when he considers, the -
materials for service, as his own. When the subtle egoistic notion,
is rooted, then only pure service remains. Moreover, he does not -
expect any reward, in the form of money, honour, praise, position
and authority etc., because he does not lay claim to these. He
wants, neither to be called a generous man, nor gets pleased if
praised by calling him, generous, or derives pleasure out of his
act of service. By doing selfless service, he gets placidity of
mind. If that placidity is not enjoyed, he automatically realizes,
axiomatic detachment. .
""Muktasya'—A man (the soul), in spite of being different, |
from actions and objects, such as the body etc., assumes these as
his own, because of desire, attachment and a sense of mine, and
is thus bound. By following the Discipline of Action, when the
assumed affinity is renounced, the Karmayogi becomes detached.
This detachment leads him to liberation.
' Jnanavasthitacetasah’'—He, who ever remains conscious of
"
572,"Verse 23] ~ SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 531 ;
the self, has his mind ever established in its knowledge. When

he becomes conscious of the self, he gets established in the self. .
In fact, he had already been established in the self, but he only |
now realizes the fact. -

In fact, knowledge is gained of the world, rather than of
the self, because the self is an embodiment of knowledge. The
world, consists of actions and objects. The self, being sentient,
is different from insentient actions and objects. The self is their
illuminator. As soon as, a striver realizes this fact, his affinity
for actions and objects, is renounced and he realizes, that he is, OO
naturally, established in the detached self.

'Yajfayacaratah karma samagram praviliyate'—One form of, |
‘Seeing inaction in action’, is to work for the sake of sacrifice |
(yajnia). Performance of actions for the welfare of others, without _
a selfish motive, is called ‘Yajna’, (sacrifice). He, who works
for the sake of sacrifice, gets liberated, while he, who performs
actions other than those, that are performed for the sake of 7
sacrifice, 1s bound (Gita 3/9).

Actions and objects, are the evolutes of nature (prakrti). Both -
of them have a beginning and an end, i.e., they are perishable.

They neither existed, before they were seen, nor will exist, when

they have gone. It means, that in the middle, they merely seem to
exist, but actually they do not exist, as it is a rule, that whatever

does not exist, at the beginning and at the end, also does not

exist in the middle (at present). But the self, the illuminator of

objects and action, is sentient and remains stable. Though, It has

no affinity for objects and actions, when It assumes its affinity,

for them, it is bound. The method by which to be liberated from

this bondage, is to work for the welfare of others, without having

any selfish desire for fruit.

In the world, there are innumerable objects and undertakings,
which one assumes as his own, by having attachment, desire
and a sense of mine for these he gets bound when having
"
573,"532 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4
renounced attachment, desire and a sense of mine, he renders,
service with them regarding them as of others’, all his actions :
(of past as well as present) are dissolved, and he realizes, his
natural detachment.

(1) An agent, an instrument and action, are the threefold
basis, of action (Gita 18/18). Out of the three, the real basis :
is the agent, because the instrument and the action, depend on
the agent. San

If we give a serious thought to the topic, we come to
realize, that a desire to act, arises, only when we have a desire :
to acquire something, or the other. The desire to act, makes us
an agent, or a doer. This sense of doership, binds a man. When -
a man, performs an action with the desire to acquire anything,
his sense of.doership, is strengthened. But, when a Karmayogi,
without having any desire to acquire anything, works for the sake -
of sacrifice 1.e., for the welfare of others, his doership, is utilized
for the welfare of others and he realizes, that he is detached from ;
actions and objects etc. His actions are not accumulated as in
the absence of doership, all his actions are neutralized.

In the Discipline of Action, renunciation of a sense of mine,
is important, while in the Discipline of Knowledge, renunciation
of 'egoism’', is important. If a striver, renounces one of these, the
other is automatically renounced. In the Discipline of Action, first
there is renunciation of a sense of mine and then renunciation of
egoism, naturally follows; while in the Discipline of Knowledge,
the order is reversed. In absence of ‘I'ness and ‘mineness’, the |
doership and enjoyership, both melt away.

When, a man of action, has neither a sense of doership,
nor has any desire, he has not to reap the fruit of action, in the
same way as a criminal has not to suffer torture or punishment,
if he dies. When a person, does not want to reap the fruit of
"
574,"Verse 23] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 533 :
his actions, all his actions are dissolved.
(2) In the ninth verse of this chapter, the Lord declared, :
""He who thus knows, in their true nature, My divine buth and
action, comes to Me."" The birth, can be divine only of the Lord, .
but actions of men, can also be divine. In the fourteenth verse
of this chapter, the Lord declares, that his actions are divine,
as he has no desire for the fruit of actions and thus, he is not
bound by them 1e., his actions, change into inaction. In this -
way, if a striver, also performs actions, without expecting the
fruit of actions, his actions also, change into inaction. Then, — ne
in the fifteenth verse, He declares, ""Having known this, men
who sought liberation, also performed actions.” In the sixteenth :
verse, He resolves to teach the reality about action, while in the |
seventeenth verse, He declares that one should understand the
true nature of action, of forbidden action and of inaction. In, the -
eighteenth verse, He declares, that he who see inaction in action
and action in inaction, ls wise among men. :
Desire is the known root of actions. When desire is, enhanced,
forbidden actions are performed, but when desire is renounced, .
actions are changed into inaction. The main purpose of the Lord,
is to describe inaction, (from the sixteenth to the thirty-second
verse). Therefore, He has described renunciation of desire, which
is the root of actions and forbidden actions in each of the verses :
from the nineteenth to the twenty-third, along with inaction* and
the topic has been concluded in the thirty-second verse.
* Examples of the renunciation of desires— ‘Devoid of desires’ (4/19);
“Having abandoned attachment to the fruit of action” (4/20); ""Having no hope or
desire"" (4/21); ""Satisfied with what comes to him by chance"" (4/22) and ""Devoid
of attachment” (4/23).
Examples of inaction—
""Actions have been burnt by the fire of knowledge” (4/19); "" He does
nothing thought engaged in action"" (4/20); ""While performing actions he incurs
no sin"" (4/21); ""Though acting he is not bound"" (4/22); "" The whole action is
dissolved"" (4/23).
"
575,"534 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4
Appendix—-One is ‘Kriya’, one is ‘Karma’ and one is
“Karmayoga’. The body passes from babyhood to youth and ~—

from youth to old age—this is ‘kriya’. By this ‘Kriya’ a man

neither incurs sin nor virtue, it neither leads him to salvation |

nor to bondage. Similarly the flow of the river Ganges is mere __

a ‘kriya’. If a man gets drowned in its current or it may prove

helpful in farming etc., the Ganges does not incur any sin or

virtue. When a man by assuming affinity with ‘kriya’ becomes —

a doer viz., he does ‘kriya’ for himself, then this ‘kriya’ bears

fruit and it becomes ‘Karma’ (action). Karma leads to bondage— we

‘yajnarthatkarmano’nyatra loko’ yarn karmabandhanah’ (Gita 3/9).

In order to be free from the bondage of actions, when a man |

does nothing for himself but works for the welfare of others in a

disinterested way, it is “Karmayoga’. By Karmayoga bondage for

actions is destroyed—‘yajiiayacaratah karma samagrarh praviliyate’. -

With the annihilation of bondage ‘yoga’ is attained viz., eternal

union with God is realized. 7
This twenty-third verse is the main verse of Karmayoga. As

the Lord by the expression “jnanagnih sarvakarmani bhasmasat -

_ kurute’ (Gita 4/37) has declared that the fire of knowledge reduces

all actions to ashes and by the expression ‘aharh tva sarvapapebhyo

moksayisyami ma Sucah’ (18/66) He has declared He will liberate |

a devotee from all sins, similarly in this verse He has declared

by the expression ‘yajnayacaratah karma samagrarh praviliyate’

that all the actions including past ones of a karmayogi melt away.
Link:—In the preceding verse, the Lord declared, ""All actions |

of a man, who works for the sake of sacrifice, are dissolved.""

The term ‘sacrifice’, in this context, stands for duty, according

to a person's caste and order of life etc. Therefore, the Lord,

in the next seven verses, explains several forms of sacrifice as

duties, for the strivers, according to their inclination, faith and

qualification. —

By God, as offeror of sacrifice, is the oblation poured into the fire ~
of God. God shall be attained by him who is absorbed in God, in |

Comment:—
{Oblation, is important in sacrifice. The oblation becomes one .
with fire, when it is poured into fire, it has no separate existence
of its own. Similarly, when all the means of God-realization, |
have no existence apart from God, these become sacrifice. -
To perceive, God in all sacrifices, is to see reality, as it is
not a conception. Actually objects are not real, and to visualize -
these as real, is an error. |
All, the sacrifices described, from the twenty-fourth verse .
to the thirtieth verse, are included in 'Karmayoga’, because the
Lord at the beginning of this context, declared, ""I shall teach
thee, what action is (the nature of action and inaction), knowing =
which, thou shalt be delivered from evil"" (4/16). At the end, He
declared, ""Know all sacrifices as born of action, and thus knowing,
thou shalt be liberated"" (4/32). In the middle, also He declared,
“To one who works for the sake of sacrifice, the whole action
is dissolved"" (4/23). The important factor, is that all actions
of a person, who performs them for the sake of sacrifice, are
changed into inaction. Therefore, in all these sacrifices, there is
a description of, inaction in action.] :
‘Brahmarpanam brahma havih’—The ladle, with which an
oblation is poured into the fire, has been called 'arpanam'—
that is God.
"

Sesame seed, barley and ghee, which are poured as oblation _

so ‘Brahmagnau brahmand hutam'—He, who performs the. —

poured, is God and the act of pouring oblation, is also God.

""Brahmakarmasamadhina—Just as person while offering

Cultured people, recite this verse while having meals, so that
this activity may be changed into a sacrifice (yajia). When a= -
striver has his meal, he beholds God, in the following way:—

(1) The hand, with which the food is put into the mouth, isGod.
""With hands and feet everywhere, He exists"" (Gita 13/3).

(11) The food is God. ""I am the melted butter"" (Gita 9/16).

_ (iii) He who eats the food, is also God. ""The soul is a
fragment of Mine"" (Gita 15/7).

(iv) The fire, that abides in the stomach, and by which food
is digested, is also God. ""I am the fire, lodged in the body of
all creatures"" (Gita 15/14). .

(v) The action of offering food, to the fire, which abides in
the stomach, is also God. ""I am the offering"" (Gita 9/16).

(vi) The fruit of eating, the remnants, (residual food) of the
sacrifice, is also God. ""Those who eat the sacred food that remains,
after a sacrifice, attain to the eternal Absolute"" (4/31).

The world, which is an evolute of nature (prakrti), is in
fact, seen in the form of objects and actions. The world, in the
"
578,"Verse 25} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 537 :
form of objects and actions is ever-changing and ever undergoes
modifications. But, due to attachment, we do not perceive the
changing nature, of objects; we perceive these chiefly, as objects.
All objects and activities are going to naught. Therefore, the -
world is practically, a naught. There is existence, only of the
transcendental Absolute. In fact the world does not exist, but it ,
seems to exist, in the light of the eternal Absolute. The non-
existence of the world is explained below— a ;
The world appears in three states—birth, life and death.

Some Yogis offer sacrifice to God alone; while others offer
the self as sacrifice by the sacrifice of discrimination in the fire
of the Supreme. 25
Comment:—
'Daivamevapare yajiiam yoginah paryupasate'—In the
preceding verse, the Lord described, a striver who beholds God,
"
579,"538 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4
in all objects and actions. Here, by using the term ‘apare' He

: describes strivers, who perform sacrifice, but who are different ;
from those mentioned, in the preceding verse.

Here the term 'Yoginah’, stands for those strivers, who -
perform actions, without expecting any reward. .
Those who instead of regarding actions and objects as theirs
and for them, regard these as the Lord's and for Him, perform = _
sacrifice to God, as He is the Lord, even of the gods. Therefore, :
those persons who, without having the least attachment, a sense j |

of mine and desire for objects and actions, hold that they are
only of the Lord, perform sacrifice to Him.

""Brahmagnavapare yajiiam yajiienaivopajuhvati'—The term
‘apare’, has been used, to bring out the distinction between sacrifice
mentioned in the first half of this verse, and the second half. -

When, the soul identifies Itself with matter, It becomes an
embodied soul. But when a person (the soul), by discrimination, _
having a total disinclination for matter, merges in God i.e., has not
the least separate existence, apart from God, it is called sacrifice.

Appendix—The expression ‘brahmagnavapare yajfiamn
yajnenaivopajuhvati’ may also mean other Yogis in order to
serve Brahma—the embodied world perform duty sacrifice for
the sacrifice in the form of welfare of others viz., they perform |
all actions for the welfare of others (Gita 3/9, 4/23).

Some offer hearing and other senses, as sacrifice into the fire
of restraint; others offer sound and other objects of senses into
the fire of senses. 26
"
580,"Verse 27] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 539 -
Comment:—

Srotradinindriyanyanye sarnyamagnisu juhvati'—Here, the offer
of senses, into the fires of restraint has been called, sacrifice. It
means that some do not allow the senses—ear, eye, skin, tongue, /
and nose, to incline towards the sensual objects of sound, sight,
touch, taste and smell. They constantly restrain their senses.

The senses, the mind, the intellect and the ego, are said to
be under complete restraint, when these are totally free, from
attachment (Gita 2/58-59, 68). 7

'Sabdadinvisayananya indriyagnisu juhvati'—Sound, sight,
touch, taste and smell, are the five sensual objects. The discipline
in which these objects of sense, are offered in the fire of sense,
becomes a sacrifice. It means, that even when the objects of :
senses, come in contact with senses, the senses remain free from -
attraction and repulsion, or attachment and aversion (Gita 2/64-65).

In both the sacrifices, mentioned in this verse, perfection ;
or God-realization, is attained, when there is total absence of
attachment. This process, of two kinds as sacrifice, has been
described, in order to root out attachment. -

In the first one, a striver controls his senses in solitude,
through discrimination, chant and meditation etc. When there is full
restraint, he becomes, free from attachment and then he remains 7
equable, both in loneliness, as well as in practical life.

In the second case, a striver in his practical life, moves about
among sense-objects with the mind, intellect and ego and the
senses, free from attraction and repulsion i.e., attachment and
aversion. When he becomes free from attachment, he remains
the same, both in loneliness and practical life.

Some others again, offer sacrifice with the functions of the

senses and those of the breath (vital energy), into the fire of Yoga

of self restraint, kindled by knowledge. 27 : |

Comment:—

'‘Sarvanindriyakarmani pranakarmani capare'—In this verse,

a trance (concentration of the mind on God or the self), has

been called a form of sacrifice. It means, that in the state of

trance, when the Yogi concentrates his mind on God, his senses = =

(sense-organs and organs of action), cease to function, these

become calm.

When a Yogi concentrates his mind on God, the function

of the breath, is offered (sacrificed) 1.e., the breath also ceases _

to function. In the state of trance, breath ceases to function, in

two ways—the first, is by breath-control, in which breath is

suspended. By practice, it can be suspended for hours and thenfor —-

days, together. By this process of restraining breath, the duration

of life is lengthened, in the same way, as the age of a frog is __

lengthened. When it rains, sand also flows with water. A frog 1s

embedded by that sand. When the sand dries, the frog remains
there and its breath ceases to function. But when it rains again
next year, in the rainy season, it comes back to life.

In the second way, the mind is concentrated on God or

the self, and when the mind is totally concentrated, breathing

automatically stops. :

' Jiianadipite'—Both, the trance and sleep, have their affinity

for the causal body. Therefore, both of these appear to be of

the same state. Here, by the expression “jnanadipite (kindled by

knowledge), the Lord explains, that there is a vast difference

between the two. In the state of trance, the knowledge that God
pervades everywhere, remains kindled, while during slumber all

his inclinations merge 1n ignorance. During trance, breath ceases

to function while during slumber, breath functions. In slumber,
no trance is possible. | -
‘Atmasarhyamayogagnau juhvati'—The Yogis, who
concentrate their mind, sacrifice all the functions of senses and -
those of the breath, into the fire of the Yoga of self-restraint i.e., :
having suspended the function, of all the senses, breath, mind
and intellect, they get fixed in trance. In that state, all senses
and breath cease to function and the consciousness of God who -
is All Truth-Knowledge-Bliss, remains fully awakened.

eulogized, in the scriptures. The aim of these vows is, to enable
a man to have disinclination for the world. The expression
‘SarmnSitavratah’ (persons of rigid vows), has been used for the
strivers, who fulfil these vows. Besides them, other strivers who
perform the vows of the four other kinds of sacrifice, mentioned
in the verse, are also persons of rigid vows. They have been
called 'Yatayah' (persons of self-restraint), because they having
self-restraint, make efforts, in performing the sacrifice of their
own choice and taste. |

the welfare of others, without any selfish motive, by regarding

sacrifice, a man does not need to use anything more, than what

he actually possesses. As a person, expects a child to perform, |

only the action which he is capable of performing, so does the

omniscient Lord, and the world expect us to perform sacrifice, _

which we are capable of performing. : |
'Tapoyajiiah'—'Tapoyajnah' (austerity as sacrifice), consists in

facing difficult and unfavourable circumstances, happily. Observing 7

fast and keeping mum, etc., are also austerities, as sacrifice. But,.

the best sacrifice, consists in the performance of one's duty happily,

even in the most unfavourable circumstances,without the least

deviation from it. Such austerity, proves fruitful quickly. :
Rubbish may be harmful for health, but it works as a manure in

farming. Similarly, unfavourable circumstances, work as austerity,

if the striver faces these happily. A man feels happy in favourable

circumstances and feels unhappy in unfavorable circumstances,

because of his attachment to pleasure. If he is not attached to

pleasure, he can understand, the merit of unfavourable circumstances. :
""Yogayajiiastathapare'—Here, the term ‘Yoga’, stands for

equanimity. Evenness of mind in success and failure, praise and

blame, honour and dishonour and pleasure and pain, is called

""Yogayajiia’ (Yoga as sacrifice). In this sacrifice, a striver has

neither attachment for favourable circumstances, nor aversion

for unfavourable circumstances.
"
584,"Verse 29-30] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 543
'Svadhyayajiianayajiiah'—Study of the scriptures, such as the
Gita, the Ramayana, the Bhagavata, the Vedas and the Upanisad
etc., as well as, the study of one’s own self and inclinations—all
constitute, the holy sacrifice of knowledge. :
The Lord, while explaining the merit of the study of Gita
declares, ""He who studies this sacred dialogue (the Gita) of :
ours, by him, I would be worshipped through the sacrifice of .
knowledge"" (Gita 18/70). It means, that the study of Gita is :
a sacrifice of knowledge. He, who is lost in reflection, of the _
gospel of the Gita and makes efforts to understand it, performs ee
the sacrifice of knowledge.

Others offer as sacrifice (yajiia), the outgoing breath in the

breaths (pranayama). Others who regulate their diet, could offer
the breath of life to the vital air (prana). All these are knowers
of yajiia and by that have their sins destroyed. 29-30
Comment:—
‘Apane juhvati pranam prane'panam tathapare pranapanagati
ruddhva pranayamaparayanah'*—Heart is the abode of outgoing
* In this verse is one subject, ‘others’ and one verb, ‘sacrifice’ therefore, here
restraint of birth includes inhalation, retention and exhalation of breath.
"
585,"544 , SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4
breath, while the seat of incoming breath, is anus. The Yogis, -
practise inhalation through the left nostril. That air having taken
the life-air which abides in the heart with it, passing through the |
navel merges with the incoming breath. This is called 'Puraka’ :
(Inhalation). When the outgoing and the incoming breaths, are
restrained, it is called 'Kumbhaka’' (retention of breath). After
that, the air from inside is exhaled through the right nostril. .
That air, having taken the outgoing and the incoming breaths, is
exhaled. This is, sacrifice of the outgoing breath, in the incoming
breath. It is called 'recaka' (exhalation). Inhalation is practised OO
by uttering the name of the Lord four times, while retention, of
breath is practised by uttering the same name, sixteen times, and
exhalation, is practised by uttering the same name eight times.
Thus Yogis, through the left nostril, practise inhalation, -
retention of breath and exhalation and then, through the right
nostril practise inhalation, retention of breath and exhalation.
Repetition of this process, is known as the sacrifice of restraint of -
the breath. When restraint of breath is practised, in order to attain
God, without expecting any other reward, all sins perish. -
‘Apare niyataharah prananpranesu juhvati'—Only those
strivers, who regulate their diet can offer as sacrifice their
life-breaths (prana) for life-breaths. He who eats too much or ,
abstains too much from eating, cannot practise this restraint, of
breath (Gita 6/16-17). oo :
The sacrifice of life-breaths (prana) by life-breaths means,
sacrifice of the incoming breath into the incoming breath and
of the outgoing breath, into the outgoing breath, 1e., the acts
of inhalation and exhalation, both are suspended. This is called
‘Stambhavrtti pranayama’ (absolute restraint of the breath). Through
this restraint of the breath, passions are naturally controlled and
sins are destroyed. When this sacrifice is practised, with the aim
of God-realization, it leads to the purification of the mind and
then to God-realization. :
"
586,"Verse 29-30] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 545 -

'‘Sarve'pyete yajiiavido yajiiaksapitakalmasah'—The expression
‘sarve'pyete’ (all these), has been used for those strivers, who ""
perform sacrifice (duties), as described from the twenty-fourth
verse to the first half of the thirtieth verse. Performance of
these sacrifices, destroys their sins, and leads them to god- -
realization. |

In fact all sacrifices aim at the renunciation of affinity, for
actions. Those, who know this fact, are the real knowers of -
sacrifice. When affinity for actions, is totally renounced, God is
realized. Those who perform sacrifice, instead, for God-realization, nnn
for acquiring pleasure here as well as hereafter, do not know, the
reality about sacrifice. It is desire for the perishable pleasures, :
which leads to bondage. The Lord declares, ""Those who seek
worldly enjoyment repeatedly go and return"" (Gita 9/21). Therefore, -
those who perform, even great sacrifices with worldly desires,
have to follow the bondage, of birth and death. :

|

During sacrifice, oblation is offered into fire. The oblation has ;
different shapes, It loses its identity and becomes one with the fire.
Similarly, when all the means of God-realization, which have been
described here as sacrifice, are offered to God, these lose their /
identity, and become one with God. If these retain their separate
existence, it means, that they have not been offered, as sacrifice.

The Lord, started this topic of the reality of actions, (seeing
inaction in action), from the sixteenth verse. The reality about
actions is, that he who performs actions as sacrifice i.e., for
the welfare of others, is not bound by them. As everything put
into fire is burnt to ashes, so are actions, which are performed
for the sake of sacrifice, dissolved entirely i.e., are reduced to
nothing (Gita 4/23).

Day to day actions, performed for the welfare of others, without
any selfish motive, lead to God-realization. But, even virtuous
"
587,"5.46 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA - {Chapter4 -

actions, performed with a selfish motive (with the expectation
of their fruits) cannot lead to God-realization, because it is a -
desire for the perishable, which binds a man. So long as, he
assumes his affinity for the world,.1in the form of its materials
and actions, he has attachment to acquire something and to do .
something. This attachment, is called a desire to acquire and
an ‘urge to act’. |

In fact, the real desire (need) of a man is, to attain God whose -
fragment, he is. But, he wants to satisfy this need by acquiring
worldly objects because of his inclination for the world and Tn enn
disinclination for God. How can, the perishable objects satisfy the
imperishable fragment (the self) of the Lord? So long as, he has
an inclination for the world, he has a desire to acquire something
or the other. In order to, acquire it, he has to act. Thus, so long |
as, he has a desire to acquire and an urge to act viz., he has -
affinity with materials and actions, he has to follow, the cycle
of birth and death. How to get liberated from this cycle? One -
can be liberated from, this cycle of birth and death, when one
performs actions for the welfare of others, without having any
desire. This is called sacrifice or an ideal for others, or actions :
for the welfare of others.

When actions, are performed for the welfare of others, the -
affinity for the world is renounced, and a man gets detached
from these. If actions are performed for the sake of the Lord,a
striver's affinity, for the world is renounced, he gets detached from
actions, and he attains devotion to God which is an uncommon
trait, of a striver.

Appendix—Performance of actions without any selfish motive,
only for the welfare of others is called ‘yajfia’ (sacrifice). By
sacrifice all actions are transformed into inaction viz., they don’t
lead to bondage. There is mention of twelve kinds of sacrifice
from the twenty-fourth verse to the thirtieth verse and they are
as follows— .
"
588,"Verse 29-30] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 547

(i) Brahmayajna—Realizing the doer, the action, the
instrument and object etc., in every action as Brahma. -

(ii) Bhagavadarpanarupa yajiia—Assuming all actions and
objects only God’s and only for Him. | |

(iii) Abhinnataripa yajfia—Having total disinclination for :
the unreal, merger in God viz., having no independent existence
of one’s own apart from God.

[Kartavya-karmaripa yajfia—performance of all actions for -
the welfare of others. ]

(iv) Sathyamarupa yajna—In loneliness not to allow the OO
senses to incline mentally towards the sensual objects.

(v) Visaya-havanarupa yajiia—tIn day to day life to keep the |

senses free from attachment and aversion even when the senses
come in contact with sense-objects (Gita 2/64-65). _

(vi) Samadhirupa yajiia—By restraining all the functions
of the senses and breath to get established in trance kindled by |
knowledge. | :

(vii) Dravya yajiia—Utilization of all materials for the service
of others in a selfless spirit. -

(viii) Tapoyajiia—Facing difficulties happily while discharging
one’s duty. |

(ix) Yogayajfiia—To remain equanimous in success and |
failure, in favourable and unfavourable circumstances. |

(x) Svadhyayarupa jnanayajia—Study of the sacred
scriptures and chanting the Lord’s holy names etc., for the
good of others.

(x1) Pranayamaripa yajia—Control of breaths by ‘puraka’
(inhalation), ‘Kumbhaka’ (retention) and ‘recaka’ (exhalation).

(xii) Stambhavrtti (fourth) pranayamaripa yajna—By
regulating the diet, suspension of the acts of inhalation and
exhalation. | |

All these mean that all our actions should be performed
"
589,"548 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4
in the form of sacrifice and then our life will be successful. It |
means that we have to do nothing for ourselves. We have no -
affinity for actions and objects. We have relationship with God

Who is devoid of actions and objects. |

Link:—The Lord, from the twenty-fourth verse to the first half
of the thirtieth verse, described twelve kinds of sacrifice, while -
in the second half of the thirtieth verse, He eulogized strivers ,
who perform sacrifices. Now, He in the next verse, explains what
is gained, through their performance and what is lost through ee
their non-performance.

yajnhasistamrtabhujo yanti brahma_  sanatanam

nayam loko'styayajiiasya kuto'nyah kurusattama

Those who partake sacred remnants after a sacrifice (yajna),
attain to the eternal Absolute; even this world is not pleasant for
him who performs no sacrifice; how then can he have happiness -
in any other world, O Best of the Kurus (Arjuna)? 31
Comment:—

'Yajiiasistamrtabhujo yanti brahma sanatanam'—Those, ;
who realize equanimity, having performed sacrifice 1.e., having
performed duty without any selfish motive, are said to have taken
the remnants of the sacrifice. Such people, are released from all
sins, and attain to the eternal Absolute (Gita 3/13).

A man (the self), is eternal. It 1s because of his attachment
to the perishable, that he believes that he dies. When he, having
utilized his so-called possessions, for the welfare of the world, gets
detached from them, he realizes the fact, that he is eternal.

When action is performed as duty i.e., for the welfare of
others without any selfish motive, it becomes a sacrifice (yajna).
"
590,"Verse 32] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 549 -
Action performed, with a selfish motive leads to bondage. In a
sacrifice all possessions offered to others; for his own-self, he ""
performs only action, which is inevitable for the bare maintenance
of body (Gita 4/21). Such an action, is also included in sacrifice.
This human body has been bestowed upon us, so that we may -
perform sacrifice. If we use it, in order to gain honour, praise,
comforts and luxuries etc., it leads us to bondage. But, if with
it, actions are performed only for the sake of sacrifice, it leads
to liberation and one attains to the Eternal Absolute. |

‘Nayam loko'styayajiiasya kuto'nyah kurusattama'—In the een
eighth verse of the third chapter, the Lord declared, ""Even the
maintenance of the body would not be possible by inaction."" :
Similarly, here He declares, ""This world 1s not felicitous for him who
performs no sacrifice, how then can he have happiness in, any other |
world?"" He, who performs actions, with a selfish motive disturbs -

_ peace, causes disorder and strife, and does not attain salvation.

A selfish member, who does not perform his duty, is not
liked even by members of one's family. Non-performance of
duty, causes quarrels, strifes and annoyance in the family. He
who wants to lead a peaceful life in the family, should perform
his duty by rendering service to other members of the family.
By doing so, he becomes a source of inspiration for others and
thus unity and peace prevail, in the family and in the world, :
here as well as hereafter. On the other hand, he who does not
perform his duty scrupulously, does not lead a happy life, here
as well as hereafter.

Thus, many forms of sacrifice have been described in

detail in the Vedas. Know them all as born of action and

having known these as such thou shalt be liberated from the -

bondage of action. 32

Comment:—

'Evamn bahuvidha yajiia vitata brahmano mukhe'—Besides, the
' twelve forms of sacrifice, which have been described, from the

twenty-fourth verse to the thirtieth verse, there are many other ~ :

forms of sacrifice, which have been explained in detail, in the

Vedas. The reason is, that according to their inclination, nature :

and faith, strivers, follow different spiritual disciplines. —

In the Vedas, there is description of self-centred rituals _
which people perform, in order to reap their perishable fruit.

So, they go to heaven and enjoy divine pleasures of the gods,

there. But, having enjoyed them, when fruits of their virtuous -

deeds are exhausted, they return to the world of mortals, and

these follow, the cycle of birth and death (Git& 9/21). Self- .

centred rituals, are not enunciated here. But, here 1s an outline

of selfless sacrifice, by performing which a striver attains to the

Eternal Absolute (Gita 4/31). | |
In the Vedas, there is not only the description of the means |

of enjoying heavenly pleasures, but there is also reference to |

spiritual practice, such as hearing of Vedic texts, cognition

(reflection on what is heard), constant musing (constant and

profound meditation), restraint of breath and trance (super

conscious state), as the means of God-realization. These have

been mentioned here, in this verse. |
In the fourteenth and the fifteenth verses of the third

chapter, the Lord declares, ""Sacrifice is born of the Veda, and

the omnipresent God, ever abides in sacrifice we should resort

to such sacrifice, only for God-realization.""
"
592,"Verse 32] _ SADHAKA-SANJIVANT 551
'Karmajanviddhi tansarvan'—The expression, 'tansarvan’ (the .

all) has been used, for all the twelve sacrifices, described from

the twenty-fourth to the thirtieth verse here, as well as, different

forms of sacrifice described in the Vedas. -
The expression 'Karmajanviddhi' (born of action) means, that

all forms of sacrifice are born of actions. Activities undertaken

with the body, words uttered with the mouth and thoughts of the

mind, are all included, in actions. The Lord declares, ""Whatever |

action a man performs, that is undertaken by the body, speech ee

or mind” (Gita 18/15). :
Arjuna, wants to attain salvation, but he wants to renounce .

his duty of fighting, by regarding it, as a sin. Therefore, the -

Lord by using the expression 'Karmajanviddhi', explains to him,

that whatever spiritual practice he will do by renouncing war, ~

will also be, the performance of action. The Lord declares, that

it is not action, but total renunciation of affinity for actions, -

which leads to salvation. Therefore, he should perform his duty

of fighting, remaining detached from actions, in order to attain

salvation, because it is not actions but it is attachment to them, :

which binds him (Gita 6/4). It is also easy for him to perform

the duty of fighting, because it is his natural or innate duty

(specific duty). | -
'Evarn jiiatva vimoksyase'—-The Lord, in the fourteenth

verse of this chapter, declared, ""I have no desire for the fruit

of actions. So actions do not bind me. He who knows Me thus,

is not bound by actions."" It means, that he who has learnt the

art of remaining detached from actions, while performing these

and translates it into practice, gets liberated from the bondage

of actions. The same fact, has been pointed out by the Lord,

- in the fifteenth verse, when He declares, ""Having known thus,

the actions were performed by those ancient men, who sought

liberation."" In the sixteenth verse, He promised to explain the true

nature of action and inaction, by knowing which, he would be
"
593,"552 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4
liberated from the cycle of birth and death. In the present verse, -
He concludes the topic, by declaring that, having known thus,
he will be liberated. It means, that when a person performs his
duty, only for the welfare of the world. without expecting any -
_ fruit, he is liberated from the bondage of actions.
In the world, innumerable actions are performed, but a man
is bound only by those with which he establishes his affinity. By
having this affinity, he gets pleased or displeased, and thus he is sy
bound by those actions. But when he renounces his affinity, for
the body and actions, he is liberated, from the bondage of actions. SO

has a curiosity to know which one of the sacrifices is superior to

Knowledge, as a sacrifice (yajiia) is superior to any material
sacrifice, O harasser of the foes (Arjuna). All actions and objects
in their entirety, culminate in knowledge (jfiana). 33 :
Comment:— a |
'Sreyandravyamayadyajiiajjiianayajiiah parantapa'— Sacrifices,
which require material objects and actions, are called ‘Dravyamaya’.
The suffix ‘Maya’ with the term 'Dravya’, denotes large quantity. |
As with the preponderance of earth the earthenpot is called 744
so with the preponderance of material the sacrifice is called
material sacrifice. Knowledge as a sacrifice, is superior to any
material sacrifice, because in knowledge-sacrifice, there is no
need for material objects and actions.
The Lord, declares that all sacrifices are born of
"
594,"Verse 33] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 553 .
action (4/32). But here He declares, that all actions culminate
in knowledge i.., knowledge as a sacrifice, is not born of -
actions but is born of discrimination. Therefore, knowledge, as a
Sacrifice, mentioned here, does not stand for knowledge, as ;
sacrifice (described in 4/28). It stands for the process of acquiring :
knowledge from teachers, who are well-versed in the scriptures,
as will be described in the thirty-fourth verse. Material sacrifice,
described here, stands for the twelve forms of sacrifice already :
described. Having performed material sacrifice, the knowledge-
sacrifice, 1s offered. If we consider minutely, we come to know TO
_ that knowledge-sacrifice is also born of actions, but in knowledge-
sacrifice, there is predominance of discrimination.
‘Sarvam karmakhilam. partha jane parisamapyate'—The
terms 'sarvam' and ‘akhilam’, both are synonyms. Therefore, the _
expression ‘Sarvarn karma’ should mean, all actions, while the
word '‘akhilam' would stand for, all material objects. | :
So long as, a man performs actions for himself, he has affinity -
for them, and consequently his mind remains impure. But, when
he does not perform them for himself, his mind is purified. .
The mind is tainted by three kinds of defects—sins, volatility
of mind, and ignorance. When a striver performs actions, for
the welfare of others without any selfish motive, his first two
defects i.e., sins and volatility of mind, come to an end. In order a
to get rid of the third defect, having renounced actions, he goes
to his preceptor, so that he may impart knowledge, to him. At
that time, he does not aim at actions and material objects, but
his aim is God-realization. This is known, as culmination of all
actions and material objects, in knowledge 1.e., God-realization
through the attainment of true knowledge.
In the scriptures, there are eight inward spiritual means to
attain knowledge. These are —(1) Discrimination. (2) Dispassion. .
"
595,"554 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4 -
(3) Six traits (Quietism, self-control, piety, indifference, endurance |
and composure). (4) Desire to attain salvation. (5) Listening to -
Vedantic texts. (6) Cognition. (7) Constant and deep meditation.
(8) Self-realization. : ,

Discrimination (viveka), consists in distinguishing, the
real from the unreal. Renunciation of the unreal or having a
disinclination for the world is called dispassion (vairadgya).
Deviation of the mind from the sense object is quietism (Sama). -
Control over the senses is 'dama'. Reverence for God and the
scriptures is called 'piety' (Sraddha). Total resignation from the oe ean
world, is 'Uparati’. Forbearance in the pairs of opposites such as heat
and cold, is endurance (Titiksa). Freedom from doubt is composure :
(Samadhana). The desire for salvation, is called 'Mumuksuta.

When desire for salvation, is aroused, a striver having -

renounced material objects and actions, goes to a learned God-

realized preceptor. He hears the Vedantic texts, which remove his
doubts, which is known as hearing ( Sravana). Then, he thinks -
of the reality, about God which is known cognition (Manana).
If he holds that the world is real and God does not exist— this ;
is an Opposite conception. Removal of this contrary conception,
is called constant and profound meditation (Nididhyasana).
When, having renounced affinity for all material objects, one ;
gets established in the self, it is called self-realization (tattvarh
padartha sarnsodhana).* |

In fact, all these spiritual disciplines are practised, in order
to renounce the affinity for the unreal. That which is renounced,
is not for one's own self, but the result of renunciation (God-
realization), is for one's own self.

Appendix—In ‘Dravyamaya yajia’ (material sacrifice),
there is predominance of material objects and actions; therefore

* Those who hanker after worldly pleasures and prosperity hear the Vedantic
texts, think over the sense-objects, have a constant and profound meditation on
riches and attain pains and sorrows.
"
596,"Verse 34] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 555

it is “Karana sapeksa’ (dependent on sense & other organs).

In Jianayajiia (Knowledge-sacrifice) there is predominance of -

discrimination. Therefore it is ‘Karana nirapeksa (independent

of sense and other organs). Therefore knowledge as sacrifice .

is superior to material sacrifice. In Jiianayajiia, affinity for all

actions and objects is renounced viz., after God-realization nothing

remains to be done, to be known and to be attained because no

other existence remains except God. /

Comment:—
'Tadviddhi'—Arjuna, in the beginning declared, ""I don't foresee

any good by slaying my own people, in the fight"" (Gita 1/31)

and ""Only sin will accrue to us, if we kill these malignants""

(Gita 1/36). He also declared, ""It is better to live in this

world, even by begging, than to slay these honoured teachers""

(Gita 2/5). Thus, according to Arjuna, it 1s better to renounce

fighting, which is his duty, rather than to fight. But, according

to Lord Krsna, it is not necessary to renounce actions in order

to gain knowledge (wisdom) (Gita 3/20; 4/15). Therefore, it

seems that the Lord, warns Arjuna that if he, because of his
"
597,"556 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4 -
lack of faith in Him, does not believe in what He preaches, he
should go to a wise preceptor, who has realized the truth and -
he would impart him the knowledge of self-realization, through
the traditional practice of knowledge.*
The Lord further, in the thirty-eighth verse, declares, ""Through :
the constant practice of the Discipline of Action, a striver without
any other spiritual practice, attains the knowledge of the self.
He needs no help from others. .
'‘Pranipatena'—He should go to a teacher, with profound
humility and perfect devotion, and through prostration surrender BO
himself, his body and possessions etc., to him. He should be
very submissive and very cautious, that in no way disrespect :
is meted out to a preceptor. He should keep his inquisitiveness
always, awake. -
'Sevaya'—He should render service to his preceptor, with
his body and objects and try to please him, by carrying out his
orders and acting, according to his wish. -
A striver, renders the greatest service to the saints (great
souls) by translating their principles into practice, because their -
principles are more dear to them, than even their bodies. They
remain prepared to sacrifice their life, in order to protect their
principles. :
‘Pariprasnena'—A_ striver, should ask questions of his
preceptor, with inquisitiveness, simplicity and humility, in order
to know the reality about God, rather than to display his own
learning or to put his preceptor on test. He should put such
* First of all having performed his duty according to his caste and order of
life scrupulously, aman having purified his mind should renounce the performance
of actions. After that having possessed the traits such as quietism and self-control
etc., he should go to the God-realized preceptor in order to attain the knowledge
of Self-realization.
In order to gain that knowledge the inquisitive striver, having taken the
fuel used in a sacrifice, with profound humility, should go to the God-realized
preceptor who is well-versed in the scriptures.
"
598,"Verse 34] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 557 _
questions, ""Who am I?"" What is the world? What is the cause
of bondage? What is salvation? How can I realize God? What .
are the obstacles to my spiritual practice? How to do away, with
these obstacles? Why am I unable to understand this topic of
God-realization?"" Thus, he should satisfy his curiosity and gain -
knowledge from his preceptor.

'Jnaninastattvadarsinah'—The expression ""Tattvadarsinah’,
stands for the seers of truth, who have realized God, while the |
term, 'Jnaninah' stands for the wise, who are well-versed in the
Vedas and the scriptures. A striver, should go to such a wise | |
seer, and acquire knowledge from him. |

In regard to, the purification of mind, there are three kinds of
strivers, who are qualified to gain that knowledge—the superior,
the mediocre and the inferior. The superior ones, are those who 7
attain knowledge of the self, merely by listening to Vedantic ~
texts.* The mediocre ones, attain this knowledge by hearing,
cognition, constant and deep meditation. The inferior ones, have
several doubts. In order to, clarify those doubts it is necessary, ;
to possess knowledge of the Vedas and the scriptures. Without
possessing knowledge, even such a preceptor who has realized ”
the truth, cannot clarify the doubts of his disciples. Similarly,
even a learned preceptor, who has not realized the truth, cannot
lead his disciple, to Self-realization. Therefore, a preceptor should |
be, one who is wise and who has _ realized, the truth.

‘Upadeksyanti te jianam'—By obeisance, by service and by
asking questions with profound humility, a striver will be able
to gain knowledge from the preceptor, as the latter is specially
inspired, to impart true knowledge in view of the disciple's ,
profound humility and perfect devotion. It does not mean, that
a high-souled man, expects these, but without humility and
devotion, the striver will not be able to gain that knowledge.

* The superior ones are those who have a burning desire to realize the Truth
at once.
"
599,"558 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4 ~
‘Here, the term ‘Jianam' stands for Truth-realization, or _
Self-realization. In fact a striver, does not gain knowledge ~-
about the self, but he gains it about the world. When a striver,
comes to know the truth about the unreal world, his affinity
for the world is renounced and he realizes the self, which is —
self-evident. |
The term 'Upadeksyanti' (instruct) means, that the great souls
instruct a striver, but it is not necessary that he should attain
self-realization. The reason is, that faith is a trait of the heart. A
man may prostrate, question and serve, hypocritically. Further, -
in the thirty-ninth verse, He declares, ""The man who has faith,
gains knowledge (wisdom)'. Therefore, here it 1s mentioned,
that the wise will instruct him, in that knowledge, while in the
thirty-ninth verse, it is mentioned that a man, who has faith, _
gains knowledge. Oo

glory of Self-realization. |

Comment:—
'Yajjiiatva na. punarmohamevam yasyasi pandava'—The
Lord, in the preceding verse, said, ‘The wise will instruct thee
in (that) knowledge.” But, merely by listening, a man does not |
"
600,"Verse 35] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 559 -
realize, the self. The Lord declares, ""Even after hearing, no one |
understands, the self"" (Gita 2/29) because, the self, is beyond -
the access of mind and speech etc. The self, can be realized by
the self, when a striver attaches importance, to discrimination.
When he attaches importance, to discrimination, ignorance totally -
perishes and discrimination changes, into self-realization. And
affinity is totally renounced, for the insentient. Then one never
gets deluded. ,
In the first chapter of the Gita, Arjuna gets deluded, when he
believes that it his kinsmen are killed in the battle, no one will : Bo.
remain alive to offer them water and rice offering. So, they would
go to hell. Moreover, it would be difficult for living women and
children, to earn their living, in order to maintain their bodies.
Having realized the self, a striver does not get deluded like this,
because his affinity for the world, is totally renounced. ~
""Yena bhitanyaSesena draksyasyatmani'— When he realizes
the self, he sees all beings (infinite universes), in the self. As a -
person, having awaken from sleep sees the entire creation of his
dream, in him, so does a striver, having realized the self, see all
beings, in the self. The same fact, has been pointed out by the
Lord, in the twenty-ninth verse of the sixth chapter, when He
declares, ""A Yogi sees all beings as assumed in the self.""
""Atho mayi'—A striver, having gained knowledge of the self,
by hearing, cognition constant and deep meditation etc., or from
the preceptor, sees all beings in the self—this is the realization
of 'Tvam' (self-realization). Then he sees all beings and the self
in God—this is realization of ""Tat' (God-realization). Thus, he
realizes the identity of the self with God, and, then nothing :
remains for him, except God. The trio, of the seer, the sight, and
the seen, gets extinct. When this trio gets lost, there remains, no
perceiver. Therefore, the expression, ‘he perceives’, refers to the
feeling prevailing in the inner sense of that perfect soul.
The sea and its waves, may seem different but both of these
"
601,"560 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4  ~
are, one and the same—both of these are nothing but water.
The sea and the. waves, are limited while the element, water, ~
is unlimited. Therefore, he who sees water in both the sea and
the waves, sees reality. As are the sea and its waves, so are the
world and the body. As waves appear and disappear in the sea,
so are bodies born and these perish, in the world. But, both: of
these have no independent existence of their own, only God
| has independent existence. In God, there is, neither world nor
body. These seem to exist because of the existence of God. Both
the body and the world because of their affinity for nature, are —
limited, while God is limitless. He who, instead of seeing the
world and bodies, perceives the Supreme Lord existing equally __.
in all beings, notices reality (Gita 13/27). oo
Appendix—Self-realization or destruction of ignorance takes
place only once and forever. It means that there is no repetition _
of Self-realization. The self once realized is realized forever.
The reason is that when ignorance has no independent existence, —_
then how will ignorance prevail? We are freed from ignorance
because we are ever free from it and the self is realized because
it is ever realized. : | |
The self is existence and knowledge itself. By disregarding
Knowledge itself we have accepted the unreal and by accepting
the unreal, indiscrimination overwhelms. It means that turning
away from knowledge itself we accept the existence of the unreal
and by accepting the existence of the unreal, discrimination 1s
neglected. In fact knowledge itself has not been disrespected, but
its disregard has been from time immemonial. If we assume that we
have disrespected knowledge, it shows that first we had knowledge.
Therefore if we respect it now, again it may be neglected. But
the knowledge is attained only once and forever.
After self-realization one is never deluded because in fact
delusion has no existence. Only the non-existent perishes and
only the ever existent is attained. :
"
602,"Verse 36] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 561 -
The universe is within the sphere of the embodied self and the .
embodied self is within the sphere of the Supreme Soul, therefore -
a striver sees the universe in himself ‘draksyasyatmani’ and then
he sees the self in God—‘atho mayi’. In ‘draksyasyatmani’ there
is Self-realization (Jiiana viz., knowledge) and in ‘atho mayi’ ~
there is God-realization (Vijnana). In Self-realization there is bliss
of the self while in God-realization there is supreme bliss. By
‘laukika nistha’ (Karmayoga and Jnanayoga) the self is realized
and by ‘alaukika nistha’ (Bhaktiyoga) God 1s realized.
“All is God”—Thus the knowledge of God in its entirety a
is God-realization. In Self-realization (salvation) there remains
an iota of subtle ego because of which there is difference of |
opinion among philosophers and in their philosophical thoughts.
If there is no iota of subtle ego, then how can there be difference
in philosophical opinions? But by God-realization even an iota ~
(trace) of subtle ego does not remain and all the philosophical
differences come to an end. It means that as long as there is -
‘atmani’, there are philosophical differences. But when ‘Vasudevah
sarvam’ (all is God) is realized, all differences come to an end,
‘atho mayi’ expresses this God-realization. In such realization .
no existence apart from God is intuited. |

Comment:— |
'Api cedasi papebhyah sarvebhyah papakrttamah'—There
"
603,"562 _ SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4 ~
are, three categories of sinful persons—(1) The sinful. (2) The
more sinful. (3) The most sinful. The Lord uses the superlative ~
degree, to emphasize the fact, that even the most sinful of all
sinners can cross the ocean of sin, by the boat of knowledge,
of the self. | -

The Lord assures strivers that, not only the strivers who are
engaged in spiritual practice, having renounced sins, even those,
who have committed innumerable sins, need not lose heart, as |
far as attainment of salvation (God-realization) is concerned.
Even the most sinful person, can attain salvation in this life, - ~~~
even immediately if he resolves, never to commit sin, but only
to attain salvation or self-realization. The sins, of such a person.
of firm resolve, perish in no time.

As darkness of hundreds of years disappears, as soon as a
lamp is lit, it does not take time, so do sins disappear, as soon
as knowledge of the self is gained.

The Lord uses the term 'Cet' (if) to clarify the point, that -
generally sinners are not engaged in spiritual practice, but it does
not mean that they cannot be engaged in it. If by coming into
contact, with a great soul or by being influenced by an incident
or circumstance or environment etc., they resolve, that they have
to gain knowledge of the self, or God, they cross the ocean of __
sins, by the boat of knowledge, of the self. |

The Lord, in the thirtieth and the thirty-first verses of the

° ninth chapter, declares, ""Even if, a man of most vile conduct
worships Me with exclusive. devotion, he must be regarded as
righteous, for he has rightly resolved and he attains to eternal
peace very quickly.""

‘Sarvam jiianaplavenaiva vrjinam samtarisyasi'—All the sins,
are incurred when a man assumes his affinity for nature and its

~ evolute, the body and the world. When he gains knowledge of
_- all the self, his affinity for them is totally renounced, and he
gets rid of sins.
"
604,"Verse 36] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI _ 563
When he gains knowledge of the self, it means that he
acquired the boat of knowledge. Even the most sinful of all .
sinners crosses the ocean of sins, by the boat of knowledge of
the self. This boat, is such as can neither be broken nor can a
hole be made into it, nor be sunk. Through it, one can cross | -
the ocean of sins. .
This boat of knowledge of the self, can be gained through
knowledge-sacrifice (4/33). Discrimination, occupies an important
place, from the very beginning in the knowledge-sacrifice and
attains perfection in the knowledge of the self. When this CS
perfection is attained, sins perish totally.
Appendix—Here the Lord by the expression ‘papebhyah :
sarvebhyah papakrttamah’ has mentioned the extreme limit of a
sinner. Though the term ‘papebhyah’ being used in plural number
denotes all sinners, yet the Lord has used the term ‘sarvebhyah’ -
with it. The term ‘sarvebhyah’ also stands for ‘all’. Even by using
these two terms the Lord has used the term “papakrttamah’ in the -
superlative degree which stands for the most sinful of all sinners.
The term “papakrt’ is in the positive degree, then ‘papakrttara’ is .
in the comparative degree and ‘papakrttama’ is in the superlative
degree. It means that even the most sinful of all sinners can gain
knowledge (wisdom). The reason is that the number of sins may
be large but they are unreal, while knowledge (wisdom) is real.
How can the unreal face the real? Sin is impure while knowledge
is the purest among the pure (Gita 4/38). How can an impure
thing suppress the pure thing? Therefore sins have no power
to suppress knowledge. The main obstacle to the attainment of
wisdom is attachment to the perishable pleasure (Gita 3/37—41). |
It is because of attachment to pleasure that a man has no relish
for spirituality and without the taste for spirituality, it seems
very difficult to gain knowledge.

As blazing fires burn fuel to ashes, O Arjuna, so, does the fire _

Comment:— |
‘Yathaidhamsi samiddho'gnirbhasmasatkurute'rjuna'— Inthe

preceding verse, the Lord declared, ""You can cross the oceanof —

sins, by the boat of the knowledge of the self."" Now, the question

arises, what will happen to the ocean of sins which still exists. __

The Lord clarifies the point, by giving another illustration. He

declares, that the blazing fire reduces fuel to ashes, so does the

fire of knowledge, reduce all actions (sins) to ashes, ie., all -

sins perish. os
'Jiianagnih sarvakarmani bhasmasatkurute tatha'— As blazing __

fire reduces fuel to ashes, so does the fire of knowledge, reduce

the three kinds of actions (i.e.,)—prarabdha (in the form of fate),

saficita (accumulated actions) and Kriyamana (the present actions), _—

to ashes. It means, that when a man gains knowledge of the self,

his affinity for the actions or the world is totally renounced.

Consequently, the world loses its independent existence and _

there remains, only God.

In fact, all actions are performed by the modes of nature

(Gita 13/29). But a man is bound by these, when he thinks that

he is a doer. An actions, such as circulation of blood, growth

of the body, breathing and digestion etc., are performed by the

modes of nature, so are eating, drinking, walking, sitting, seeing

and speaking etc., undertaken. But when one holds, that he is the
doer of those actions, these bind him. A sense of doership, changes
activities into action, otherwise they are mere activities. —

By knowledge of the self, the stock of accumulated actions,
"
606,"Verse 38] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 565 _
is totally destroyed, because, all accumulated actions depend on ,
ignorance. All present actions are destroyed 1e., change into -
inaction, because one has no sense of doership as they do not
bear any fruit. As far as Prarabdha actions (Fate) are concerned,
these produce favourable and unfavourable circumstances, but -
a man of knowledge, is not in the least affected by them. He |
remains equanimous, without feeling sad or happy. Thus, when
he has no affinity for actions, in the least, all his actions are /
reduced to ashes 1.e., and are changed into inaction. ,
Link:—The Lord, in the first half of the next verse, reveals
the glory of knowledge, while in the second half, He glorifies
Karmayoga (the Discipline of Action).

Comment:—
'Na hi jiianena sadrsam pavitramiha vidyate'— Here the term,
‘Tha’ stands for the human world, because only human beings,
are qualified to gain purity. Such opportunities are not available,
in other species. All nghts, in other species are acquired through
a human body only.
The belief in the independent existence of the world,
and the desire to derive pleasure out of it, give birth to all sins
(Gita 3/37). By the knowledge of the self, when the world ceases
to have its independent existence, all sins are totally destroyed and
a man becomes completely pure. Therefore, in the world, there
"

_ is no other means as capable of sanctifying as knowledge...
| The means, such as performance of sacrifice, charity, penance, —

Yamuna and the Godavari, destroy sins of a man and purify him. |
But none of these is as purifying as is knowledge of the self,
because all of them are means, while knowledge, is the end.

Who is the purest (most sacred), is very pure. TO
""Yogasamsiddhah'—'Yogasarnsiddhah' (perfected in Yoga)
_ stands, for the great soul who has attained perfection, in
.  Karmayoga. Such a great soul, in the fourth verse of the sixth
chapter, has been called 'Yogarudha'’ (one who is enthroned or _
established in Yoga). This state is, the last stage of Karmayoga.
When a striver attains this state, he realizes the self and his
affinity for the world, is totally renounced. -
In Karmayoga (the Discipline of Action), all actions are
performed for the welfare of the world without any selfish motive
and without a sense of doership. By doing so, a striver's affinity
for the body and the world, which are evolutes of nature, is
totally renounced. It means, that in that case, the world has no
independent existence, only actions, are performed. This is known
as perfection in Yoga. |
When a man is attached to action, and its fruit, he does
not realize ""Yoga' 1.e., union with God. In fact, a man has no
affinity for actions and material objects, because he (the self)
is eternal, while these are transitory (perishable). What can the
eternal (Imperishable) self, gain from perishable actions? The
self can gain nothing by actions—this is called 'Karmavijiiana’
(science of action). Having realized this science of action, a
man has no desire to reap the fruit of actions, in the form of
pleasure etc., and then he realizes his natural and eternal, union
"
608,"Verse 38] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI __ 567 -
with God, which is called 'Yogavijfana' (Science of Yoga). This |
is called perfection in Yoga. -
'Tatsvayam kalenatmani vindati'—The knowledge of the self,
which reduces all actions to ashes, and like which, there is no
purifier in this world, is found in the self immediately, when a -
Karmayogi becomes, perfect in Yoga.
In the thirty-fourth verse, the Lord said, that a striver
should go to a wise preceptor, who would instruct him in
(that) knowledge. But by doing so, it is not necessary that
he would gain knowledge, of the self. But here, He declares Tn
that a Karmayogi having become perfected in Yoga, gains
this knowledge, assuredly. :
The term 'Kalena’, used in this verse, needs special attention.
The Lord, has used the third inflexion, which means that through _
the discipline of action, one certainly gains knowledge of the
self or realizes God.*
The term ‘Svayam’, shows that a Karmayogi gains the -
knowledge of the self, while performing his duty, without the
guidance of a preceptor, or the scriptures or any other means. .
The expression 'Atmani vindati' means, that a Karmayogi, in
order to gain knowledge of the self, need not go anywhere else. :
When he becomes perfected in Yoga, he finds this knowledge,
in the self.
As the Lord pervades everywhere, He also pervades the self.
But, a person does not realize this fact, because of his inclination
towards the world and disinclination for God.When he performs
his duty scrupulously, for the welfare of others without any
selfish motive, his affinity for the world is renounced 1.e., his
identity with the body, sense of meum and desire, for the world |
perish, and he finds this knowledge in the self easily. The Lord
* In the term ‘Kalena’ instead of the second inflexion Kalam, third inflexion has
been used which shows that the fruit will be surely reapedi.e., through Karmayoga
the striver will certainly find this knowledge in the self.
"
609,"568 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA  [Chapter4
declares, ""He who is free from dualities (the pairs of opposites),
is released, easily from bondage"" (Gita 5/3). -
_.. This knowledge of the self, cannot be gained by the senses,
mind, intellect and other means (instruments). One will find the -
knowledge of the self, in himself. The reason is, that the sentient
self can't be known by the insentient senses, mind and intellect
~ etc. The means such as, listening to Vedantic texts, cognition and
constant and deep meditations etc., may help, in removing the _
obstacles such as notion of impossibility of gaining knowledge
and contrary sentiments etc., but they cannot induce a man, to ~
- gain the knowledge of self. He can gain that knowledge, by
renouncing his affinity for the insentient. As the world can be
seen with an eye but an eye cannot be seen by itself, but it can
be said, that the organ with which any object is seen, is the eye. _
So it can be said, that He who is the Knower of all persons and
objects etc., and by Whom all objects etc., are known, is the self
or God, Who is not known by any means (Brhadaranyaka. 2/4/4),  -
Having studied, the verses from the thirty-third to the thirty-
seventh, it seems that the Lord has glorified the Discipline of
Knowledge (Jiianayoga). But if we give a serious thought to this,
we come to know, that the Lord says, that knowledge of the |
self, which is so glorious and pure and for gaining which He is
advising to go to preceptors, who are well-versed in the scriptures,
and can be easily and certainly, gained through the Discipline of
Action (Karmayoga). The Lord declares, “He who is perfected in
Yoga, finds this knowledge of the self automatically, in himself""
(Gita 4/38). Thus, He has actually glorified, the Discipline of
Action. He means to say, that the knowledge of the self, which we
_ can gain from wise preceptors through obeisance, questioning and
service and by carrying out their directions, practising cognition,
and constant and deep meditation, can be gained also by performing
one's duty of fighting. It 1s not certain, whether he will gain, the
"
610,"Verse 39] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 569 7
knowledge of the Self from the preceptors, because they may |
themselves not have, realized the Truth. Besides, he may not have
reverence for them. In this process, first he will see all beings in
his self, and then in the Lord (Gita 4/35). Thus, in this process
of gaining knowledge, there is possibility of doubt and delay. -
Therefore, the Lord exhorts Arjuna, to follow the Discipline of :
Action (performance of duty) by which he will gain knowledge
of the Self, certainly and immediately. So, He does not want
to preach him the common method (of eight, inward spiritual a
means), to gain knowledge. | _
Lord Krsna Himself, is the Lord of all the great souls. So,
how can He order Arjuna to go to the wise, who have realized
the Truth and learn knowledge from them? Further, in the forty-
first verse of this chapter, the Lord eulogizes the Discipline of
Action (Karmayoga), and clearly orders Arjuna, in the forty- -
second verse, to fight by being, fixed in equanimity.
Appendix—‘Pavitramiha’—affinity for the world causes -
impurity; on Self-realization, when the universe totally ceases
to be, then there is no question of the persistence of impurity.
Therefore in the knowledge (of the self) there is neither impurity
nor inertness nor modifications.
The term ‘iha’ stands for ‘this world’. It means that Self- |
realization is worldly while God-realization is unworldly.

"
611,"570 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4 _

knowledge he achieves the Supreme peace in no time. 39 -
Comment:— , :

'Tatparah samyatendriyah'—In this verse, it is mentioned —
that a man who is full of faith, gains knowledge. A man lacking ©
faith, may think that he has faith. So the Lord, has used two
adjectives 'sarnyatendriyah' (who has subdued the senses) and —
‘tatparah’ (devoted), as the criteria of faith. The striver, who |
has subdued his senses, can be called, devoted to knowledge.
If senses have not been subdued, and these hanker after sensual = =
pleasures, it means, that the ‘striver is not, fully devoted, to the

_ knowledge of the Self. |

‘Sraddhavallabhate jiianam'—The esteemed belief in God, .
saints, righteousness and scriptures, is called 'Sraddha' (faith). _

So long as, a striver does not realize God, he should have
as much faith in Him, as he has when he has seen something

| himself. God pervades everywhere, but He is not realized, —
because he believes that He is far away from him. When he
thinks that He is in him, and his only aim is to realize Him, he -
gains knowledge of the Self or God.

The world being ever-changing has no existence of its own,

_ but it seems to exist because of the existence of God. Whena ~—
_ Striver has this faith, he gains knowledge of the self immediately.
It is only because of his lack of faith, that he does not gain this
knowledge immediately.

So long as, senses are not subdued and a striver is not
keen in his efforts, his faith may be regarded, as imperfect. If
the senses are attracted towards their objects, there cannot be
any concentration of effort. That results, in the dominance of

something other than practice. Unless, there is exclusive devotion
to practice, faith cannot mature. Because of immature faith, only
realization of the truth (Self), 1s delayed, otherwise there is not
at all, any cause for delay, in realizing, the Self that 1s ever
"
612,"Verse 39] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 571 -
available and ever present.

A person through obeisance questioning and service, should |
gain knowledge from wise preceptors, as mentioned in the thirty-
fourth verse. But, it is not certain, that he will acquire it because, | _
he can prostrate, question and serve the preceptor, hypocritically, |
not from the heart. But, here in this verse, it is mentioned that
he gains knowledge, certainly because he has faith, which is a /
trait of the heart (Gita 17/3). |

When a striver, has faith that he must gain knowledge of the
self immediately, this is called 'Sraddha’. God is ever-existent and SO
‘I am also existent and I want to realize God.’ Why then delay?

Fully developed faith, immediately leads to God-realization. |

How surprising it is, that the changeful world attracts us,
while the eternal Lord, does not attract us! The reason is, that
we regard the transitory world, as permanent, and want to derive 7
permanent joy out of it, which is impossible.

In fact, all the worldly objects, including the body, senses, ,
mind etc., are perishing (decaying), while the Self is eternal. Had |
the self not been eternal, who might have seen the changes? If a :
man (the self) had identity with the body, he (the self) would have -
also died, with the death of a body. But it is not so. Thus, it is by |
error that he identifies the self with the body otherwise, the self
is eternal, while the world, body, senses, mind etc., are transitory. .

Secondly, in this verse, the term ‘labhate', has been used. It
means, the attainment of something, which is eternal or whichever
exists. A thing, which has no pre-existence or which is created
and compounded, its acquisition cannot be called ‘labhate’. The
reason is, that the thing which did not exist in the past, and
will not exist in future, only appears in the interim, is not but
acquired. To regard acquisition of such a thing appearing in the
interim, is a disrespect to discrimination. The self existed before
"
613,"572 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4
the world was created, and It will exist after the destruction of
the world. Actually, the world does not exist, it seems to exist. —
The unreal has no existence and the real never ceases to be. As
soon as, we realize this fact, it means that we have faith which _
will inspire us, to gain knowledge of the self. |

'Jiianam labdhva param s4antimacirenadhigacchati'—The Lord,
in the third verse of the ninth chapter, declared, in the negative, |
""Those have no faith in this Dharma (knowledge of the Self), .
return to the world of death, without attaining Me."" The same
fact, has been mentioned here, in a positive form, when the
Lord declares, ""He who has faith, attains to the supreme peace""
i.e., is liberated, from the cycle of birth and death. Why does a ~

: man not attain, the supreme peace? The answer is, that a man
seeks the supreme peace in the perishable world—persons and _
objects etc., by having a disinclination, for God. The supreme
peace, abides in all beings naturally, but because a person seeks
it in the perishable world, he cannot attain it. When he gains -
knowledge of the self, his affinity for the world, which is an
abode of sorrow, is totally renounced and he attains the supreme _
peace, which is axiomatic (natural).

Appendix—‘Sraddhavallabhate jiianam’—esteemed belief,
faith and discrimination are necessary for all the strivers. Yes, in _
Karmayoga and Jnanayoga there is predomimance of discrimination
and in Bhaktiyoga there-is predominance of belief-faith. At first
the Self-realization is attainable—this faith a striver must have,
then only he will strive for it.

Link:—In the next verse, the Lord speaks ill of the person,
who lacks discrimination, who has no faith and who is of a
doubtful disposition. :

One who is devoid of discriminative insight, and has no

anywhere. 40

Comment:—

'Ajitascasraddadhanasca samSayatma vinasyati'—The
man, whose discrimination is not aroused, or the man whose
discrimination is aroused but he does not attach importance to TO ee
it, and who lacks faith, such a man of doubting nature, perishes
i.e., is deprived of the spiritual path. Such a person of doubting
nature, uses neither his own discrimination, nor listens to the |
teachings of others. So, how could his doubts be removed and -
how can he progress spiritually?

It is natural, for a striver who follows the spiritual path to be
confronted with doubts, because his knowledge is imperfect, this -
is known as ignorance.* Therefore, the appearance of doubt is
natural, and it is not very harmful. But it proves harmful, when .
a person does not make effort to remove it, and he rather wants,
to maintain it. In such cases, the doubt becomes a principle for
the person, and he holds that spiritual practice, is nothing but .
hypocrisy. So, he ceases to believe in God and the scriptures etc.,
and becomes an atheist. Consequently, it leads to his downfall.
Therefore, a striver should try to remove his doubt. By doing
so, he will gain knowledge. It is characteristic of a striver to
investigate and discover.

*Ajfiana'’ (ignorance) does not mean total absence of knowledge but it
means imperfect knowledge. A man (the self) being a fragment of God can't lack |
knowledge (discrimination) totally. But he attaches importance to the unreal by
regarding as real. Moreover he has no disinclination for the unreal, even when he
regards it as unreal. This is ignorance. If he makes the right use of his knowledge
(discrimination), his ignorance will perish and discrimination will be revealed
because ignorance has no independent existence.
"
615,"574 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4
A striver, should go on proceeding further to attain his
aim.. He should not be satisfied with, what he has known. He -
should have a burning desire to remove his doubts, and acquire
knowledge. By adopting such an attitude, his doubts are removed .
by saints or scriptures or by other means. If there is, no one to |
remove his doubts, it is removed by God's grace.
| _ The soul, is a fragment of God (Gita 15/7). Therefore, when
It has a desire to attain God, and feels sad and uneasy without BO
attaining Him, He cannot tolerate his sadness, and He satisfies
his desire. Similarly, when a striver, gets uneasy or sad, in order :
to remove his doubts, the Lord Himself, removes his doubts
and frees him from sadness, he has not to pray to Him even. _
An intense feeling of a person to have his doubt removed does
reach God automatically. :
The Lord, is a disinterested friend of all beings (Gita 5/29). -
So, He ever remains prepared to do away with restlessness, sadness
and doubts of a man, somehow or the other. One commits an .
error, that having known a little he feels that, he has attained
perfect knowledge. This pride leads to his downfall.

-""Nayam loko'sti na paro na sukharh samSayatmanah'—lIn this
verse, there is description of such a man of suspicious nature, |
who is ignorant i.e., who lacks discrimination and who is faithless
i.e., does not follow the preaching of others. Such a man, of
sceptical nature, perishes. For him, there is neither this world,
nor the world beyond, nor any happiness.

In practical life, a man of doubting nature, behaves badly
towards others, because he suspects their integrity and actions etc.
He also cannot attain salvation, because it requires a determinate
intellect, or firm resolve and a man of doubting nature, cannot
resolve, whether he should chant the Lord's name, study the
scriptures, perform mundane actions or attain God-realization .
"
616,"Verse 41] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 575
and so on. Because of his doubting nature, he cannot attain ;
happiness or peace. Therefore, a striver through discrimination
and faith, must get rid of a doubt.

When a striver, comes across two contradictory statements, _
it leads to scepticism. Such scepticism can be removed, either
by discrimination or through a reverential study of scriptures,
or by following the advice of saints and holy men. Thus, if a
sceptic is lacking in knowledge, he should acquire knowledge
and wisdom. If he is wanting in faith, he should endeavour to
gain faith. It is, because without especially enhancing either of en
these two, his scepticism cannot be removed.

Appendix—If a man has knowledge, his doubt is destroyed—
‘Jnanasanchinnasamsayam’ (Gita 4/41) or if he has faith, then
also his doubt can be wiped out—‘éraddhavallabhate jfianam’
(Gita 4/40). If there is lack of both knowledge and faith, then -
doubt cannot be slashed. Therefore the sceptic who is devoid
of knowledge (discrimination) and has no faith (belief) viz., he ;
who neither knows himself nor follows the instructions of others
(the wise), has a downfall or is ruined.

DOL SEES AS OD

Link:— The Lord, having started the topic of the Discipline
of Knowledge in the thirty-third verse, discussed the method of |
attaining knowledge and revealed its glory. Then, He declared,
‘Knowledge which can be gained through prostration and service
etc., from the teacher, can be automatically gained by a man, who
has attained perfection in Karmayoga.’’ After that He described
the person who is eligible to attain this knowledge as also the
person, who is ineligible for it. Thus, he concluded the topic. ,

Now the question arises, what should a Karmayogi do,
in order to attain perfection in Yoga. The Lord, answers the
question, in the next verse.

| He, who has renounced all actions by Yoga, whose doubts have
been destroyed by knowledge and who takes shelter in 'yoga', him, ~
actions do not bind, O winner of wealth (Arjuna). 41
Comment:— |
'Yogasannyastakarmanam'—A\ll objects, such as body,senses, “
mind and the intellect etc., which seem ours, have been bestowed
upon us, so that we may render service to others, with them, Mo cee
rather, than to lay a claim on these. Therefore, if these are
utilized, in rendering service to others, by considering them as |
theirs, the flow of actions and objects is towards the world, and
we realize equanimity, which is axiomatic. Thus, such a Karmayogi, |
who through equanimity has renounced his affinity for actions,
is called 'Yogasannyastakarma’, (one who has renounced actions
by Yoga). | : | -
When a Karmayogi sees, inaction in action, and action in
inaction 1.e., ever remains detached, during performance or non-
performance of actions, he is really ""Yogasannyastakarma’.
' Jiidnasaiichinnasamsayam'—Generally, a man has doubts
how he will be able to renounce his affinity for actions, while ;
performing them, how he will attain salvation, if he does not
work for himself, and so on. But when he knows the reality
about actions, all his doubts are dispelled.* He comes to know
very well, that actions and their fruits are transitory, while the
self, ever remains uniform. Therefore, actions have their affinity
for the world, rather than for the self. In this way when actions
are performed with a selfish motive, a man is attached to these
_  L.e., develops affinity for them. But, when they are performed for
others, without any selfish motive, affinity for them is renounced.
_ *The reality about actions has been described from the sixteenth to the
thirty-second verses of this chapter. Out of them the eighteenth verse is an
important one. :
"
618,"Verse 42] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 577
It proves, that performance of action for. others, not for one's .
own self, leads to salvation. | |
'‘Atmavantam’'—A Karmayogi, aims at Self-realization. So,
he ever remains self-possessed. All his actions, including eating,
drinking, sleeping and sitting etc., are performed for others (the :
world), because actions have an affinity for the world, not for the self.
- ‘Na karmani nibadhnanti'—When, a Karmayogi does not ~
- perform any action for himself, his affinity for actions is |
renounced and he gets liberated, from the worldly bondage ee
forever (Gita 4/23). )
In fact, it is not actions which lead to bondage, but it is desire
for fruit, sense of mine, attachment and the sense of doership
for actions, which lead one to bondage.
Oo | CIOL DD -
Link:—In the preceding verse, the Lord declared, ""Doubts are
destroyed by knowledge, and affinity for actions, is renounced by -
equanimity."" Now in the next verse, He orders Arjuna to resort

O Bharata (Arjuna). 42 |
Comment:— |
'Tasmadajiianasambhitam hrtstham  $jnanasinatmanah
chittvainarh samsayam'—In the preceding verse, the Lord
declared, ""He who has renounced affinity for all actions by Yoga
(equanimity), whose doubts have been dispelled by knowledge, -
"
619,"578 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4 |
and who is self-possessed— actions do not bind him 1.e., he is -
liberated from the bondage of birth and death. Therefore, He by
using the term 'Tasmat' (therefore), inspires Arjuna to perform |
his duty. Arjuna had a doubt how the cruel deed of fighting, :
would lead him to salvation. Moreover, he was in a dilemma,
whether he should follow the Discipline of Action or that of
Knowledge. So the Lord advises him, to remove his doubt, so :
that he may perform his duty scrupulously. A doubting soul,
can, never perform his duty efficiently. oo nnn enn
The expression ‘ajnanasambhutam’' (born of ignorance), means
that all doubts are born out of ignorance i.e., when a man does :
not understand the true nature of actions and Yoga. Ignorance,
consists in regarding actions and objects, as one's own and for -
one's own self. So long as, there is ignorance, doubt resides in
the heart, because actions and objects are perishable, while the
self 1s imperishable. -
In the third chapter, emphasis has been laid on the performance
(discharge) of duty, while in the fourth chapter, there is an
emphasis on knowing the truth, about Karmayoga. The reason
is, that action can be performed scrupulously, only when reality
is known about it. Moreover, if the truth about actions is known, |
such actions, which bind a man, can liberate him from bondage
(Gita 4/16,32). Therefore, in this chapter, the Lord has laid special
emphasis on, knowing the truth about actions.
In the preceding verse, also the Lord pointed out this fact,
by the expression ‘JnanasanchinnasamSsayam' (whose doubts have
been destroyed by knowledge). All the doubts of a man, who
comes to know the skill of performance of actions, (duties) are
destroyed. This art of action, consists in doing nothing, for one's
own self. 7
""Yogamatisthottistha bharata'—Arjuna had sunk into the seat
of his chariot, casting away his bow and arrow (Gita 1/47).
He gave the Lord, .a flat denial by declaring that he would not
"
620,"Verse 42] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 579 :
fight (Gita 2/9). Here, the Lord directs Arjuna to stand up, for
a fight having resorted to Yoga. The same order was given to -
Arjuna, in the forty-eighth verse of the second chapter, when He
said, ""Perform action, being steadfast in Yoga."" The term 'Yoga’,
stands for equanimity (evenness of mind). The Lord declares, -
""Evenness of mind is called, Yoga"" (Gita 2/48).

Arjuna thought, that sin would accrue to him by fighting
(Gita 1/36, 45). Therefore, Lord Krsna orders him to fight by -
having evenness of mind; thus he would not incur sin (Gita
2/38). In this way, we see that performance of duty by being See ene
equanimous, is a means to be liberated from, the bondage of actions.

In the world, innumerable actions are performed, but we remain :
free from their bondage, because we have neither attachment
nor aversion for them. It is because of attachment or aversion,
that we are linked with actions. When we become free, from -
attachment and aversion i.e., get established in equanimity, we
are not connected with actions and thus become free, from the _
bondage of actions. |

The self, ever remains equanimous and uniform, while
actions and their fruits, always undergo changes. When actions
are performed for others and objects are regarded as others’ and
for them, affinity for actions and objects, is totally renounced |
and equanimity, which is axiomatic, is automatically realized.

Fifth Chapter
INTRODUCTION |

Lord Krsna, in the fourth chapter, from the thirty-third to ,
the thirty-seventh verse, praised the tradition of going to teachers,
who have realized the Truth, having renounced actions and
sense-objects and directed Arjuna to gain knowledge from them -
(Gita 4/34). In this process of Self-realization, it is indispensable
to meditate upon God in solitude by renouncing action. Arjuna -
did not want to fight, because he thought that he would incur OS
sin, by fighting. He wanted to attain salvation. So Arjuna
thought, that the Lord was asking him to gain knowledge, by
renouncing actions.

Then the Lord, in the thirty-eighth verse of the fourth chapter, -
declared, ""He who is perfect in Yoga, gains it (knowledge) in
the Self."" It means that a striver following the Discipline of a
action, need not go to the great persons, who have realized truth -
nor has he to practise any other spiritual discipline, in order to
gain knowledge. Thus Karmayoga (the Discipline of Action) as -
the means of Self-realization has been commended here.

Arjuna, in the thirty-third verse of the fourth chapter, heard
the glory of the customary method of gaining knowledge and |
in the thirty-fourth verse by the term 'viddhi', he held it as the
Lord's order for him to gain knowledge by that method. He heard
the praise of Karmayoga (the discipline of action), in the thirty-
eighth verse and the forty-first verse. In the forty-second verse,
He ordered him to perform his duty of fighting. Thus, having
heard the glory of Jianayoga' and 'Karmayoga’' both, and also
His order to gain knowledge and to perform one's duty, Aruna,
could not decide which one of the two disciplines, was better.
Therefore, in order to get his doubt cleared by Lord Krsna,
Arjuna puts a question.

Arjuna said: | 7

O Krsna thou praisest, the renunciation of actions externally Co ee
(Sankhyayoga) as well as their unselfish performance (Karmayoga),
tell me, for certain, which one of the two is decidedly conducive
to my good. 1
Comment:—

'Sannyasam karmanam krsna'—Arjuna, did not want to ~
fight, because he did not want to kill his kinsmen.. In order to
support his ‘stand, Arjuna put forward several arguments, as in -
the first chapter. He said, that fighting would incur sin (Gita |
1/45). According to him, it was better to live in the world even
by begging than to fight (2/5) and he bluntly said to Krsna, that :
he would not fight (2/9).

Generally, a listener interprets a preacher's word, according
to his own views. Having seen his kith and kin, Arjuna, out of |
delusion, thought it proper, to abandon his duty of fighting. So,
he interpreted the Lord's word, according to his view, that He was
praising the attainment of Self-realization, by renouncing actions.

""Punaryogam ca Samsasi'—The Lord, in the thirty-eighth verse
of the fourth chapter, declared, ""He who is perfected in Yoga,
finds this knowledge (wisdom) of the Self, certainly without the
aid of any other spiritual discipline.” Keeping this fact in mind,
Arjuna says to the Lord, that sometimes He praises the Discipline
of Knowledge (4/33), while at other time He commands the
Discipline of Action (4/41).
"
624,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 583 _

""Yacchreya etayorekari tanme brihi suniscitam'—This question,
was put by Arjuna, in the seventh verse of the second chapter -
also. In response, the Lord, having explained Karmayoga, ordered
Arjuna to perform action, being established in Yoga, (even- |
mindedness), in the forty-seventh and forty-eighth verses of the :
second chapter. Again, in the second verse of the third chapter,

Arjuna asked the Lord, ""Tell me decisively, the one way by.
which I may attain to the highest good, (bliss or salvation)."" In 7
response, the Lord, in the thirtieth verse of the third chapter,
ordered him to fight, being free from desire, feeling of mineness
and mental woe (grief) while, in the thirty-fifth verse He declared, OO
""Better is one's own duty, though devoid of merit than the duty
of another well discharged.""

In this chapter also, the Lord clearly declares, ""The unselfish
performance of action, is better than the renunciation of action"" ~
(5/2); ""a Karmayogi is easily set free, from bondage” (5/3);
“renunciation is difficult to attain, without Yoga (Karmayoga) but
a Karmayogi attains, quickly, the Absolute"" (5/6). Thus, the Lord 7
explains to Anjuna, that he should follow the Discipline of Action,
by which he can attain to the Absolute, very quickly and easily. ”

Arjuna was, especially interested in attaining salvation. So,
time and again, he asked Lord Krsna, the way to attain salvation
(2/7; 3/2; 5/1). A keen desire, plays an important role, in attaining
salvation. Even without dispassion, a striver having a keen desire
for salvation, can follow the Discipline of Action, in order to
attain his aim of salvation. Arjuna was not totally dispassionate,
but he had a keen desire to attain salvation, and so he was a
deserving candidate.

The thirty-second verse of the first chapter and the eighth verse
of the second chapter, reveal that, not to speak of the kingdom
on earth, Arjuna does not even desire to attain, an unrivaHed
sovereignty, over the gods. But it does not mean that Arjuna
had no desire to gain a kingdom and pleasures, because he said
"
625,"584 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [ChapterS
that he longed neither for victory nor kingdom nor pleasures,
by slaying his kinsmen. It means, that he was prepared to gain -
victory or kingdom, without slaying his kinsmen. Again, in the
sixth verse of the second chapter, he said, ""We don't know
whether we shall conquer them, or they will conquer us, and
we do not want to live by slaying them.” It means, that if it was
certain, that they would conquer the enemy and if they could |
get the kingdom without slaying them, they were prepared to -
gain it. Further, in the thirty-seventh verse of the second chapter,
the Lord said to Arjuna, that he would be benefited in either ee
case. If he was killed, he would go to heaven, and if he became
victorious, he would enjoy the earth. Had Arjuna, no desire, in
the least, to go to heaven and to enjoy the worldly pleasures,
the Lord, perhaps, would not utter such words. It means, that
Arjuna could not cultivate real dispassion, but he had a desire -
to attain salvation, which is also clear in this verse. .

| The Blessed Lord said: |

""Sannyasa' (discipline of knowledge) and 'Karmayoga' (discipline
of action) both lead to salvation. But of the two 'Karmayoga’ Is
superior to 'Sankhyayoga’'. 2 a
Comment:—

[According to the principle of the Lord every person can
"
626,"Verse 2] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 585
follow the Disciplines of Action and Knowledge, (Renunciation _.
of Actions) of whatever caste, order of life and sect etc., he may -
be because His precept is. not for the people of any particular
- caste, order of life or sect etc. In the first verse of this chapter |
.Arjyuna called the customary method of gaining knowledge
by approaching enlightened soul having renounced actions as
‘Karmasannyasa’ (Renunciation of Actions). But according to
the Lord's precept a person can gain knowledge by following 7
the Discipline of knowledge even without renouncing actions.
Therefore, the Lord, supporting the customary principle of Arjuna, oo
answers the question according to His own tenet.] |

'‘Sanny4sah'—Here, this term, ‘Sannyasah’ stands for 'Sankhyayoga’
(Discipline of Knowledge), rather than renunciation of actions.

While answering Arjuna’s question, the Lord discusses the path |
of ‘Sankhyayoga’, in order to gain knowledge. Through that 7
Sankhyayoga, every man, while performing his duty, according

to his caste, order of life and sect etc., in every circumstance, -
can gain knowledge, of the self 1.e., attain salvation.

In the 'Sankhya’ discipline, there is prominence given to
discrimination. This discipline cannot be successful, without keen a
dispassion and discrimination. While following this discipline,

a striver keeps his eye only on God, without accepting the
independent existence of the world. So, the Lord declares, ""The |
goal of the Unmanifested, is hard to reach by the embodied being""
(Gita 12/5). In the sixth verse of this chapter, also the Lord
declares, that Sannyasa is difficult to attain without Karmayoga,
and Karmayoga is an easy means, to get detached from the world.

""Karmayogasca'—Every human being, has been attached to |
the performance of actions, from time immemorial. In order
to, do away with this attachment, performance of action, is
indispensable (Gita 6/3). Karmayoga, is the art of performing
actions, in order to, get rid of this attachment. In Karmayoga,
(Discipline of Action), every action, whether trivial or otherwise,
"
627,"586 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5 -
is not to be taken note of; but it has to be performed, for the
welfare of others without any selfish motive, in order to get -
detached from it. So long as, actions are performed with a desire
for their reward, one remains attached to these. |
""NihSreyasakaravubhau'—In response to Arjuna's question, |
which he put in the first verse, the Lord says, that both Sankhyayoga
and Karmayoga, lead to salvation, because the same equanimity is
attained, through both of these. The same fact, has been clarified, -
in the fourth and the fifth verses of this chapter. It has also |
been pointed out by the Lord, in the twenty-fourth verse of the a
thirteenth chapier, when He declares, ""Some attain knowledge, of
the self by the path of knowledge, while others attain it by the
path of action."" Thus, both the paths of knowledge and action,
are independent paths, to attain God (Gita 3/3). .
'Tayostu karmasannyasat'—Sankhyayoga, is of two kinds—one -
has been described, in the thirty-fourth verse of the fourth chapter,
in which there is physical renunciation of actions, while the other 7
has been described, from the eleventh to the thirtieth verses of
the second chapter, in which there is no renunciation of actions.
Here the expression 'Karmasannyasat’ stands, for the two kinds ;
of Sankhyayoga. : :
'Karmayogo visisyate'—The Lord, in the third verse, explains |
that a Karmayogi should be regarded as a perpetual Sannyasi,
(with the spirit of renunciation), because he is easily released
from worldly bondage. Again, in the sixth verse, He declares
that renunciation is difficult to attain, without Karmayoga and
a Karmayogi quickly attains to the Absolute. It means, that
in Sankhyayoga (Discipline of Knowledge), there is need of
Karmayoga, while in Karmayoga, there is none for Sankhyayoga.
Thus, out of the two, which lead to salvation, the path of action,
has been declared to be superior, by the Lord.
A Karmayogi, performs actions for the welfare of the world
and also to set an example to the masses (Gita 3/20), without any
"
628,"Verse 2] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 587 -
selfish motive. This sort of action is called a sacrifice in Gita. :
He, who performs actions for himself is bound (Gita 3/9, 13). _
But a Karmayogi, who works only for the welfare of the world
without any selfish motive, is liberated from the bondage of all
actions (Gita 4/23). Therefore, Karmayoga is better of the two. -

The path of action, can be followed by all the people, of all
castes, creeds and order of life etc., under all circumstances. But
the Karmasannyasa (renunciation), Arjuna talks about, can be -
followed, only under special circumstances (Gita 4/34), because |
all the people cannot come across such great men, who have oo
realized the truth. Moreover, they cannot have full faith, in those
great souls and have an opportunity to live, in their company.

Thus Karmayoga, is better of the two.

Karmayoga, consists in making proper use of available
circumstances, even savage deeds of fighting. No one is incapable, -
and dependent on following this path of action, because in it,

there is no desire to acquire anything. It is the desire, which -
makes a man incapable and dependent.

A sense of doership, and the desire to reap the fruit of actions, :
lead to bondage. A Sankhyayogi and a Karmayogi both, have to
renounce their affinity, for the world. A Sankhyayog!, roots out
a sense of doership through dispassion and discrimination, while |
a Karmayogi, discards it by performing actions, for the welfare
of others, without any desire for the fruit of actions. Thus, the
former is liberated by renouncing a sense of doership, while the
latter is liberated, by renouncing desire to reap the fruit of action. |
If a striver, renounces the sense of doership, his desire for the
fruit of action, is also renounced; and if he renounces the desire
for the fruit of action, his sense of doership is renounced. A man,
has a sense of doership, only when he has a desire, to acquire
something or the other. When actions are performed without
desire for fruit, these change, into inaction. Thus a Karmayogi
is like as instrument, has no sense of doership. |

629,"«588 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
A striver, tries to renounce his attachment to the worldly
beings, objects and circumstances etc., because it leads him to -
bondage. In order to renounce it, he does not consider any being
or object etc., as his own nor does he do and desire anything,
for himself. All his actions are performed for the welfare of 7
others, without any selfish motive. The desire for fruit of action
| causes a sense of doership and a sense of 'mine’. If he has no
desire for the fruit of action, his sense of doership, comes to an _
end. It is not actions, but attachment to them and the desire for :
fruit, which lead to bondage. When one does not derive pleasure Se
out of actions, nor does he desire fruit, how can a sense of
doership remain? When he has no desire for the fruit of action,
his sense of doership merges, in the aim (God) for which action
is performed and then only God remains.
The 'egoism' of a Karmayogi, perishes quickly and easily, -
because he works for others. So his egoism is, also absorbed
in rendering service to others. But the egoism of a Jnanayogl, -
(he who follows the path of knowledge) continues to exist, as
he holds that he is a 'Mumuksu' (seeker; of salvation). and he
works for his salvation. A Karmayogi, performs all activities -
for the good of others. Thus his ego subsides. On the other
hand, a Jnanayogi practises discipline, for his well-being. His
ego subsists, as he practises discipline, for himself. | |
A prominent feature of 'the Discipline of Knowledge’, is the
lack of independent existence of the world; while an important
feature of 'the Discipline of Action’, is lack of attachment. A striver,
following the Discipline of Knowledge, through discrimination,
wants to hold that there is no independent existence of the world
but due to his attachment to the worldly objects, it is very difficult
for him to hold this opinion, in his practical life. But a striver,
following the Discipline of Action, gets rid of his attachment
automatically, as his aim, is to render service to others, without
any selfish motive. Moreover, it is easy for a Karmayogi, to
"
630,"Verse 2] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 589 -
renounce objects, as these will be utilized by others; while it is |
difficult for a Jianayogi to renounce them, by regarding these, -
as transitory and illusive, unless his dispassion, is very keen.
Secondly, a Jiianayogi easily abandons objects of inferior quality,
but these of superior quality which he considers useful for him, -
cannot be easily, abandoned. But a Karmayogi, may offer objects
which are useful for him to others, easily, because he believes that
these will be used by others. If there is, an extra slice of bread -
in a plate, we try to put away the one which is stale, spoiled |
and dry; but if we want to give a slice to anyone, we will give ee
a good one, so that it may be used by him. So, the Discipline
of Knowledge, is very difficult to practise, without renouncing .
attachment. It 1s because of attachment that a Jnanayogi, being
entangled in worldly pleasures, may have a fall.

A man, cannot renounce attachment, merely by knowing the -
unreal, as unreal.* Though objects seen on a screen, in the cinema
are unreal, yet a cinema-goer gets attached to the cinema and -
wastes his time, money, eyesight and character. It is attachment,
rather than the object which bind a man. Thus, an object which
may be either real or unreal, or it may transcend the two, but -
it binds a man if he is attached to it. So a striver, should try to
root out this attachment.

Appendix—Though without ‘Yoga’ both ‘Karma’ and ‘Jnana’
lead to bondage yet performance of actions does not lead to
as much ruin as the bookish knowledge does. Mere bookish
knowledge can lead to hells— |

‘ajnasyardhaprabuddhasya sarvam brahmeti yo _ vadet
mahanirayajalesu sa tena viniyojitah
(Yogavasistha sthiti 39).

| * A man can renounce the unreal by regarding it as unreal by being established
in the self. This establishment in the self does not depend on instruments such as
the mind and intellect etc., because they themselves are unreal. How can we get
rid of the unreal while our affinity of the unreal subsists and we depend upon it
for realising the Real?
"
631,"590 §RIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapters -
“He, who preaches the gospel ‘all is Brahma’ to an ignorant |
man, condemns that man to the snare of fightful hells.” -
Therefore the man ‘who perform actions 1s superior to the man
- . possessing bookish knowledge. Then what can be said about the
- superiority of the person who follows the Discipline of Action! :
A Jnanayog! is useful only for himself but a Karmayogi is useful
for the entire universe. He, who 1s useful for the universe, is
also useful for himself—this is the rule. Therefore a Karmayogi ~~
is superior to a Jnanayog!. 7 |
The Discipline of Action can be practised without the - - ~~ |
Discipline of Knowledge but the Discipline of Knowledge is
_ difficult to attain without the Discipline of Action (Gita 5/6). ,
Therefore Karmayoga is superior to Sankhyayoga, Discipline of
Devotion is superior to Discipline of Action. Therefore in the |
Gita there is description first of Sankhyayoga, then of Karmayoga
and afterwards of Bhaktiyoga.* In this order the Yogas have
been discussed. ,
_ Karmayoga and Jnanayoga—both bear the same fruit (Gita
5/4-5). In their practices ‘Karmayoga’ and ‘Bhaktiyoga’ are ;
one—‘maitrah karuna eva ca’ (Gita 12/13); because Karmayoga
and Bhaktiyoga—in both, feeling of providing happiness to others
reigns. In the performance of actions ‘Karm1’ (One who perform |
actions) and ‘Karmayog?’ (who without attachment acts for the 7
welfare of others) are one (Gita 3/25) and in the performance
of actions, an enlightened soul and God are similar (one) (Gita
3/22—26). In this way a Karmayogi becomes one with a Karmt,
* The same order has been followed in the Bhagavata—

‘I have mentioned three yogas for the men who want to attain
salvation—Jianayoga, Karmayoga and Bhaktiyoga. Besides these three there
is no-other way for salvation.”’

a Jiianayogi, a Bhaktiyogi and God, all the four—this is the :
special characteristic of Karmayoga. ~

In ‘Sankhyayoga’ a subtle trace of ego may persist but in
‘Karmayoga’ because of the total detachment from actions and -
objects, no subtle trace of ego subsists. In Karmayoga, ‘Akarma’ 7
remains (Gita 4/18) while m Sankhyayoga the soul (self) remains
(Gita 6/29). |

Link:—Now, the Lord in the next verse, explains why Bo
Karmayoga is better of the two.

Wa: G Preaaearat at a Shy A areata |

Fidel fe veraret weet aerarpers 3

jneyah sa nityasannyasi yo na dvesti na kanksati
_ nirdvandvo hi mahabaho sukharh bandhatpramucyate

He who neither hates nor desires anything should be known -
as a Nitya Sannyasi (ever a renouncer); for, free from dualities
(pairs of opposites) he is liberated easily from bondage, O mighty- |
armed (Arjuna). 3
Comment:— 7

_ ‘Mahabaho'—The term 'Mahabaho', stands for one who is ,
mighty-armed i.e., brave, and also for one, whose brothers and
friends, are great men. Arjuna’s friend, was Lord Krsna, the
disinterested friend of all beings, and his brother was Yudhisthira,

the most righteous person, who had no enemy. By addressing
Arjuna as 'Mahabaho’, the Lord means to say, that he possesses
the might to follow the path of action easily.

'Yo na dvesti'—A Karmayogi, does not hate any being, object, |
circumstance or principle etc., but he renders selfless service to

everyone. If he has the least, hatred for anyone, he cannot follow,
the Discipline of Action, scrupulously. He should give priority,
in rendering service, to a person for whom he bears, even a little ;
"
633,"592 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [ChapterS  ~
malice. The Lord, by using the expression 'Na dvesti’, first of
all, wants to impress, that he who deems someone, as bad and -
wants to harm him, cannot grasp the secret of 'Karmayoga’. ~
For a Karmayogi, it is more significant to renounce evil,
rather than to do good, for the welfare of others. Actions and
objects are limited and, therefore, only limited service, can be .
rendered with such resources. But, when a man renounces evil,
his unlimited inward feeling, is prominent. Secondly, by doing ~- == ~~
good to others, a person cultivates notion of pride, which is the
root of all demoniac traits. Where there is imperfection, there
is pride. On the contrary, where there is perfection, pride is out
of the question. -
If a serious thought is given, it becomes clear that no good
can be done, without the help of perishable objects. In fact, those
perishable objects are not ours, but they are of those, whose -
service is rendered with them. Then, if a man is proud of doing
good, it is attachment to the perishable. So long as, a man is |
. attached to the perishable, he cannot attain Yoga. The pride of
doing good, is more disastrous, than other evils, because it settles,
in the sense of T'ness. Actions and their fruits disappear, but
pride settled in the sense of 'T'ness, never disappears. Secondly,
an evil as an evil, can be easily renounced. But when an evil
disguises itself as a virtue, it is difficult to renounce it. In the
same way, we can easily discard iron hand cuffs, but we find it
difficult to discard gold ones, because they look like ornaments.
When evil is renounced, by a man, good to the entire world, is
automatically done by him. A person, free from evil, does good
to the entire universe, even while, leading a secluded life, in a
Himalayan cave.
| 'Na kanksati'—Renunciation of desire, is very important, in
Karmayoga. A Karmayogi does not desire, any being or object
"
634,"Verse 3] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 593 -
or circumstance. Renunciation of desire, is very much connected )
with the welfare of others. By rendering service to others, we -
get the required strength to give up desire. |
In Karmayoga, it is a doer who is desireless, not action. -
Being inert, actions are not desireless or otherwise. All actions,
are dependent on the doer. A doer being desireless, his actions
are called desireless. Those actions, without expectation of fruit,
are called 'Karmayoga’. 'Karmayoga’ and 'Niskama-karma’—both .
are synonyms. ‘Karmayoga'’ is never 'Sakama’ (with a selfish
motive). The desireless doer, remains detached from the fruit Terns
of action. :
When actions are performed without any selfish motive, it |
is called Karmayoga. When actions are performed in this way,
the doer becomes detached, from the fruit of actions. But, when _
he performs actions by being attached to- fruit of actions, he
is bound (Gita 5/12). When all actions are performed for the
welfare of others, without any selfish motive, a striver is easily -
set free, from bondage. Therefore a doer should ever remain
desireless. The more, selfless he is, the more efficient, the practice .
of the discipline. On being totally desireless, the Karmayogi
reaches, consummation. :
'‘Jieyah sa nityasannydsi'—Arjuna thought it better to live
in the world even by begging, than to fight (Gita 2/5). So in
response to his statement, the Lord seems to clarify, that such
renunciation apprehending the death of teachers is external
(outwardly); but real renunciation consists, in being free from
attachment and aversion, while performing action.
Further, in the first verse of the sixth chapter also, the Lord
declares, ""He who does not light the sacred fire, is not a Sannyasi.""
It means, that a person who renounces all actions, such as sacrificial
fire etc., is not a Sannyasi. Sannyasa (renunciation), is an inward
attitude, by which a Karmayogi renounces his dependence, on
the world. Such a Karmayog! is a real Sannyasi (renouncer). 7
"
635,"594 | SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [ChapterS ~
_ Sannyasa (renunciation), consists in the performance of actions
without being attached to them, in anyway. A striver, who has ~
no affinity for actions, has never to reap its fruit (Gita 18/12).
Therefore, a Karmayogi, while performing actions sanctioned by
the scriptures, is ever a Sannyasi (renouncer). -

It is difficult to follow, the Discipline of Knowledge, without
following the Discipline of Action. Therefore, a striver who follows
the Discipline of Knowledge, is first a Karmayogi and then a —
Sannyasi (Sankhyayog1). But, for a Karmayog! it is not necessary
to follow the Discipline of Knowledge. So, a Karmayogi isa = ~~-—--—----
Sannyasi (renouncer), from the very beginning.

He, who has renounced attachment and aversion, need not go :
to the renounced order. When a striver resolves, that any person,
object, senses, mind and intellect, are neither his nor for him; |
and he has neither attachment nor aversion for them, he is, ever
a renouncer. A Karmayogi, while performing either mundane or
spiritual actions, ever remains detached. This detachment is real  -
renunciation. Therefore, he should be known, as one who has
ever the spirit of renunciation. 3 -

""Nirdvandvo_ hi.....sukham bandhatpramucyate’*—At the
beginning of the spiritual discipline, a striver has opposite
experiences in the form of attachment and aversion. He, through |
good company, study of scriptures and discrimination, decides
on God-realization as his aim, but his so-called mind and senses,
etc., are naturally, inclined towards pleasure and prosperity. Thus,
sometimes he wants to attain God, while at other times, he hankers
after worldly pleasures and prosperity. His inclination changes

* There is description of this sort of release from bondage in the Gita in the
following expressions:—'Shall cast off bondage of action’ (2/39); ‘protects one
from great fear’ (2/40); ‘one casts off in this life both good and evil deeds’ (2/50);

‘shall be liberated from the evil’ (4/16, 9/1); ‘shall cross all sins (4/36); ""having
attained Me these great souls don't take birth here which ts the place of pain and
which is non-eternal’ (9/28); and T straightway deliver from the ocean of death-
bound existence’ (12/7) and so on. ;
"
636,"Verse 3] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 595 -
according to the company he keeps. But he cannot enjoy, the
worldly pleasures undisturbed, because the latent impressions of -
good company etc., cause dispassion (disinclination for pleasures)
in his mind. Thus, there is a duel between pleasure and spiritual
practice. Egoism, hinges on this duel. When a striver, has a -
determinate intellect, only to realize God, rather than to hanker
after worldly pleasures and prosperity, this duel comes to an end
and his egoism, merges in God. | -
There is a struggle between, the pairs of opposites, so long
as a man, derives pleasures out of the persons and objects etc. oe
This inclination for pleasure does not let the determination for
God-realization, become firm. So there is a struggle. When a
striver has a determinate intellect, that he has to work for the
welfare of others without hankering after worldly pleasures, he
becomes free from the pairs of opposites. -
By the expression 'Na dvesti na kanksati’, the Lord, advises
strivers, that they should be free from antithetical feelings. Hate 7
(aversion) and desire (attachment), are stumbling blocks to God-
realization. A man, has to reap the fruit of his past actions, in
the form of desirable and undesirable circumstances, whether -
he desires them or not. But, it is an error, that he is attached
to desirable circumstances and has aversion for the undesirable
ones. As soon as, this error is rectified through discrimination,
he becomes free, from attachment and aversion.
Secondly, the self always exists independently, without
the help of objects, persons and actions etc. A man, (the self)
(the soul), has its existence, during sound sleep, also when he
is oblivious of the entire world. In the wakeful and dreamy
states, he can exist, even without any being and object. So, why
should he have attachment or aversion for them? By thinking
so, attachment and aversion, come to an end.
Attachment and aversion, are perishable, but a person being
attached to persons and objects etc., wants to maintain these. As |
"
637,"596 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter5S.  -
far as desire for God-realization is concerned, it ever remains .
uniform, because the self is a fragment of God. But the desire ~
seems to increase and decrease, because of his less and more
attachment for the world, respectively. His desire to live, to
know and to be happy, is in fact, the desire to attain the Truth, = -
Knowledge and Bliss 1.e., God. This desire, constantly prevails
in a human being. When attachment to the world, is renounced
_and there is only one desire for God-realization, he becomes =__
free, from the pair of opposites.

A striver, following anyone of the three paths—of action, = ss.
of knowledge or of devotion, must be free from the pairs of
opposites. So long as, there is delusion of the pairs of opposites,

a man is not liberated from bondage (Gita 7/27). Attachment

and aversion, are enemies which are the stumbling blocks to
God-realization (Gita 3/34). When a striver, becomes free from -
dualities, (pairs of opposites), attachment and aversion perish, —
and then he attains, God easily.

It is because of attachment and aversion, that a man gets
entangled in the worldly snare. All spiritual disciplines, are
practised in order to, wipe out attachment and aversion.* When -
attachment and aversion are wiped out, the ever-present Lord is
naturally attained without effort. The reason is, that He is not
realized through unreal, but is realized, by renouncing the unreal. |
The unreal world seems to exist, because of attachment and
aversion. It automatically goes, into extinction. So, if a striver is
neither attached to nor has an aversion, for the perishable world, he
will naturally attain salvation 1.e., will be released, from bondage.

Appendix—Equanimity in favourable and unfavourable
circumstances and freedom from the feeling of pleasure
and pain is to be ‘nirdvandva’ viz., free from dualities (pairs
of opposites).

* The only desired aim of all spiritual practices of Yogis is to get rid of
attachment to the entire world (Srimadbhagavata 3/32/27).
"
638,"Verse 4} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 597 -
In identification (of the self with the non-self), if there is
predominance of the sentient, there is eagerness (curiosity) and -
if there is predominance of the insentient, there is desire. A man
has the real hunger for the imperishable Divinity but he has the
relish for the perishable because he wants to satisfy the hunger ""
of the imperishable by the perishable. This duality between
hunger and relish strengthens a man’s worldly bondage. When ~
his attachment and aversion to the world are wiped out, then his -
thirst for Self-realization is fulfilled and his desire is wiped out |
and he becomes free from dualities (pairs of opposites). : oo
Link:—IJn the first half of the second verse of this chapter, 7
the Lord declared, ""Disciplines of Knowledge and Action—both
lead to salvation."" The Lord, explains the same point, in the -
next two verses.

Comment:—
'Sankhyayogau prthagbalah pravadanti na panditah'—Arjuna,
in the first verse of this chapter, called the method of gaining
knowledge from the wise who have realized the Truth, having
renounced actions, as Karmasannyasa. In the second verse, the
Lord, attaching importance to His principle, called it Sannyasa
and Karmasannyasa. Now, the Lord calls it ‘Sankhya’. By
Sankhya, He means establishment in the self by discriminating,
the self from the body. According to Him, ‘Sannyasa’ and
"
639,"598 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [ChapterS  -
‘Sankhya’', are synonyms, in which there is no need of renouncing ___.
actions physically. -

What Arjuna calls 'Karmasannyasa' is undoubtedly, a kind
of 'Sankhya’ mentioned by the Lord, because after receiving
instruction from a preceptor a striver, comes to know reality,

_ about the body and the soul.

The Lord, by the term 'Balah’, means to convey that those,
who say that Sankhya (Discipline of Knowledge) and Karmayoga ~~
(Discipline of Action), produce different results, are children viz.,
and ignorant, even though, they may be aged and intellectual. ee
But the wise, say that both of these produce the same result,
though they may be different, as means. The Lord Himself, 1n the

_ third verse of the third chapter, declared the twofold path—the
path of knowledge and that of action—different as means, but
_ the goal is one. | -

""Ekamapyasthitah samyagubhayorvindate phalam'—In the
Gita, time and again, it has been pointed out, that the result -
of the practice of Sankhyayoga, (Discipline of Knowledge) and
that of Karmayoga (Discipline of Action), is the same. In the ;
twenty-fourth verse of the thirteenth chapter, the Lord declares
that the self or God can be perceived, both through the path of

' knowledge and that of action. In the nineteenth verse of the third |
chapter, it has been mentioned, that a man reaches the Supreme,
through the Discipline of Action, while in the fourth verse of
the twelfth chapter and the thirty-fourth verse of the thirteenth
chapter, it has been mentioned, that strivers reach the Supreme
by following the Discipline of Knowledge. Thus according to
the Lord, both of the paths lead to the same destination.

Appendix—He who knows the scriptural topics but does not
know the reality about ‘Sankhyayoga’ and ‘Karmayoga’ deeply,
is indeed a child viz., is ignorant.

- In whole of the Gita the term ‘phala’ (fruit) for the
imperishable reality has been used only in this verse. The term
"
640,"Verse 5] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 599 -
‘phala’ means ‘result’. Karmayoga and Jianayoga—the Lord’s -
purpose in calling the reality attained by these two disciplines as
‘phala’ is that in these two disciplines, a man’s effort is important.
In Jnanayoga effort in the form of discrimination is important
and in Karmayoga effort in the form of action for the welfare -
of others, is important. A striver’s own effort (labour) proves
fruitful, so it has been called ‘phala’ (fruit). This fruit is not |
perishable. Karmayoga and Jnanayoga—both of them bear fruit -
in the form of Self-realization or attatnment of the Absolute.
‘Performance of duty’ is Karmayoga and ‘Inclination to do ences
nothing’ is Jnanayoga. The reality which is attained by doing
nothing, is attained by discharging one’s duty. ‘Performance’ (to
do) and ‘non-performance’ (not to do) are the means (spiritual
disciplines) and the reality which is attained by these means is
the end (goal). -

The supreme state, which is attained by the Sankhyayogi is also ~

Comment:— |
""Yatsankhyaih prapyate sthanam tadyogairapi gamyate'—In the
second half of the preceding verse, the Lord declared, ""He who
is well established in Sankhyayoga or Karmayoga (performance
of action), gets the fruit of both 1.e., attains God-realization."" The
same fact, is being pointed out by the Lord here, in this verse
by declaring, that the state which is attained by a Sankhyayogi,
is also attained by a Karmayogi. |
The Lord, uses the term ‘api’ (also), here to remove the ;
"
641,"600 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [ChapterS
: doubt of:those people, who think that God can be realized only —
by the Discipline of Knowledge, rather than by the Discipline
of Action. | a |
A striver, through both the disciplines, has to renounce his _
affinity for actions i.e., for active prakrti (nature). A Karmayogi,
in order to, distinguish the sentient from the insentient, has to
use the discrimination of a Jnanayogi, even during spiritual
practice. Similarly, a Jianayogi (Sankhyayogi), has-to adopt the
method of Karmayoga, of not performing action for himself. A
Sankhyayogi's discrimination, is to be utilized to distinguish the ~ =
_ soul, from the body (world); and the actions of a Karmayogi are
performed, in order to, render service to the world. When two _—
strivers—one following the path of Sankhyayoga and the other
of Karmayoga—attain perfection, both of them reach the same _
destination i.e., have liberation (Gita 3/3).

The world is uneven. The closest, worldly relationship is not
free from this unevenness, while the Lord 1s even and uniform. ~~
So, He can be realized by renouncing affinity, for the world.
There are two paths—-of knowledge and of action, available to -
renounce, this affinity. Jnanayoga (the Discipline of Knowledge),
consists in thinking that the real self lacks nothing, and so there
is no question of any desire or attachment in the real self. By -
thinking so, a striver gets detached. In Karmayoga, a striver
renders service to others, with those objects he is attached to and
to those persons he is attached to, without any selfish motive.
Thus in the Discipline of Knowledge, through discrimination,
while in the Discipline of Action through service, affinity for
the world is renounced. |

'Ekam sankhyar ca yogar ca yah pasyati sa pasyati'—In the
first half of the preceding verse, the Lord declared by negative
inference, ""The ignorant, not the wise, speak of the Sankhyayoga
and the Karmayoga, as different."" The same fact, is being pointed
out here, by positive inference when the Lord declares, ""He who
"
642,"Verse 5] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 601 -
sees that the ways (as result) of Sankhyayoga and Karmayoga, |
are one, he sees (truly)."" : -

Thus the gist, of the fourth and the fifth verses, is that the
Lord regards both the Disciplines of Knowledge and Action, -
as independent spiritual disciplines and the fruit of both is ,
God-realization. Those who do not know this reality, are called |
ignorant, while those who know this reality, are designated wise,
by the Lord. : co |

When a striver, attains perfection in anyone of the spiritual
disciplines, he has neither a desire to live, nor fear of death, nor :
a desire to acquire anything, or do anything.

A perishable body, need not be afraid of death, because it _
is decaying all the time, while the self, need not have a desire :
to live, because it is eternal. Then, who is afraid of death and
who has a desire to live? The answer is, that when the self -
identifies Itself with the body, it is afraid of death and it has :
a desire, to live. Both of these, (the desire to live and the fear 7
of death) can be wiped out, by the: Discipline of Knowledge
(discrimination).

The self, lacks nothing; therefore, it has no desire to acquire
anything, and so no desire to do any work. But when it identifies |
itself with a body, It feels the lack. Then, It has a desire to acquire,
something or the other; and in order to acquire that, It has to act.

The desire to acquire and to act, perishes through Karmayoga.

When either the Discipline of Knowledge or the Discipline
of Action, attains perfection, the desires to live, to acquire and
to act, and the fear of death, totally perish.

Appendix—Sankhyayoga and Karmayoga—both disciplines
being worldly are one and the same. In Sankhyayoga a striver
gets established in the self and being established in the self,
matter (non-self) is renounced. In Karmayoga a striver renounces -
"
643,"602 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [ChapterS
matter and having renounced matter (non-self), he gets established
in the self. In-this way the result of both—Sankhyayoga and
Karmayoga is attainment of divinity (pure-consciousness) viz.,
Self-realization. ;
To apply the body in the service of the world is Karmayoga
and to detach the self from the body is Jnanayoga. Either apply
the body in the service of the world or get the self detached
from the body—both will bear the same fruit viz., by both these _
disciplines, having renounced affinity for the world, one will get
established in the self. 7 ees
Here in the fourth and fifth verses the first half of the fourth
verse has connection with the second half of the fifth verse and
the first half of the fifth verse has connection with the second
half of the fourth verse. _
Karmayoga, Jnanayoga and Bhaktiyoga—out of these three
disciplines, Jnanayoga and Bhaktiyoga are more popular but
there is less popularity of Karmayoga. The Lord in the Gita ~
also declares, “This Karmayoga through long lapse of time is
lost to the world” (Gita 4/2). Therefore about Karmayoga, there
is a general belief that this is ‘not an independent means of God-
realization and so a striver following the Discipline of Action
afterwards either follows Jnanayoga or Bhaktiyoga as— .

A person should perform actions by the time till he develops
dispassion for pleasures (he becomes eligible for Jnanayoga) or
he develops faith in listening to My pastime and life story (he
becomes qualified for Bhaktiyoga).
But here the Lord declares that just like Jnanayoga, Karmayoga
is also an independent discipline for God-realization. Besides
these fourth and fifth verses in several other verses also the
Lord has mentioned that Karmayoga is an independent means’ _
"
644,"Verse 5] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 603
to attain Self-realization or the Supreme peace or salvation or
God-realization as—‘tatsvayarh yogasamsiddhah kalenatmani
vindati’ (4/38), “yogayukto munirbrahma nacirenadhigacchati’
(5/6), ‘yajiiayacaratah karma samagratn praviliyate’ (4/23),
‘jnanagnidagdhakarmanamh tamahuh panditarh budhah’ (4/19);
‘yuktah karmaphalam tyaktva Santimapnoti naisthikim’ (5/12).

In Srimadbhagavata also Karmayoga has been mentioned as.
an independent means for God-realization—

svadharmastho yajan yajiiairanasih kama uddhava |

na yati svarganarakau yadyanyanna samacaret _

(11/20/10)

‘He, who being situated in his own ‘dharma’ (duty) and
renouncing the desire for pleasure, worships God by the
performance of his duty and does not do any action with an | (en
interested motive, has not to go to heaven or hell viz., he is
freed from the bondage of actions. -

asminiloke vartamanah svadharmastho’naghah éucih

(11/20/11) ~

The Karmayogi being situated in his own dharma (duty) in ,
spite of discharging all his duties in this world, being free from
the fruit of sinful and virtuous actions, attains Self-realization
or Supreme devotion (Parabhakti). |

It means that Karmayoga (the Discipline of Action) makes a
striver qualified for Jaanayoga (the Discipline of Knowledge) or
Bhaktiyoga (the Discipline of Devotion) and also independently
leads him to salvation. In other words it can be said that Karmayoga
is a means for Jaanayoga or Bhaktiyoga and is also an end viz.,
it can lead to Self-realization or Supreme devotion.

Link:—In the second verse of this chapter, the Lord declared,
the Discipline of Action to be better, than the Discipline of
"
645,"608 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 5
stumbling blocks to spiritual progress (Gita 2/44). When we
- feel happy, after seeing a man happy, our desire for pleasure
perishes, because we have .become happy without enjoying
pleasure. Similarly, our desire for prosperity perishes, because
we spend money (prosperity) and material, naturally according to
our best capability to remove the suffering of a sad person, by
being sad with him, as we identify ourselves with him. In such
happiness or pity, there is an uncommon relish, which conduces
a man to renounce affinity, for actions and objects, and then he
(the self) realizes his identity with God. :
: ""Yogayuktah'—The Karmayogi, whose mind is pure, who
has controlled the body, who has subdued his senses and whose
self is the Self of all beings, is called ""Yogayuktah' (devoted to
the path of action). , a
A striver, is not naturally inclined towards spiritual discipline,
because his aim and his inclination, are different. So long as, there 7
is importance of the world in the mind, there is struggle between .
the aim and inclination. Generally, a striver's aim is to realize God,
Who is imperishable while his inclination is towards perishable, -
worldly beings, objects and circumstances. When his aim and
inclination, are identified, spiritual discipline 1s automatically :
practised, ‘speedily. Here the term 'Yogayuktah' (devoted to the
path of action), has been used for such a Karmayogi, whose aim
and inclination, have become one 1.e., God-realization.
In Karmayoga, there is no desire in the least, for fruit of
actions, but there is certainly an aim, to be achieved. The fruit
and the aim, are different. An aim is one, which can be ever
achieved by everyone. Thus, one's aim is God-realization and !
He can be realized, without any action and practice. The fruit is -
perishable, while God is eternal. A Karmayogi, does not desire the
perishable, because this desire is an obstacle to God-realization.
When a Karmayogi’s, only aim is God-realization, he is called
_ 'Yogayukta’ (devoted to the path of action).
"
646,"Verse 7] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 609 .
He, who has been called 'Yogayuktah' here, has been called

""Yogarudhah' (one who has attained to Yoga), in the fourth verse

of the sixth chapter. : -
'Kurvannapi na lipyate'—A Karmayogl, in spite of performing

actions is not bound by actions. A sense of mine, for actions,

desire for the fruit of actions, and for pleasure, and a sense |

of doership* bind a man, to actions. The gist is, that desire to

acquire something or the other, leads, a man to bondage. As a

Karmayogi, has no desire to acquire anything, he is not tainted

(bound) 1.e., his actions change into inaction.
A Sankhyayogi, is not bound by actions, because he thinks

that it is the modes which are acting on the modes (Gita 3/28); -

while a Karmayog! is not bound, as he performs actions, for the

welfare of others, without any selfish motive. —
The term ‘api’ (even), shows that a Karmayogi remains

untainted, not only during the performance of action but also -

during their non-performance (Gita 4/18). He has no interest,

in the performance or non-performance of actions (Gita 3/18). ,

He always remains, untainted. | -
It means that, a Sankhyayogi having renounced his affinity

for the insentient, identifies himself with the sentient, while a

Karmayogi identifies his so-called body, mind, senses, objects

and actions etc., with the world 1.e., instead of regarding them

as of his and for himself, he regards them as the world and

for the world. With this attitude of mind, he cannot have any

egoistic feeling, in providing comfort to others, doing good to

them and performing righteous acts, for them. Therefore, while

performing action, he has no sense of doership 1.e., is not tainted

by action. | |
* The Lord while describing Karmayoga, in the forty-seventh verse of the

second chapter by the expression 'Ma karmaphalaheturbhth’' means to say that a

striver should renounce the sense of mine, the desire for pleasure and the sense

of doership while by the expression 'Ma phalesu kadacana' He exhorts him to

renounce the desire for the fruit of action.
"
647,"610 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
Appendix—When a Karmayogi having renounced affinity for
the body, senses and mind (inner sense) realizes his identity with
all beings, then in spite of performing actions, the egoistic notion  —~
does not persist in him. Being free from egoism, the actions
performed by him don’t lead to bondage (Gita 18/17).

The Saakhyayogi, who knows the truth, believes, even though
seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, walking, sleeping,
breathing,: speaking, emitting, grasping, opening and closing the
eyes, that he does nothing; he holds that the senses move among
the sense-objects. 8-9
Comment:—
'Tattvavit yuktah'—Here, this expression, stands for the wise
striver following the Discipline of Knowledge, who has realized
the truth, that all actions are performed by prakrti (nature) and
he has no affinity for them, he is merely a witness, of the
activities of senses.
A 'Tattvavit' (knower of the truth), is he who thinks, that
he (the self) is not the doer; is different from the body, senses,
"
648,"Verse 8-9] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 611
mind, intellect and life-breath, which ‘perform the. activities. |
In fact, a man (the self) is a non-doer, but by an error he |
regards the self, as a doer (Gita 3/27). Actually all the cosmic, as -
well as individual actions are performed by Nature. But a man, |
by identifying himself with the body, regards its action as his |
action. So long as, he has in the least a sense of doership, he is
called a striver. But when he realizes, that the Self is not at all
the doer, he is called a great soul, who knows the truth. As a
person, having awakened from sleep, has nothing to do with a
dream, so has a great soul, having known the truth, no affinity
for actions performed by the body and the senses etc.
Such a great soul, knows the truth that the self is different
from the modes of nature by which actions, are performed. The
self, is the base and illuminator of all the objects and actions -
etc., It pervades everywhere, and does not undergo any change,
while objects and actions, undergo. The same fact, of distinction -
between the nature (Ksetra).and soul (Ksetrajna), has been pointed
out by the Lord, in the sixteenth verse of the second chapter,
in the fourth and the fifth verses of the seventh chapter and in 7
the second, the nineteenth, the twenty-third and the thirty-fourth
verses, Of the thirteenth chapter.
‘PaSyafisrnvansprSaii......unmisannimisannapi'—Here, the five
actions—-seeing, hearing, touching, smelling and eating, pertain
to five senses (eye, ear, skin, nose and tongue), while walking,
grasping, speaking and emitting, these four actions relate to
the five organs of actions*—feet, hands, tongue, genital organ
and anus. Sleeping, is an activity of the mind, breathing of
life-breath, opening and closing the eyes, of the sub-life-breath
named Kurma.
Thus, by mentioning the above thirteen actions, the Lord has
* Here the description of the five organs of action has been included in four
actions, i.e., within ‘emitting’ the actions of both the genital organ and the anus
have been included.
"
649,"612 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
described all possible actions performed by sense-organs, organs
of action, mind, life-breath and sub-life-breath. It means that all
actions are performed by the body, senses, mind, intellect and -
life-breath etc., the evolutes of nature, rather than by the self.
Secondly, it also denotes that a Sankhyayogi can. also perform
other acts, such as eating or drinking, business, preaching,
writing, reading, hearing and thinking etc., and also other acts
for maintaining the body according to caste, order of life, nature
and circumstances etc.

A man, considers himself a doer of those acts, which he
performs intentionally i.e., by applying his mind and intellect
etc., such as reading, writing, thinking, seeing and eating etc.
But there are several other activities, such as breathing, opening
and closing the eyes, which are performed unintentionally. Then, -
why has the Lord mentioned, in this verse, that a man should
not regard himself as a doer of these acts? The answer is, that -
breathing is a natural activity, yet in breath-restraint (pranayama) :
etc., breathing becomes an intentional activity. Similarly, eyes can
also be opened and shut intentionally. So the Lord, has mentioned -
that a man should not hold, that he 1s a doer. Secondly, the Lord
by mentioning, breathing, opening and closing the eyes, wants
to convey, that as a man during these activities thinks that he
does nothing, so should he consider himself a non-doer, while
other activities are performed.
‘All the above-mentioned activities, cannot be performed,
without a base and an illuminator. The Lord, mentions these __
activities, in order to draw the attention of the strivers, to the
self, which in spite of being the base, and illuminator of all
these activities, does nothing.

""Indriyanindriyarthesu vartanta iti dharayan'—The question
arises, how are actions performed, when there is no doership
in the self. The Lord, answers the question, by declaring that
actions are performed, when senses move among the sense-objects
"
650,"Verse 8-9] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 613
1.e., the self remains the non-doer (untainted).
The term ‘Indriyani'’ (senses) includes the sense-organs,
the organs of action, mind, life-breath and sub-life-breath etc. _
There are five objects of senses—sound, touch, sight, taste and
smell. The senses move among these objects. All the senses and -
objects of senses, are the evolutes of nature. So all the actions
are performed, by nature. The Lord declares:—
""All kinds of actions are done, by the modes of nature""
(Gita 3/27). :
""All actions are performed by nature, alone” (Gita 13/29).
The senses, and the sense-objects, being the evolutes of modes
of nature, are called modes. So it is said, ""It is the modes, which
are acting on the modes” (Gita 3/28). ""There is no agent, other
than the modes"" (Gita 14/19). It means, that when it is said that _
actions are performed by prakrti (nature), or by modes of nature
or by the senses—these three amount to one and the same. -
Nature, always undergoes modifications, while the self never ”
undergoes any, It ever remains free from a sense of doership.
Nature can never be inactive, while in the self, no action is -
possible. The self is the illuminator of actions, while actions
are subject to illumination.
‘Naiva kijicitkaromiti manyeta'—It means, that the self, was
neither a doer in the past, nor is at present, or will be in future.
Nature is ever active and all actions are performed by Nature, |
while the self, does nothing. But when the self identifies Itself
with the evolute of Nature, and regards the activities of nature
as Its activities, It becomes, a doer (Gita 3/27).
As a man, sitting in the compartment of a moving train, does
not move himself but he cannot remain without covering the
distance covered by the train, while he is seated in a compartment. |
Similarly, when a man, assumes his affinity for the physical
(gross), subtle or causal body, which are the evolutes of active
Nature, he becomes a doer of actions performed by these.
"
651,"614 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5

A Sankhyayogi, never assumes his affinity for the body,
senses and mind etc., so he never regards himself, as a doer (Gita
5/13). As actions, such as the growth of a boy from childhood __
to youth, changing of black hair into grey and white, digestion
of food and weakening or strengthening of a body automatically
take place, so does a Sankhyayogy think, that all other activities
are undertaken naturally and he is not their doer.

In the Gita, a person who regards himself as a doer of actions,
has been spoken of adversely. The Lord declares, ""He whose
mind is deluded by egoism, thinks that he is the doer"" (3/27).
""He who looks upon himself as the doer (agent), he of perverted
mind and untrained understanding, does not see (truly)"" (18/16).
But the Lord praises a person, who sees the self as actionless,
by declaring, ""He who sees that all actions are performed by = __
nature (prakrti) alone, and likewise that the self is not the doer,
he verily sees (13/29). - :

. The Lord, uses the term ‘eva’ (even), in order to convey that

a striver should never think, that he is a doer. By doing so, his
sense of doership comes to an end and his actions change into -
inaction. The same idea, has been conveyed by the Lord, in
the thirty-third verse of the third chapter, by the term 'Cestate’,
which means that his actions are nothing more than mere gestures,
of actions.

The second interpretation of the term ‘Eva’, is that even when
a man identifies himself with the body and considers himself the
doer, he cannot be the doer. It is merely an assumption, which
can never come true. The Lord, in the thirty-first verse of the
thirteenth chapter, declares, ""The imperishable supreme self,
though dwelling in the body, neither acts nor is tainted."" ""The |
soul, residing in Nature experiences pleasure and pain"" (Gita
13/21). In spite of experiencing the modes born of nature, the
man (self), ever remains the same. But he gets tainted, because
he does not see, the self.
"
652,"Verse 8-9] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI ~ 615
The Self, is sentient while the world, including the body,
is insentient. So the self experiences pleasure and pain. Why?
The reason is, that it identifies itself with the body (world) and ~
experiences pleasure and pain. But if It knows, its true nature
that It is imperishable, uniform and untainted, while nature in
the form of the world, the body and pleasures and _ pains, is
perishable, then it cannot be an experiencer, of pleasures and
pains etc.
The Lord, in the twenty-seventh verse of the third chapter,
declared, ""He whose mind is deluded by egoism, thinks that he.
is the doer."" Here, in this verse also, the same fact has been
pointed out by the Lord through a negative inference, when He -
‘declares, ""The Sankhyayogi who knows the truth realizes that he -
does nothing. Here the term, 'Manyeta' (think) does not mean, -
‘to assume’ but 'to realize’. The self, remains a non-doer during
the performance and non-performance of actions, equally. So, the
great soul who has known the truth, realizes that the self ever -
remains the same, as a non-doer, either during the performance or
non-performance of actions. The self, as the base and wluminator,
never undergoes the least modification.
The self, never lacks anything, but when It identifies Itself
with nature, It feels a deficiency in It, and so It desires objects, in
order to make up. In order to fulfil that desire, It becomes a doer.
No action, can be performed without nature, because the
instruments, such as the senses and the body etc., with which
actions are performed, belong to nature. So a doer, has to depend
on them. As a goldsmith howsoever an expert he may be, cannot
prepare ornaments, without instruments, such as an anvil and a
hammer etc. In the same way, a doer cannot perform action without
instruments. Thus qualifications, ability and instruments—all the
three belong to nature (prakrti), but these appear to be in the
"
653,"616 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
self, because of affinity for Nature. The instruments, undergo
modifications while the self ever remains the same. Therefore,
they have no affinity for the self. 7 -
A man (the self) thinks, that he is a doer by assuming his
affinity for Nature, otherwise there is no doership, in him. As
‘ a Brahmana ever remains convinced that he is a Brahmana, so
does a great soul, who knows the truth, believe that he is not
a doer. | |
Appendix—A discriminating Jiianayogi by performing actions
with senses of perception, organs of actions, mind (internal
instrument) and life-breath first assumes ‘I myself do nothing’
and afterwards he realizes it. In fact in the Divine Existence
neither an action is performed nor any activity happens. All
actions performed in the gross, subtle and causal bodies actually —~
take place in Prakrti, not in the self. Therefore the self has no
connection at all with any. action. :
Through ignorance a man by identifying ‘ego’ with the self,
is deluded—‘ahankara vimidhatma’ (Gita 3/27); the same man
by the use of discrimination by detaching the self from ego, __
becomes ‘tattvavit’ (an enlightened soul) viz., he has no sense
of doership. He ever remains established in the divine self.
The self, being deluded by egoism by an error, thinks itself
a doer and is thus bound by actions and their fruit and paves
the way to eighty-four lac forms of lives. Now if a man regards
himself as detached from egoism and does not consider himself
a doer viz., realizes the self as it is, there is no surprise about
his being an enlightened soul (liberated soul). It means that by
assuming the unreal as real, unreal appears to be real, then what
is the surprise, if by accepting the real as real, it is seen real?
In fact when a man assumes the self as a doer and an enjoyer,
at that time also he is neither a doer nor an enjoyer—‘Sarira-
stho’pi kaunteya na karoti na lipyate’ (Gita 13/31). The reason
is that the self is merely an Ever-Existent Reality. In that Reality
"
654,"Verse 8-9] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 617
there is no ego and ego has no existence. Therefore ‘I am a
doer’—however firm this assumption may be but it is certainly
an error. An error is wiped out as soon as it is realized that it —
is an error—this is the rule. A cave may have been dark for :
hundreds of years, but darkness disappears immediately as soon
as there is light, it doesn’t need years and months to disappear. .
Therefore a striver should firmly hold ‘I. am not a doer’. Then
this assumption will no longer remain an assumption but it will
be transformed into realization. |
“In ‘I’ this is identification of both sentient and insentient.”
‘T’ is used for matter (identified ego) and also for the sentient
(self). For example—‘I am a doer’—in it there is perception
of insentient and ‘I am not a doer’—in it (being negation of
matter) the self is perceived. He, who has an eye on matter viz., —
regards ego as the self, is deluded—ahamkara vimudhatma’ and 7
who has an eye on the sentient (the self free from ego) is an
enlightened soul. ;
When a striver at present ‘I myself do nothing’—thus
endeavours to realize the self as a non-doer, he faces a serious
problem. When he remembers virtuous actions done in the past, -
he gets pleased that he had done very good actions. When he |
remembers the forbidden actions done in the past, he becomes
sad that he had done such a sinful act and he had committed
such a blunder. Thus the impression of the past actions make him
happy and sad. In this connection there is a vital point which
needs attention. The self is never a doer—neither at present nor
in the past nor in the future. Therefore a striver should perceive
that as the self is a non-doer at present, so was it in the past. The
reason is that the present has become the past. The self is merely
an Ever Existent Entity in which no performance of action is
possible. Actions are performed only by an ignorant man whose
mind is deluded by egoism (Gita 3/27). A striver feels happy and
sad and is worried by remembering the past actions, that is also
really because of egoism. At present being deluded by egoism
"
655,"618 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 5

viz., by having affinity for egoism, a striver feels happy and sad.

If we perceive from the cursory (gross) point of view, as the

past has no existence now, so are the actions of the past clearly _ |
non-existent. If we perceive from the subtle point of view, we

perceive that as in the past, the present was non-existent, so was

the past also non-existent. Similarly as the past is non-existent

now, so is the present non-existent now. But the entity (the self)

ever exists. It means that the self is totally free from the limits

of past, present and future time. The self transcends the limits

of time. Therefore the self is never a doer. In that entity, which

transcends time and state (condition), imposition of doership and

enjoyership by connecting it with a particular time or situation,

is ignorance. Therefore the memory of the actions performed in

the past, is the memory of the person whose mind is deluded
by egoism rather than of an enlightened soul.

“Naiva kificitkaromi’ means that actions have no existence -
but the entity exists. Therefore a striver should ‘have aneye on ~
that entity. That entity being divine is ‘Knowledge personified’
and being immutable is “bliss personified’. This bliss is integral, _
quiet and immutable (uniform).

Because of the identification of the self with the body, in
every action a man thinks that he himself is the doer as ‘I see, I
hear etc.” An action takes place in the body but a man assumes it
in the self. In the self there is no action, the self is free from the
performance or non-performance of actions (Gita 3/18). Therefore
even when the actions are performed by the body, a man should
have an eye on the self and hold, “I do nothing at all.”

Link:—Having described, in the seventh verse, how a
Karmayogi remains untainted by actions, and in the eighth and
the ninth verses, how a Sankhyayogi remains untainted, the
Lord, in the next verse, describes how a Bhaktiyogi, remains
untainted by actions.

He who performs actions, dedicated to God and abandoning

moistened by water. 10
Comment:— :
'Brahmanyadhaya karmani'—A body, senses, mind, intellect
and the life-breath bestowed by God, belong to Him. Therefore,
how can a devotee, following the path of devotion, regard actions
which are performed by body and senses etc., as his? He holds,
that all actions are being performed by the Lord for Him; he is _
merely an instrument, in His hands. |
The Lord, wants to convey that it is He, Who performs all -
actions with His senses. A striver, realizing this fact, should -
think that He is the doer, of all actions.
' The worldly objects, such as the body etc., are not a person's -
own, these have been acquired, and these abandon him. So these
should be utilized, in rendering service to others, as offerings to
God. A person, cannot keep these as he wishes, neither can he
change these, nor carry these with him, when he leaves his body.
So, it is not honesty on his part, to regard these as his own. They
are the Lord's, and so these should be, accepted as His.
A Karmayogi, offers all actions and objects, to the world,
a Jnanayogi to nature, and a Bhaktiyogi, to God. God, is the
master of both nature and the world, and so it is better to offer
these to Him.
‘Sangam tyaktva karoti yah'—A man, is said to have abandoned
attachment, when he has not, the least, attachment or attraction
for beings, objects, senses, mind, intellect, life-breath and actions,
and has no sense of mine, or desire for them.
"
657,"620 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
Besides ignorance, which has been called the cause of life
and death, in the scriptures from the stand point of the spiritual
discipline attachment to the modes, is the chief cause of an — ,
embodied soul's birth, in good and evil bodies (Gita 13/21).
Ignorance, is based on attachment, therefore, when attachment
is renounced, ignorance also perishes. Desire springs, from
attachment (Gita 2/62), and is the root of all sins (Gita 3/37).
Thus here in this verse, it is mentioned, that attachment which
is the root of sins, should be abandoned otherwise a man will
go on committing sins. In its absence, he incurs no sin.
A man's, affinity for action, is not renounced, so long as, he
derives pleasure by performing it, and remains attached to its fruit,
it is rather enhanced. Attachment of a person does not consist in
merely desire for fruit of action, but also in being called good by = —
others. So, action should be performed, without the least desire
for pleasure, comfort or honour etc. If there is desire for getting —
pleasure, anyhow in the least, then that action is for one’s self. -
'Lipyate na sa papena padmapatramivambhasa'—A devotee,
following the Discipline of Devotion, while living in the world -
and performing actions, in order to offer these to God, is not
tainted, (bound) in the same way, as a lotus-leaf living in water
is not soiled by water.
Desire for the world, and having a disinclination for God,
is the root of all sins. Desire, springs from attachment. Where,
there is no attachment, there is no desire and so sins cannot be
committed, without attachment.
All undertakings are covered by defects (evils), as fire by
smoke (Gita 18/48). But, he who has renounced, hope, desire
and attachment, becomes free from all defects. When actions
are performed, in order to be offered to God, having abandoned
attachment, a striver becomes free, from the accumulation of all
sins (Gita 9/27-28). Therefore, a Bhaktiyogi, totally becomes,
free from sins.
"
658,"Verse 10] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 621

Here, the term ‘papena’ (sin), stands for the fruit of past
actions, in the form of virtue or vice, which cause the soul to
be born in good and evil bodies. A Bhaktiyogi, is never tainted Se
(bound) by that fruit, in the form of virtue and vice. The same
fact, has been pointed out by the Lord, in the twenty-eighth verse
of the ninth chapter, when He declares, ""Thus, shalt thou be freed,
from the bonds of actions, yielding good and evil fruits.”

Appendix—Here God endowed with attributes has been called
‘Brahma’ (the Absolute). It means that God is all—He is endowed
with attributes and is also attributeless; He is endowed with form ~ .
and is also formless. In His entirety all characteristics are included
(Gita 7/29-30). In Srimadbhagavata also Brahma (attributeless-
formless), Paramatma (with attributes and formless) and Bhagavan
(endowed with attributes and form)—all the three have been -
mentioned as one.* It means that within ‘Saguna’ (God endowed
with attributes) Brahma, Paramatma and Bhagavan—all the three -
are included, but within “Nirguna’ (attributeless) only Brahma -
is included because in ‘Nirguna’ there is negation of attributes.
Therefore ‘Nirguna’ is limited while ‘Saguna’ is entire. -

“Vaisnavas’ (the devotees of Lord Visnu) call the function
of the Lord endowed with attributes and form ‘Brahmotsava’
(function of the Absolute). Arjuna has also addressed Lord Krsna
as ‘Brahma’—‘param brahma param dhama pavitrarh paramain
bhavan’ (Gita 10/12). In the Gita Brahma has been mentioned
by three names—‘Om, ‘tat’ and ‘sat’ (17/23). Because of the
relationship between the name and the ‘nami’ (person having the
name) He is proved to be ‘saguna’ (endowed with attributes).

The Yogis, having discarded attachment, perform actions,

merely with the body, mind, intellect and senses, for the

purification of the self. 11

Comment:— :
""Yoginah'—Here the term 'Yoginah’, stands for Karmayogts.

The Yogis, who perform actions, offering these to God, are called

Bhaktiyogis, while those, who perform these in order to render

service to the world, without any selfish motive, are called,

'Karmayogis'. A Karmayogi, while performing actions, regards _

his so-called body, senses and mind etc., as the worlds’, and not

his own, as they have their identity, with the world. os
""Kayena manasa buddhya kevalairindriyairapi'—In fact, the -

body, senses, mind and intellect etc., which a common man

regards as his own, are not his, because these have been acquired -
from. the world and they will abandon him. So, it is an error

on his part to assume, that these are his. All of these have their

identity, with the world.

: If we give a serious thought to it, we come to realise that

the body etc., are not ours, in anyway. They belong either to

God or to nature (prakrti); or to the world. Thus, it is an error

to regard these as ours, and to have a sense of mineness with

them. The term 'Kevalaih’ (merely), has been used here to root

- out this sense of mineness with them.

Here, the term 'Kevalaih’, being plural, is an adjective, for |
senses. But, it does not mean that sense of mineness for mere
senses, is to be renounced, it means that sense of mineness for
the body, mind, intellect and the entire world, is to be abandoned,
for which a person, has attachment. When a girl, is married
"
660,"Verse 11] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI , 623
into a family, her relationship with her in-laws, is automatically
established. In the same way, when a man is attached to any
worldly object, he gets attached to the entire world. So the term ae
‘Kevalaih’, should be taken as abandonment of sense of mineness
for the body, senses, mind and intellect.

In fact, a doer (agent) himself, should become detached. By ,
doing so, his attachment for body, senses, mind and intellect etc.,
is totally abandoned. The reason is, that the body, senses and
mind etc., are, quite different from the self. A sense of mineness
with these is merely assumed, it is not natural.

In the Discipline of Action, renunciation of the desire for
fruit is important, (Gita 5/12). Common people, perform actions
in order to reap their fruit, but a_Karmayogi performs these to
root out attachment to the fruit. But a person, who regards the -
body, senses, mind,. intellect and life-breath etc., as his own, -
cannot renounce, the desire for fruit,* as he assumes, that when -
the body etc., are his, he should also reap the fruit of actions,
performed by him. Therefore, if a striver wants to wipe out the
desire for fruit, it is indispensable for him, that he should, not -
regard the body etc., as his own. :

When it rains, it is useful for crops and people etc., but,
rain is not aware of the fact, that it is falling and doing good,
to the world. Similarly, senses should not have a feeling of
doership, when they render service to others. But, if some service
is rendered by the senses, body, mind or intellect, and gives us
a sensation of elation, it means that the service has not been
performed with a feeling of detachment. On the contrary it is a
sign of attachment and possession.

‘Sangam tyaktvatmasuddhaye'—[Vide the explanation in the
tenth verse, for the expression 'Sangarh tyaktva.]

* If a person has no desire for the fruit but regards the body etc., as his own,
the fruit of action becomes his motive which has been forbidden by the Lord by
the declaration, “Let not the fruit of action be thy motive"" (Gita 2/47).
"
661,"624 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5

Generally, it is thought that a heart is purified when sins.
(accumulated sin), volatility of mind and ignorance, are removed.

But, in fact, purification of the heart, consists in total renunciation — |
of attachment, (or a sense of mine), with the body, senses, mind

and intellect. The body, etc., never regards us as theirs but, we

assume these, as ours. This assumption of mineness, is impurity.

Saint Tulasidasa in the Ramacaritamanasa declares, ""Let the filth

of the sense of mine, be burnt” (7/117 A). So, heart gets purified

when there is total renunciation of affinity, of an egoistic notion

and sense of mine etc.

The term 'Kevalaih’, denotes the aim of renunciation of the
sense of ‘mine’, with the body, senses, mind and intellect, while
the expression 'Atmasuddhaye’, denotes total renunciation of a
sense of ‘mine’. When a striver's aim, is to renounce the sense
of mine, yet this sense prevails, in its subtle form. When, this
sense of mine in its subtle form, also perishes totally, it is known -
as a state of purification of the inner sense. ;

The sense of mine, also resides in egoism. When this sense
of mine, is totally renounced, egoism also becomes free from -
this sense of mine, and the self (heart) is, totally purified.

""Karma kurvanti'—A Karmayog}, performs actions to totally
renounce, a sense of mine, in-its subtle form, from the body,
senses, mind and intellect etc. |

So long as, a person has a desire for the fruit of action,
and so long as, he assumes that the body, senses and mind
etc., are his own, he cannot be liberated from, the bondage of
actions. Therefore, a Karmayog! performs actions for the welfare

_of others, without having a desire for the fruit of actions, and
without regarding the objects of action (body, senses, mind and
intellect etc.,) as his own. For a sage, who wishes to attain to
Yoga, action (for the welfare of others), is said to be, the means
(Gita 6/3). The more, he continues working for the welfare of
others, the more his attachment and sense of mine, are renounced
"
662,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 625
and thus his self (heart) is purified. |
_ Appendix—The heart is not purified by trying to purify it _ |
because it is not purified so long as we regard it as ours, since
the assumption of mineness with it is the main impurity. Therefore
in the Ramacaritamanasa it. has been declared, ‘Let the filth of
mineness be burnt!’ (Manasa, Uttara. 117 A). The Lord here also
by using the term ‘kevalaih’ has mentioned not to have the sense
_ of mineness with the inner sense. Punfication of the inner sense
consists in total renunciation of the sense of mineness with the
body, senses, mind and intellect. Therefore Karmayogis act in
a detached manner in order to wipe out the sense of mineness
totally from the inner sense. They don’t perform any action for
their own Self. The reason is that so long as the sense of mine
persists, mere actions are performed, but Karmayoga is not -
practised. When actions are not performed for one’s own self, -
then Karmayoga proceeds towards Self-realization. -
A Karmayog! first acts aiming at freedom fron: the sense |
of mineness, then his aim is achieved. -

glory of Karmayoga by positive, as well as negative inference.

The Karmayogi attains everlasting peace (God-realization), by

Comment:-—
""Yuktah'—The meaning of this term, is taken according to the
"
663,"626 __ SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 5

context. In the eighth verse of this chapter, the term 'Yuktah' has

been used for the 'Sankhyayog1’, who does not regard himself, as

a doer of actions, while here it has been used for the Karmayogi, Te
who has renounced the fruit of action.

All strivers, whose aim:is to attain equanimity, are ""Yuktah' or
""Yog1. In the present verse, it has been used for a Karmayogi, who

_ having a determinate intellect, has renounced worldly desires.

'‘Karmaphalam tyaktva'—This expression, means the
renunciation of desire for fruit and also, renunciation of attachment,
because 1n fact it is not the fruit of acttons which is renounced,
it is desire forthe fruit of actions, which is renounced. That
fruit may be reaped, either immediately or in the future. When
a striver, regards nothing as his, does nothing for him, desires
nothing for him, it means that he has renounced, the desire for -
the fruit of actions. | ,

A man's prarabdha (fate), is determined by the hoard of his ;
past actions, and according to that he is born in good and evil
wombs. In human life, actions which are performed, produce
impressions that are added to the stock. But, when he renounces ~
attachment to the fruit of actions, such actions cannot bear fruit,
like roasted seed and these change, into inaction (Gita 4/20).
Because of the effect of actions, which are performed without
desire for the fruit of actions, the latent impressions of the old
actions, (accumulated of past actions), -are reduced to nothing
(Gita 4/23). Thus, the cause of his rebirth, melts away.

Fruit of actions, is of four kinds:—

(1) Visible—The fruit of present actions, which is visible
immediately, as satisfying one's hunger after having a meal, is
a visible fruit. :

(2) Unforeseen—Fruit, which will be reaped in future, in
the form of favourable or unfavourable circumstances etc., here
or hereafter. This fruit is unforeseen. At present the action goes
to the accumulated stock of actions.
"
664,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 627

(3) Received as fruit of past actions:—The body (with its caste,
order of life) wealth, property and favourable or unfavourable
‘circumstances, which have been bestowed upon us, as a result _ |
of past deeds. .

(4) Unréceived, fruits yet to be reaped in future:—Favourable
and unfavourable circumstances, which we have to receive in
future as ordained by destiny (prarabdha karma).

Out of the four kinds, of fruit of action, the visible and the ©
unforeseen, depend on present actions, while the received and
unreceived ones, depend on prarabdha karma. When a striver,
does not desire the visible fruit, nor does he feel displeased or
pleased, having received it; and does not expect the unforeseen
one; nor is he attached to the received, fruit nor feels happy or
sad having received it, and does not desire, the unreceived one, -
then, it is said that he has renounced, the fruit of action.

Common people, perform actions with a desire for the fruit 7
of actions, and during performance, they go on thinking of that :
desire. As a businessman makes transactions for profit and goes
on thinking about profit and feels happy with profit, and sad ~
with loss; similarly, all people perform actions, having desire for
favourable gains, such as wife, son, riches, honour and praise
etc. But, a Karmayogi performs actions, by renouncing desire,
for fruit. .

Now a question arises, why should a man perform actions,
if he has no desire? The answer is, that none can ever remain
still for even a moment, without performing action (Gita 3/5).

Even if, it is accepted that a man can abandon actions, to a
great degree, even then, so long as, he is attached to the world,
he will think of sense-objects and that is also, an action. The
thought, of sense-objects, finally leads him to ruin (Gita 2/62-63).
Therefore, so long as, a striver does not renounce attachment
totally, he cannot be liberated, from the bondage of action. The
old attachment, is wiped out by performance of action, while,
"
665,"628 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
the new one does not arise, when actions are performed for the
welfare of others, and without any selfish motive.

In fact, it is ignorance if actions are performed with desire
for fruit, because firstly actions and their fruits are perishable, oe |
and secondly, these will bear fruit, according to fate whether
desired or not. A man cannot have, increase or decrease in fruit,
by mere desire. |

When actions are performed for the welfare of others, without
desire for fruit, affinity for these, is renounced. A Karmayogi, does
not perform actions without an aim, like an insane man, but he
performs these having a high aim of God-realization. To realize

his aim, he works for the welfare of others. As he is not attached

to the body, he performs actions, promptly and scrupulously,
without such evils, as indolence and heedlessness.

If actions, which are performed, to acquire the worldly -
materials, are performed, for the welfare of the world, with the aim
of God-realization, and without any selfish motive, these actions _
can lead a man to God-realization. In the, twentieth verse of the
third chapter, it has been declared, ""Janaka and others attained
perfection, verily by action only,"" while in the third verse of the
sixth chapter, it has been stated, ""Action is said, to be the means |
with a sage, who wishes to attain to Yoga."" These facts, reveal
that God can be realized by actions. Parvati and Manu-Satarupa
etc., also realized God, through performance of actions, in the
form of penance. It is also mentioned in the scriptures, that He
can be realized through chanting, meditation, good company,
study of scriptures and cognition etc. On the contrary, it is also
mentioned, that He cannot be realized, through actions, such as
penance etc., (Gita 11/53). How to reconcile the two?

The answer is, that in fact God is not attained through any
action. He is also, not a fruit of action. God pervades everywhere,
"
666,"Verse: 12] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 629 |
everything, incident, circumstance and person etc., all the time.
He is ever-attainable to everyone, and everyone abides in Him,
only. No one can ever be separate, from Him. But, a man being oo .
attached to perishable body, senses, mind, intellect and objects
etc., which are evolutes of insentient nature, has a disinclination
for God, Who is his. Spiritual discipline, is to be practised, in
order to wipe out this attachment or affinity.
Through the performance of penance etc., when this affinity for
the insentient, is renounced, God, Who is ever-attainable, is attained.
This affinity can be very easily renounced, when actions are
performed for the welfare of the world, without any selfish motive.
The sentient and eternal Lord, cannot be bought, for all the
wealth of the world. All the worldly objects, stand nowhere, when
all of them are compared to the imperishable Lord. Moreover, a -
thing which is bought for a particular amount, is cheaper than
that amount. Thus if God is realized by performing actions, it -
means, that He is cheaper than actions. ~
Here is a vital point, which calls for attention. Generally,
strivers during spiritual practice depend on and have affinity for ~
the body, senses, mind, intellect etc., with which, they perform
that spiritual activity. So long as, they have affinity for these 1.e.,
the insentient, they cannot realize God. As soon as, this affinity 7
is renounced, God is realized. God-realization is not possible,
through matter, rather it is by snapping our connection with it.
The body, senses, mind and intellect etc., belong to the same
class, to which the world belongs. So these should be utilized,
in rendering service to the world (this is Karmayoga). A striver,
should not accept his affinity for these, nor should be depend on
them, as he cannot get rid of the unreal, by having affinity for
the unreal. Actions are performed, without any selfish motive,
in order to renounce affinity, for the unreal. When this affinity
is totally renounced, disinclination for God perishes, and ever-
attained God, is realized. :
"
667,"630 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 5

'Santim4pnoti naisthikim'—It has stood the test of experience,
that when a person has neither desire, for the worldly objects, nor
is attached to them, he attains peace. Even, during sound sleep
when the world is forgotten, a man experiences peace. Similarly, - |
one attains peace, when he completes any assignment or task,
such as the marriage of his daughter. If he renounces his affinity,
(desire and attachment) during wakefulness, he will attain peace.

But if he enjoys this peace, he cannot attain everlasting peace
or the supreme peace,* because this peace is not an end, but a
means to attain the supreme peace, called Yoga (Gita 6/3).

So long as, a striver remains attached to peace, which he
attains by renouncing his affinity for the world, he is bound
(Gita 14/6) and he cannot attain, the supreme, uniform and
eternal peace. _

-‘Ayuktah kamakarena phale sakto nibadhyate'—The term
‘Ayuktah', has been used for a person, who works with a selfish -
motive. Such a person, because of his several desires, being -
attached to fruit of actions, has to follow, the cycle of birth and
death. A person cannot acquire things etc., merely by having -
a desire. Secondly he cannot possess these forever, even if he

_ has acquired them. So, it is futile to have a desire for acquiring

objects etc., saint Tulasidasa in the Vinaya-Patrika declares, ""All

worldly objects will abandon you, in the end; it is better, if you
abandon, them right now"" (198).

It does not mean, that their physical abandonment
(renouncement) leads to salvation, or God-realization. Had it
been so, all persons who left their bodies, (at the time of death)
would have attained salvation. But, it is not so. In fact it is
desire, a sense of mine and attachment to these which are to be
renounced, because these lead to bondage i.e., end to the cycle

: *This everlasting (supreme) peace is God-realization. It has been
called ‘eternal peace’ (9/31), ‘the supreme peace’ (4/39; 18/62) and ‘peace’
(5/29, 2/70-71) in the Gita.
"
668,"Verse 13] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 631
of birth and death. When actions are performed, for the welfare
of others, their flow is towards others, and any assumed affinity
for them, is easily renounced. Se
Appendix—lIn fact practice of the spiritual discipline in order
to attain salvation or God-realization is also attachment to the
fruit of action. A man has formed the habit to do a piece of work
with the desire for its fruit; therefore it is said that one should
practise spiritual discipline for salvation or God-realization.
In fact spiritual practice is needed in order to wipe out
attachment to the world; otherwise salvation is axiomatic. The
Lord is ever attained. God-realization is not the fruit of an action. :
Therefore the yearning for the performance of action in order to
attain God 1s also the desire for fruit.
A striver should not think that this spiritual practice will a
bear this fruit. Desiring the fruit is an attachment to the fruit
which does not allow the spiritual discipline to be followed ;
scrupulously. Therefore instead of thinking of the fruit, a striver
should practise spiritual discipline promptly which will naturally
lead him to divine perfection. If a striver goes on thinking for -
the fruit, he will not attain divine perfection.
_ We shall attain the transcendental state or the desireless state
and then we shall be happy—in this way the desire to derive
happiness or pleasure is also the desire for fruit which hinders
a striver from becoming transcendental and desireless.

The embodied (soul) having controlled the senses, and having
renounced the performance of all actions by discrimination, in the
abode of nine gates, neither acting nor causing others to act, he
rests happily in the self. 13 |
Comment:— | |

""VaSi dehi'—When a man is attached, to the senses, mind and
intellect etc., these control him, but when he renounces attachment
to them, they remain under his control. A Sankhyayogi being
so, is called 'Vasr'. .

So long as, a man has the least attachment for the evolutes of
nature, (body, senses etc.,) he has to remain under the control of
nature (Gita 3/5). Prakrti (nature), ever remains active. Therefore,

a man cannot refrain himself, from performing actions, so long

as he is, attached to Nature. But a Sankhyayogi, who is not at _
all attached to the gross, subtle and causal bodies, the evolutes of —
Nature, do not become the performer of actions. Though sucha -
Sankhyayog!, has not the least attachment for the body, yet,heis =~
called the embodied one, as he seems so, to the common people.

""Navadvare pure'—Two ears, two eyes, two nostrils, a -

_ mouth—these seven, located: in the upper part of the body,
while the genital organ and the anus located in the lower part

| of the trunk, these nine openings, have been called, the nine
gates. This body has been called the city. of nine gates, in order
to clarify the point, that as the abode and those who inhabit the
abode, are different, so are a body and the soul. As a person,
living in the city does not regard activities undertaken in the
city, as his own, so does a Sankhyayogi not regard activities of
the body, as his own.

'Sarvakarmani manasa sannyasya'—Here, the expression
‘Sarvakarmant’, stands for the thirteen types of actions performed,
with the body, senses, mind, intellect and life-breath, as described

| in the eighth and ninth verses, of this chapter.
Here the expression 'Manasa sannyasya’ means ‘renouncing
"
670,"Verse 13] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 633
the doership in actions through discrimination’. If the meaning of
the expression ts taken as ‘renouncing mental actions’ only, it will
not be proper, because according to the Gita, ‘renouncing mental -
action’ mentally, is also an activity of the mind (Gita 18/15). So, there
is doership of this mental activity. Therefore the renouncement
of actions mentally, means renouncing the affinity of doership
through discrimination. A Sankhyayogi does not regard himself,
as the doer, he leaves the doership in the body. |
'Naiva kurvanna karayan'—A Sankhyayogi becomes, neither
a doer himself, nor does he make others, doers. As he is, not in
the least attached to the body, senses, mind and intellect etc., he
cannot regard actions performed by them, as his. In the eighth
verse of this chapter also the Lord has pointed out the same fact,
when He declares, ""The man who knows the truth, thinks that -
he does nothing at all."" In the thirty-first verse of the thirteenth |
chapter, also He declares, ""The Supreme Self dwelling in the . _
body, does not act.""
Here a doubt arises, that it is true that the self does not -
perform actions, but it can inspire others to perform actions.
The clarification is, that as with the rise of the sun, people are
engaged in different activities, such as farming, study and business
etc., even though the sun does not cause them to perform, either
prescribed or prohibited actions. Had the sun, itself caused them —
to act, then it would have been responsible for their virtues
and sins. Similarly, 'prakrti', derives its existence and power,
from God, but He never causes it, to act. This fact, has been
described by the Lord by the expression 'Na karyan', so does
nature, having received power from God or Self, function, but
the self does not inspire anyone to act.
‘Aste sukham'—All human beings, dwell naturally, in the
self. But they believe that they rest, in the body, senses, mind,
intellect and life-breath. So they cannot realize the reality, that
they rest in the Self. But a Sankhyayog!, realizes that he rests in
"
671,"634 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 5
the self, which is perfect and uniform, and this belief involves
no labour..So, here the word 'Aste’ (rests) has been used, while
- in the twenty-fourth verse of the fourteenth chapter, the term
_ “Svasthah' (dwells or rests in the self) has been, used. | - |
| The self, is the origin of all origins and it needs, no base.
This state of ‘resting in the self’, has also been conveyed, in
the twentieth verse, by the expression, ""Such a knower of God,
rests in God.""
Appendix—‘Naiva kurvanna karayan’—-The idea to do an
- action is an obstacle to Self-realization. The feeling of performing
an action causes the sense of doership and the sense of doership
leads. to individuality. Performance of action is in Prakrti, in
_ the self there is actionlessness. Therefore performance of action
connects us with Prakrti and by non-performance of action we _
get established in the self. ‘I have to do nothing’—this notion
is also within the area of the performance of action. Therefore -
a striver should have nothing to do with the performance of an -
action or its non-performance—‘naiva tasya krtenartho nakrteneha
_ kagcana’ (Gita 3/18). The self is free from performance of an _
action or its non-performance viz., it is a transcendental entity.
‘Vasi’—By attachment to the modes of Prakrti a man becomes
_ “avaga’ viz., helpless (Gita 3/5). This helplessness is wiped out
by Jnanayoga and the man becomes ‘vasi’ viz., his life becomes
independent and transcendental.

: Neither the sense of doership nor the nature of actions
does the Lord determine for the mankind, nor does He link
actions with their fruits. But it is the personal nature alone,
that impacts. 14 ,
Comment:—
‘Na kartrtvam na karmani lokasya srjati prabhuh'—The term
""Prabhuh’, has been used here, because the universe is created |
by the Lord, Who is endowed with attributes. He is omnipotent
and He controls, the entire universe. Though, He conducts the
activities of the entire universe, yet He remains, a non-doer
(Gita 4/13). -
All actions, are performed by the modes of nature, but out —
of ignorance, a man identifies himself with nature and becomes ;
a doer of actions, which are done by nature in fact (Gita 3/27). -
God has not made man the doer. If He had made him the doer,
the Lord, in the eighth verse of this chapter, would not have _
said—-The man, who is united with the Divine, and knows the
truth thinks, ""I do nothing at all."" It means, that this sense of
doership is self-made, and so it can be renounced by the man,
who has inculcated it.
The Lord, does not decree whether a person, will have
to perform a particular virtuous or evil deed. Had it been so
decreed by Him, the prescribed and prohibited actions mentioned
by scriptures, preceptors etc., would have been of no avail, and
a man would not have had to bear, the fruit of his actions. The
expression 'Na karmani’, proves that a man is independent, in
the performance of actions.
‘Na karmaphalasarhnyogam'—A man, has to reap the fruit
of actions, which he performs. Actions, being insentient cannot
decide upon their result. So, it is ordained by God (Gita 7/22).
The Lord, awards the fruit of actions, but He does not bring
"
673,"636 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 5
about union with fruit of actions. It is the man, who brings
about this union. He,. out of ignorance, having become a doer
and having been attached to fruit of actions, has to feel happy, -— --~~.--~-
and sad. If he himself, does not get attached to fruit of actions,
he can be free, from it. The term ""Sannydsinam' (renouncers),
in the twelfth verse of the eighteenth chapter, has been used, for

_ such persons who are not attached to the fruit of actions. They
have not to reap the fruits of their actions, here or hereafter. If
God had connected actions with their fruit, a man would have,
never been liberated, from the fruit of actions.

In the, forty-seventh verse of the second chapter, the Lord
declares, ""Let the fruit of action, not be thy motive."" It means,
that it depends upon a man, whether he feels happy or sad and
whether the fruit of action is his motive or not? If the Lord -
had ordained the fruit of action then a man would have never —
become even-minded in pleasure and pain, and he would have ~
never performed actions having abandoned attachment, or the —
fruit of actions, which has been emphasized by the Lord, time
and again in the Gita (vide 4/20, 5/12, 14/24 etc.). -

Question:—In the scriptures, it is mentioned that the Lord

~ Causes those, whom He wants to send to the higher worlds, to
perform virtuous actions, while He causes those whom He wants
to send to the lower worlds, to perform, evil actions. Thus the
declaration, ""Neither agency nor actions does the Lord create
nor does, He connect actions, with their fruits,"" seems contrary
to the ordinance of the scriptures.

Answer:—In fact, the scriptures do not.mean, that the Lord
sends them to the higher or lower worlds, by causing them to
perform virtuous or evil actions, but these mean, that the Lord
purifies them by enabling them to reap the fruit of their past actions
by creating circumstances* so that, they may attain God or His love.

* Being overpowered by desire a man performs good (virtuous) and bad
(evil), actions (Gita 3/37) which lead him to the higher worlds (heaven etc.,)
"
674,"Verse 14] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 637

If the scriptures are interpreted, in the way, that the Lord causes
people to perform virtuous or evil actions, so that they may go
to higher or lower worlds, then man, will become dependent, in Se
performing actions. Prescription and prohibition by the scriptures
and saints, and instruction of the preceptors, will prove to be
futile. So this interpretation, does not seem to be justified.

'Svabhavastu pravartate'—It is, because of his nature, that
man becomes a doer, performs actions and connects actions,
with their fruit. Man himself, is responsible, to form this nature.

So long as, there are attachment and aversion in nature, it is
not purified; and as long as nature, is not purified, a man is
overpowered, by nature.

The Lord, mentions here the same fact, which he has already
stated in the thirty-third verse of the third chapter, when He -
declared, ""Beings follow their nature.""

So long as, a man acts according to his nature, he will -
become. a doer, will perform actions and will link actions, ‘with -
their fruit. Thus, he will remain dependent, and this dependence
is self-created. If man renounces doership, actions and association _
of actions, with fruit which he has made himself, he can realize
that he is ever untainted (uncontaminated).

Appendix—The sense of doership, action and attachment to
the fruit of action—it is not God’s creation, but it is the man’s
(embodied soul’s) own creation. Therefore the man is responsible
for its renunciation also.

‘Svabhavastu pravartate’—In fact renunciation of affinity for
the world is natural; but because of the perception of naturalness
in unnaturalness, affinity for the world is seen natural. This
individual nature is not natural and untainted but it is one’s
own creation.

Comment:—
'Nadatte kasyacitpapam na caiva sukrtam vibhuh’'—The Lord, -
Who has been termed ‘Prabhuh’, in the preceding verse, has been ;
called 'Vibhuh', here. | 7
| A man, can reap the fruit of action in two ways, by performing
actions himself, or by causing others to perform actions. But, _
the Lord neither performs actions, nor does He cause others to
perform these. So, He has not to reap their fruit.
The sun, provides light to the entire universe and men commit
sins and also perform virtuous actions, but the sun has nothing
to do, with those sinful or virtuous actions. Similarly, nature
and the entire universe, receive power from God and with that
power people perform virtuous and sinful actions. But, those
actions performed by the people, have not the least connection,
with God. The Lord, has given freedom to man, whether he
connects actions with their fruits, or offers actions and their
fruit, to God. He who, by misusing the freedom given by the
Lord, becomes a doer and reaps the fruits of actions, is bound.
The Lord, does not accept these actions and their fruit as His.
But he, who by making right use of freedom, offers his actions
"
676,"Verse 15] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 639
and their fruit to God, is liberated, and the Lord accepts such
actions, and their fruits. : |
As, in the twenty-fifth verse of the seventh chapter, by the ~
term 'sarvasya’ (all), and, in the twenty-sixth verse of the same
chapter, by the term 'KaScana’ (anyone), the Lord has talked
about common people, so has He described by the term ‘Kasyacit'
common people, who regard themselves, as doers and enjoyers
of fruits, rather than about devotees. As far as, devotees are
concerned, the Lord accepts a leaf, a flower, a fruit or a little
water, which is offered to Him, with devotion (Gita 9/26-27).
'Ajanenavrtam jnanam'—The knowledge of the self, is
self-evident to all the people, but this knowledge is enveloped
in ignorance. It is because of this ignorance that beings are
deluded. He, who thinks 'T am the doer’, is deluded (Gita 3/27). -
A man, can wipe out this delusion by discrimination, which
has been bestowed upon him by God. Therefore, in the eighth .
verse of this chapter, it has been said, that a Sankhyayogi should -
ever think, ""I do nothing at all"", while, in the thirteenth verse
it has been said, that he should mentally renounce, all actions ~
by discrimination. 7
All objects, such as a body etc., are constantly undergoing
change, while the self, never experiences any change. When a
man identifies the self, with kaleidoscopic objects, it means,
that he is swayed by ignorance. But, when he realizes that the
self is different, from the kaleidoscopic worldly materials, his
ignorance is wiped out and the knowledge of the self, 1s illumined
automatically. The reason is, that knowledge of the self is veiled,
when one assumes affinity with the evolutes of Nature.
The term 'Ajnana’, does not mean total absence of knowledge,
but it means imperfect knowledge, as there cannot be, total
absence of knowledge. Knowledge of the senses and intellect,
is also imperfect. When a person, attaches importance to this
imperfect knowledge, and is influenced by it, he does not keep
"
677,"— 640 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
an eye on real knowledge—this is known as ‘enveloping of the
knowledge, by ignorance’.
The knowledge of intellect, is more extensive, than that of _
- senses, or that of the mind. The knowledge of intellect; illumines,
the knowledge of the mind and senses, but it cannot illumine
nature, whose evolute it is. When it cannot even illumine Nature,
how can it illumine the sentient, which transcends Nature? Thus,
° the knowledge of intellect, is imperfect. |
: 'Tena muhyanti jantayah.'.—The Lord, by using the term
‘Jantavah'’, has condemned human beings, by saying that those
persons, who do not attach importance to discrimination, are
in fact, animals, because without discrimination there is no
difference, between the two.* A-human being, is a human being
not merely by virtue of human form, but because of his sense of _
discrimination. As far as sensual pleasures are concerned, even
animals enjoy these. But, the aim of human life, is not to hanker -
after them instead, it is to realize, the self or God, Who is free -
from pleasure or pain. Those who know, what ought to be done
and what ought not to be done, deserve to be called strivers. _
He, who believes that he is a doer, and who having the
motive of fruit of action, feels happy or sad—such a man, is said.
to be, deluded out of ignorance.. We are forced to do virtuous
and evil actions. How can we get rid of them? To be happy and
to be sad, is the fruit of our actions. How can we rise above
these? To have such conviction, is delusion.
: Man, (self) is a non-doer, and is also, free from pleasures
and pain. It is out of ignorance, that he becomes a doer and feels
happy or sad, by bringing about union with fruit of actions. The
term ‘tena’, stands for this delusion (ignorance). The ignorant,
out. of delusion feel happy and sad. The same fact, has been
* Food, sleep, fear and sex are common between men and animals. Men
are superior to animals because of their sense of discrimination. Without
discrimination they are just like animals (Canakyaniti 17/17).
"
678,"Verse 15] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 641
pointed out, by the expression ‘tena muhyanti jantavah' (by that,
beings are deluded). .
_ Appendix—As the dark has no power to cover the sun, so a -

has ignorance no power to cover knowledge. The unnatural has
been assumed as natural—this is ignorance by which a man
is deluded. Therefore this is merely a notion, not a fact that
knowledge is covered by ‘ignorance. If a man so desires, then
by attaching importarice to his discrimination, he can destroy
this delusion (ignorance) (Gita 5/16).

In fact knowledge is not covered but intellect is covered. But
to a man, knowledge appears to be covered; therefore here the
term ‘avrta’ has been used. The same fact has been mentioned
in the thirty-ninth verse of the third chapter by the expression
‘Avrtamn jiianametena’ (Gita 3/39). Ignorance is non-existent or -
a negation. It has no existence. A non-existent thing cannot veil
the knowledge. Therefore opposite knowledge viz., perception |
of naturalness in unnaturalness is ignorance*. If the vision of -
unnaturalness is discarded, naturalness automatically reveals
itself, then a man will realize his identity with omnipresent -
God. It is because of individuality that sins and virtues attach
to us; therefore having realized identity with the omnipresent
God viz., by the destruction of individuality, sins and virtues
no more attach to us.

Because of ignorance viz., opposite knowledge (natural intellect
in the unnatural) a man becomes ‘jantu’ (animal)—‘tena muhyanti
jantavah.’ Similarly the embodied soul because of its affinity for
matter (non-self) becomes ‘Jagat’ (world) (matter) (Gita 7/13).

We have regarded the Lord Who is ever identified with us
(the self) as separate and we have assumed the body which is
different from us as identified with us—this is ignorance.

the sun. 16 :
Comment:— -
‘Jiianena tu tadajiianam yesam nasitamatmanah'—The term .
'Tu' (but), has been used to show that, in this verse there is _
description of something different, from the preceding verse.
Whatever, was called 'Ajfidnena' in the preceding verse, has _
been called here ‘tat ajiianam' (that ignorance).
Ignorance, consists in identifying the self with the body,
while knowledge comprises in regarding these as two separate
entities.
If we have an egoistic notion and a sense of mine with the
body and the world—this is ignorance. The self, ever remains
the same, while a sense of 'T and the sense of ‘mine’, change.
In the past, we were children and toys were very dear to us,
but now we are young or old and regard, our wives, sons and
riches etc., as ours. Thus, we see that the sense of 'T', and of
‘mine’, are undergoing change while the self, ever remains the
same. That is knowledge, or discrimination.
The perception of the eternal in the transitory, of the pure in the impure, of
pleasure in pain and of the self in the non-self is ignorance.
"
680,"Verse 16] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 643
Thus a striver should realize this reality through discrimination,
and renounce the sense of ‘I’ and that of 'mine’. This is called !
destruction of ignorance, by knowledge. A person, identifies the _
uniform self, with the kaleidoscopic world etc., because, he does |
not attach importance to discrimination. A striver, who having |
aroused this discrimination, renounces the sense of 'T' and that of |
‘mine’ with the perishable world, his discrimination lights up the
supreme Self, 1.e., he realizes God, who is Truth-Consciousness- :
Bliss consolidated. ) ,
'Tesamadityavajjianam. prakaSayati tatparam'-—-When
discrimination is fully aroused, a striver has no affinity, at all
for the kaleidoscopic world. Then he realizes the self, and then
the Supreme-Self is illumined i.e., the Self realizes Its identity
with the Supreme-Self. | |
The word ‘param’, here as well as, in the fifty-ninth verse of the
second chapter and the thirty-fourth verse of the thirteenth chapter, _
has been used for the Supreme (Supreme-Self or God). -
The term 'prakaSayati’, signifies that, as in the dark, objects are
not seen, but these are noticed when the sun rises, so is the Supreme- 7
Self, Who is ever-attained is not realized because of ignorance.
As soon as ignorance is destroyed, the Supreme-Self, is realized.
Appendix—lIgnorance is destroyed only by discrimination,
not by effort—‘yatanto’ pyakrtatmano nainarh paSyantyacetasah’
(Gita 15/11). The reason is that destruction of ignorance is not
possible by the performance of action and by doing labour. By
doing labour, affinity for the body persists because without having.
connection with the body, no labour is done. Secondly by making
effort to wipe out ignorance, ignorance is strengthened, because an
effort is made to wipe it out only when we accept its existence.
The opposite notion (ignorance) of naturalness in unnaturalness
is self-made. By attaching importance to discrimination that
ignorance is removed.

Comment:— |
[God can be realized by two means—first, He (the reality)
can be realized by renouncing the unreal through discrimination, —
and secondly, by thirst for the real. The unreal can be attained
through actions, rather than through thirst. How God can be
realized through thirst, is explained in this verse.] -
'Tadbuddhayah'—A striver, through intellect should have
a conviction, that the Lord pervades everywhere. He existed -
before the world was created, exists now and will also exist if
the world is being destroyed. This is known as absorbing of the
intellect in Him.
'Tadatmanah'—Here the term ‘Atma’, stands, for the mind.
When a striver resolves, that only the Lord pervades everywhere,
his mind automatically thinks of Him only.
'Tannisthah'—When the mind and the intellect of a striver,
are absorbed in God, he realizes that he is naturally established
in Him. But, so long as, the mind and the intellect do not get
absorbed in God i.e., a striver, does not think and resolve, of
His all-pervasive nature, he cannot realize, that he is naturally
established, in Him.
'Tatparayanah'—Such strivers, instead of having a separate
"
682,"Verse 17] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 645
entity, become one with God. Their identity is merged in God,
and thus they become an embodiment of God.
_ Unless the striver, and the spiritual practice become one, BS
the discipline is not continuous. But, when the striver loses his
egoistic notions, his means merges in the end, because both of
these are identical.
‘Jnananirdhitakalmasah'—Through discrimination (wisdom
or knowledge), between the real and the unreal, a striver gets rid
of the unreal. It is because of his affinity for the unreal, that he
commits sins, and is bound. When his affinity for the unreal is
totally renounced, his sins and virtues, are totally wiped out.
'Gacchantyapunaravrttim'—Attachment to the unreal, is the
cause of rebirth. The Lord declares, ""Attachment to the modes, is
the cause of soul's birth, in good and evil wombs"" (Gita 13/21). -
When our attachment for the unreal is wiped out, there is no
question of our return, to the mortal world. |
A thing, which is finite, moves from one place to another,
but one, which is all-pervasive, wherefrom is it to come and
whither is it to go. God pervades all space, time, objects, -
circumstances, equally. He never moves, and so is the case with
great souls, as they have identified themselves with Him. They
also do not move. The scriptures declare— A God-realized soul,
here and now, merges in God. His vital force, does not migrate
(Brhadaranyaka 4/4/6).
Regarding his so-called body, it is said that he is not reborn.
In fact, the term 'Gacchantt' (go) stands for acquiring the knowledge
of the self, which immediately leads to realization of God who
is ever-realized.
Appendix—When the notion of naturalness in unnaturalness
is wiped out, then no other independent existence besides God
persists and a striver becomes the embodiment of God which
is really axiomatic. Therefore there is no question of his return

Suni caiva Svapake ca panditah samadarSinah
Sages equate a learned and humble brahmana, a cow, an |
elephant or even a dog, or a lowly (outcaste), as these have a
vision of God, in all of them. 18
Comment:— -
""Vidyavinayasampanne brahmane gavi hastini Suni caiva Svapake
| ca panditah samadarsinah'—Here, two adjectives ‘learned’ and _
‘humble’, have been used for Brahmana, in order to show his
perfection, as generally a learned person is not humble, and he
becomes proud of his learning. 7
Dealings of a sage with a learned brahmana, a pariah, a
cow, an elephant and a dog would be different. Equal dealings
are neither proper nor possible. The scriptures also support this
view. A learned and humble brahmana, rather than a pariah is
adored, milk is drunk of a cow, rather than of a bitch, while
an elephant rather than a dog can be used for riding. When the
Lord says, that sages see them with an equal eye, He means to
say, that they behold the Lord, pervading everywhere. Therefore,
they do not see with an unequal eye.
Here, a doubt may arise, how can their dealings be different,
if they have an equal eye? The explanation is, that we see all
the parts of our body (forehead, feet, hands and anus etc.,) with
an equal eye and think of their welfare, yet our dealings with
"
684,"Verse 18] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 647
these are different. When anyone is touched with our feet we
feel sorry and beg his pardon, but we do not do so if he is
touched with our arm. We show reverence for others, by bowing _ -
our head and folding hands, rather than feet. A hand has to be
washed, if it touches anus, but it is not washed, if it touches a
hand. Showing the forefinger and the thumb to someone, have
different meanings, which are well-known to all. In this way, a
man has different dealings with different parts of the body, but
he loves them equally. He, is not indifferent to any afflicted limb.
He, through the likeness of the self, sees equality everywhere,
be it pleasure or pain (Gita 6/32). In this way, the wise also
have different dealings with different beings according to the
difference in their food, qualities, conduct and caste etc., and it
is proper also. They behold the Lord, pervading everywhere and
so they love all beings and think of their welfare equally, without -
having any evil propensities, such as attachment, aversion, pride
and partiality etc. They have an automatic inclination, to remove _
the sufferings of other beings and to console and comfort them,
in the same way as a person tries to remove the pain of any
limb of his body. So, it is said that they see everyone, with an -
equal eye. The Lord, has mentioned of this equality of vision or
even-mindedness, several times in the Gita as ""He, who is equal-
minded, excels"" (6/9); ""He sees the same, everywhere"" (6/29);
“He, through the likeness of the self, sees equality everywhere""
(6/32); “Even-minded everywhere"" (12/4); ""He, who sees the
supreme Lord abiding equally in all beings, never perishing when
they perish, verily sees"" (13/27); and ""He sees the same Lord
equally dwelling everywhere” (13/28). |

Sti Sankaracarya declares:—

A man should be non-dual in feelings, rather than in dealings
(TattvopadeSa).

Now-a-days, people talk a lot, about equanimity. But it must
"
685,"648 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
be understood in the right perspective... .

Equanimity, is not child's play but an embodiment of God.
The Lord declares, ""Those, whose minds get rooted in equanimity, -
overcome the world (birth and death) and realize the Absolute _
(God)"" (Gita 5/19). This state of equanimity, is attained when
others’ pleasure and pain, become a striver's own pleasure and -
pain. The Lord declares, ""O Arjuna, he who through the likeness
of the self, sees equality (equanimity) everywhere, be it pleasure

Or pain, is considered a perfect Yogi"" (Gita 6/32). -

A striver, attains equanimity when he is engaged in removing
the suffering of others, in the same way, as he gets engaged
promptly in removing his own suffering. Explaining the marks
of a saint, Tulasidasa declares—

‘Saints feel happy and sad in the happiness and sadness, of -
others’ (Manasa 7/38/1). |

So long as, a man desires pleasure, he cannot attain equanimity,
in spite of his best efforts. But, when he has a keen desire to-
provide comfort to others, to do good to them, and he thinks
of their salvation, he becomes equanimous. A striver, should -
begin such activity, with his family. He should try his best to
remove the suffering of his parents, wife, sons and other near
and dear ones, even if he has himself to suffer. By doing so,
he will attain peace. Similarly, he should try to remove the
suffering of others. By doing so he will be thrilled with joy.
We should serve, those to whom we are not attached or we
should renounce our attachment for those, whom we serve—the
result will be the same. |

Saint Tulasidasa in the Manasa declares, ""Laksmana serves
Lord Rama and Sita with the same zeal, as that with which, an
ignorant man serves his body"" (2/142/1). |

It is not wise to serve one’s own body, because even an
animal does so. A mother-monkey, loves its youngone so much,
that it does not leave the youngone, even when the latter dies.
"
686,"Verse 18] -SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 649

But, when someone gives it any eatable, it eats itself, without

giving it to its youngone. Even if the youngone tries to eat, the

mother scares the youngone away, as long as attachment is there, —.

equanimity is out of the question. | -
We should serve others, in a disinterested manner. If anyone

goes astray, we should guide. him in a pleasant way to follow

the right path. By doing so, we shall feel peace and happiness.

If we do not guide him, we cannot experience peace. Let any

one try this and see. Similarly, if we invite a thirsty person to

_ have a drink of cold water, it gives us satisfaction, and peace |

of mind. This.kind of happiness or. peace leads us, to salvation

while the desire to seek pleasure, leads us to degradation. In the

same way, when religious discourses are arranged, we should

politely request people to take comfortable seats, so that they may ,

listen to the discourse properly, instead of commanding them, in — -

an authoritative tone. By doing so, we. shall derive satisfaction

and peace. But, if we command them in an authoritative tone, . _

it will reveal our pride which will prick others and we shall |

not be able to attain peace. By such behaviour, we can never

attain equanimity. |
Those, who are engrossed in the welfare of all beings attain .

the Lord (Gita 12/4) because He is a disinterested frend, of all

beings (Gita 5/29). It is He, Who rears all beings, whether they _

- are believers or non-believers. Water quenches the thirst, of both __

the staunch believer and non-believer, the sun, provides light to

both, air helps everyone to breathe, and the earth provides room

to everyone, without any distinction, whether they believe in

God or not. Thus, everybody has an equal share in the things,

created by God. _
Equanimity or equality, does.not mean that food should .

be eaten and marriages should be arranged without taking

into consideration caste, creed or colour etc. Equality, in such

_ dealings leads to degradation. It is, the god of death who has
"
687,"650 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
equal dealings with all, because all the beings whether they are
saints or householders, animals or gods, have to die. .

Animals also have equality of dealings. A dog enters a

brahmana's kitchen with unclean feet, in the same way as it - -
enters the kitchen of a sweeper, because it does not distinguish
between a brahmana and a sweeper. But the same behaviour
on the part of a man cannot be ignored. Equanimity, consists
in removing the suffering of others and in doing good to them.
This equanimity, purifies him and his heart. But if one does not
observe purity in food etc., his heart gets impure which leads
to disquietude. Superficial equality, is against the ordinance of
the scriptures and the decorum of society, and it causes conflict
in society.

The scriptures do not support the view that the brahmanas _ |
(priest class) are high by caste, while the Siidras (labour class)
are low. The brahmanas through preaching, the ksatriyas (the
watrior class) through protection (heroism), the vaisyas (the -
trading class) through trade, and the sidras (the labour class) |
through physical labour, should serve the members of all castes. -
But, it does not mean, that members of other castes should not do
physical labour, while performing their duty. All of them should
labour equally during the performance of their duty. Everyone
should render service to others and co-operate with them with
all the resources he possesses. |

In the past, people followed the varna (caste) system and

asrama (order of life) system and led a happy and peaceful life.
But today the Varnasrama system is being replaced by factions
and groups. In villages people cannot even get water because
the owners of the wells do not allow those people, who support
the candidates of the rival parties, to draw water from their
wells. Among the members of the same family also, there are
feuds because they support different parties. How miserable is
the condition! | | |
"
688,"Verse 19] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 651

If we want to attain equanimity, we should try to remove
the sufferings of others whether they belong to our caste, order
of life, religion or sect etc., or not, and should also do good to a
them. They may be, the devotees of Lord Rama or Lord Krsna or
Lord Siva or they may be muslims or christians etc., we should
equally think of their welfare. We should never be partial to the
people of our own caste or creed or group etc., nor should we
feel happy and sad, when our own group or creed gain victory
or suffer defeat over a rival group or creed etc. We should help
them and satisfy their needs, to the best of our capacity and
‘resources, without having feelings of envy, jealousy, hatred and
pride etc., as upliftment is possible through righteous feelings,
virtues and good conduct. Moreover, we should have the feelings
that all beings should be happy, and free from disease and none
should ever suffer, in the least. Having such feelings, we should -
do good to others—that is equanimity.

Appendix—-A Brahmana, a pariah, a cow, an elephant and a _
dog—{the bodies of) all these are changing every moment and
are going into non-existence but the reality ever abiding in them -
never changes, it ever remains the same. The wise perceive that
reality only. As an ant extracts grains of sugar mixed with sand,
in the same way the discerning eye of the wise perceives the real
entity pervading the unreal world. It means that whether there
is a Brahmana or a pariah, a cow or a dog, an elephant or an
ant; in all these heterogeneous beings, the wise have an equal
eye. In spite of inequality in their dealings, they have never an
inequal eye.

Even here, the whole world is conquered by those whose minds _ Oo
are vested in equanimity. As God is flawless and equal, therefore,
they become merged in God (Brahman). 19
Comment:—

'Yesam samye sthitam manah'—When a person realizes,
that he is established in God or Self, and when he renounces
attachment, aversion, desire and unevenness of mind etc., his
mind and intellect, naturally get established in equanimity.
Though outwardly there is no obvious difference between
the dealings of a great soul and a common man, yet inwardly
there is a lot of difference. The mind of a great soul remains
equanimous, flawless and quiet, while that of a common man,
uneven, defective and disquiet. -

In the morning, when the sun rises, it is not seen in the |
east if it is hidden behind high mountains, in that direction, -
but its light can be seen, on the top of a high mountain in the
west. It shows, that the sun has risen, even if it is not visible, -
in the east. Similarly, those, whose minds and intellects remain
untainted by honour and dishonour, praise and blame, pleasure
and pain, etc., and are free from attachment, aversion, joy and
sorrow, are naturally established, in the self. The reason is, that
for a person without being established in the self, it is impossible
to maintain evenness of mind and intellect.

‘Thaiva tairjitah sargah'—Here the plural has been used in
the term 'taih’, (by those) by the Lord, to explain that all men
can realize God and can conquer the entire world.

The expression ‘Tha eva’, means that even here, during a
lifetime, in this world, they can conquer the world 1.e., can be
liberated from this world.

The body, senses, mind, intellect, beings, objects, incidents
and circumstances etc., are all different from the self. He, who
"
690,"Verse 19] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 653
depends on them, is dependent. He, who attaches importance
to them, and desires them, remains dependent 1.e., is defeated. :
But when he renounces attachment to them, and sincerely gives - .
up desire for them, it means that he has overcome, them. Till,
slavery to desire persists, he is a vanquished, one.
Only, a defeated person wants to win over and subdue others.
In fact no one can defeat others, without subduing himself. For
example, if a king or a scholar, wants to defeat others, he will
have to resort to his army, capability, learning, wisdom etc.
A man, becomes dependent as soon as his desire is born.
This dependence remains, whether desire is satisfied or not. When
the desire is not satisfied, a person remains dependent for want
of the object of his desire. But, when that desire is satisfied,
he depends upon the object, he has acquired, though he does - |
not realize, this dependence because his intellect 1s veiled by
ignorance. He, feels himself to be independent. |
A wise man, becomes totally independent, because he has -
no desire at all, and such a man is victorious, though he has
no desire to overcome, others. He needs nothing, in the world, _
while the world needs him.
Such an equanimous great soul, who has overcome the world,
is not tempted by much mundane pleasure and is not shaken, even
by the heaviest sorrow (Gita 6/22). He has not the least desire for
any beings, objects and circumstances etc. Though he knows of
desirable and undesirable circumstances, and makes effort to be free
from the undesirable ones, yet they have no effect on his mind.
'Nirdosam hi samarh brahma'—All flaws and heterogeneity,
are found in a man, because, of his affinity for nature. But,
God is flawless, equanimous and unattached because, He has
no affinity for nature. |
""Tasmadbrahmani te sthitah'—God, is flawless and equanimous.
Therefore, great souls, whose minds are flawless and equanimous,
are established in God. a
"
691,"654 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
When a man is attached, to the kaleidoscopic and unreal
world, all flaws and heterogeneity are born. As great souls, do
not attach any importance to the unreal, they remain flawless and
equal and so they remain established in God. As, where there is
smoke there must be a fire, because without fire, smoke is not
possible; so are those, whose minds are established in equality,
established in God, because without being established in God,
full equanimity (equality) is not possible. |

When a man himself gets established in God, his mind is
also established in equanimity. It is only when, they have attained
the state of equanimity, that great souls are said to have attained,
God-realization or equanimity. This equanimity, has been called

_ Yoga in the Gita (2/48). According to the Gita, this attainment
of equanimity, is regarded as perfection of human life. __

The topic of Jianayoga (the Discipline of Knowledge), was
started in the thirteenth verse. The term ‘Jantavah' (beings or
animals), used in the plural number in the fifteenth verse, continued -
upto this nineteenth verse. The Lord, by using the plural number,
means to explain that all those people who are deluded, can attain _
God-realization. But, in the present verse the term, 'Brahmani'
has been used. in the singular, which indicates that all people
attain the same God. Every person, whether he is a brahmana
(member of the priest class) or a pariah, attains the same Lord,
Who was attained by great sages such as Sanaka etc.

Appendix—Here the term ‘mana’ should be interpreted as
intellect because it is not the mind which gets established in
equanimity but it is intellect which gets established. Mind is
concentrated in meditation. This is the topic of steadfast intellect.
Steadfastness of the mind persists only in meditation, not while
engaged in dealings but steadfastness of intellect persists constantly.

It is not the steadfastness of mind but the steadfastness of intellect
which leads to salvation. Steadfastness of mind brings about
‘Siddhis’ (mysterious accomplishments). Therefore steadfastness
"
692,"Verse 20] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 655
of the mind is not of so much value as is the steadfastness of
intellect. The Lord in the second chapter also has glorified a man
of steadfast wisdom (intellect). In the next verse also the Lord
has mentioned that an undeluded person with a firm intellect 7 -
becomes one with Brahma (God)—‘sthirabuddhirasammidho
brahmavid brahmani sthitah’. :
By error a striver may not think himself to be an enlightened
soul, therefore this mark has been mentioned that if there is no
equanimity. in intellect, one should understand that he has not
attained Self-realization, this is merely his misconception. The
mark of equanimity in intellect is—freedom from attachment
and aversion, pleasure and pain etc. Having realized the self,
equanimity ever persists in intellect. Intellect never deviates or
stirs from this equanimity. |
Those, whose intellect is established in equanimity, become -
free from attachment and aversion. Their equanimous intellect |
naturally remains firm in the fact that all is God. When there _
is no other entity besides God then who should have aversion
and towards whom? When.only that one ever-existent entity is
realized, then no desire persists, and no disquietude remains. -

_. ""Na prahrsyetpriyam prapya nodvijetprapya capriyam'—To get —
agreeable beings, objects, incidents and circumstances, appealing _
to the body, senses, mind, principles, caste, creed and scriptures,
is called acquisition of 'priya’ (agreeable) and what is contrary
to it. 1s ‘apriya' (disagreeable). When, a striver obtains pleasant
(desirable) beings, objects, and circumstances etc., according to
his desire, he should not feel happy. Similarly, when he meets.

| with unpleasant ones, he should. not be sad. He knows the
desirable and the undesirable ones, but he is neither attached

to the desirable nor has an aversion for, the undesirable. Mere
knowledge of. the agreeable and disagreeable, is not a flaw, if
one remains free from joy or grief. |

: The mind, knows the desirable (pleasant) and the undesirable
(unpleasant), while the doer becomes happy and sad. Though all
actions, are performed by the modes of nature, yet he whose
mind is deluded, by egoism thinks, ""I am the doer,"" feels happy _
and sad. But, he who knows the true character of the self (soul)
and the modes of nature, understands, that it is the modes, which -
are acting on the modes (Gita 3/28), So he knows, that he is
not the doer and thus there is no question for him (the self) to
be happy or sad.

‘Sthirabuddhih'—The self, can be known by the self, without
the help of the instruments, such as the body, senses, mind and
intellect etc. The knowledge, which is acquired with mind
and intellect etc., is imperfect, as it is neither permanent nor
certain (doubtless). But, the knowledge of the self by the self is
permanent, uniform and certain. A great soul, who has realized

_this knowledge of the self, by the self has such a balanced and
firm mind, that there remains, neither any doubt nor option nor

contrary feelings in it. So, he is called 'sthira-buddhih' (one with
firm intellect or understanding). a
_ ‘Asammiidhah'—Commonly, deluded people, do not behold

the omnipresent Lord, ever-pervading everywhere, they believe .
that the world (which is really transitory and unreal), is real.
But, the undeluded, are those who are completely free from -
such belief.
'‘Brahmavit'—God, cannot be realized by a person, who does |
not identify himself with Him. But, when he identifies himself
with Him, without having any separate entity, he realizes Him.
In God-realization, the liberated soul, the means and God, all ,
the three, become one. There remains no trio, only realization
is left. In fact, who has realized God—this cannot be explained.
The reason is, that such a liberated soul, becomes one with God
(Brahma), and he has not the least pride of his achievement, that
he has realized God.
""Brahmani sthitah'—In fact, all beings are essentially and 7
constantly established in Brahma (God), but by an error they
assume that they are established in body, senses, mind and intellect |
etc. So they cannot realize the truth, that they are established in -
Him. But a great soul, in all circumstances, realizes that he is
established in Him, naturally and constantly. | -
An object may be established in another object, but
establishment in God, is distinct from it. When a great soul
identifies himself with God, only God remains, he completely loses
his separate entity. So long as, he thinks that he is established
in Him, it means that he has not fully identified himself with
Him, and he still has finiteness. | | :
Appendix—In sound sleep and in a swoon a man’s affinity
for the body is renounced involuntarily viz., due to ignorance
the mind merges in ignorance. Therefore in these states a man
does not feel pleasant and unpleasant and also bodily pain etc.
But a liberated exalted soul renounces his affinity for the body
discriminately. Therefore he knows the pleasant and the unpleasant
and also bodily pain etc., but he does not feel rejoiced and
agitated, happy and sad in them. His dependence on the body,

sa brahmayogayuktatma sukhamaksayamasnute

When a person is no longer attached to external sense-objects,
he finds happiness in the self. Having completely merged himself _
with Brahma (God), he enjoys eternal bliss. 21
Comment:—

""‘Bahyasparsesvasaktatma—He, who, instead of being attached —
to the body, senses, mind, intellect, life-breath etc., as well as, to
objects of senses, such as sound and touch etc., is attached, only = -
to God, is known as, unattached to external contacts. A striver
whose attachment has not been totally wiped out, but whose aim
has been to wipe it out, should also be included among those
strivers, who have renounced attachment, as they quickly get rid
of it because of their firm resolve. |

This detachment is necessary, in order to attain the state
mentioned in the preceding verse, in which a striver neither
rejoices on obtaining, what is pleasant, nor grieves on getting
what is unpleasant. : |

So long as, a man is attached to sense-objects etc., internally
or externally, he cannot realize the self. All these objects are
transitory and constantly undergo change, but because of attachment
to them a man has not an eye on their kaleidoscopic nature and
derives pleasure out of them. But in fact they cannot provide
"
696,"Verse 21] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 659
pleasure; it is renunciation of affinity for them, which provides
pleasures. Therefore, a man feels pleasure in sound sleep when
he forgets his affinity for sense-objects.

A man, has a wrong notion that he cannot live without - |
external contacts, but in fact, he cannot live with constant
external contacts. To forget, all external contacts he sleeps. Thus
he regains freshness, vitality and health, which he can never get,
in the wakeful state. Therefore, he considers sleep very essential.

Energy, is gained through dissociation, with objects.

When a man goes to bed, he means to renounce his affinity
for external objects, as also, to work after waking from sleep. As
he attaches more importance to work, he does not pay attention
to the renunciation of his affinity, for objects. He sleeps and
awakes having affinity for objects.

It is very surprising that if a person who was our relative -
dies, our affinity, for him continues. The reason is, that the |
assumed affinity can be wiped out only, when the person who .
has assumed it, renounces it. As soon as, he renounces it, he
attains salvation, which is natural.

The affinity with external objects is unreal, while our affinity :
with God is real. A man, assumes his affinity with external
objects, in order to derive pleasure out of them. But it results
in sufferings (Gita 5/22). By realizing this fact, attachment to
external objects is destroyed.

""Vindatyatmani yatsukham'—When attachment to the external
objects is wiped out, a striver finds Sattvika happiness. Happiness
derived out of the affinity, for the external objects, is Rajas (of
the mode of passion). A person goes on enjoying this rajasa (of
the mode of passion) happiness, so long as he does not gain
sattvika (of the mode of goodness), happiness. When he ceases
attachment to the rajasa happiness he gains sattvika happiness.

‘Sa brahmayogayuktatma'—As soon as attachment for the
world is lost, a striver identifies himself, with Brahma (God). As
"
697,"660 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
with the disappearance of darkness, light is revealed, so when
attachment to the world is erased, the striver is identified with
Brahma. Both, happen simultaneously. Yet disappearance of
darkness, is prior to ilumination of light—it is deemed so. Similar, —~
is the case with effacement of attachment and establishment in
God. In the first verse of the thirteenth chapter, it is described,
that the knower of the field (the self), is different from the field
(body), while in the second verse it is said, that the self has Its
identity with the Supreme Self. Similarly, in this verse by the
expression 'bahyasparSesvasaktatma’ (with the self unattached to
external contact), it is explained that the self is different from
the body and the world, this expression 'Brahmayogayuktatma,
elucidates the identity of the self with God. |
Having become detached from pleasure and having found
sattvika happiness, a striver may have a subtle egoistic notion, __
by thinking ‘I am happy’, 'I am wise’, 'I am flawless’, I have
no duty to perform' and so on. In order to get rid of this subtle =_
egoistic notion, it is necessary that a striver, should identify
himself with God totally, otherwise he cannot remain totally
free, from the sense of individuality. -
'‘Sukhamaksayamasnute'—So long as, a striver goes on enjoying
sattvika pleasure, he has egoism (attachment), in subtle form.
But, when he ceases to enjoy this sattvika happiness, his egoism
perishes totally and he realizes God, Who is sentient, uniform
and imperishable. This is known, as eternal bliss. This is also
called infinite bliss (6/21; 6/28), absolute bliss (14/27) and so
on. Having attained this eternal bliss, there is natural attraction
for God, and this attraction is known as supreme devotion
(Gita 18/54). This devotion ever-increases i.e., the Lord, seems to
be revealed in new forms, to such a devotee. In this connection,
there is a point which needs attention. If a striver, thinks that
his devotion was imperfect in the past, but now it has attained
perfection, it means that the striver has not attained perfection,
"
698,"Verse 22] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 661
as he is an aspirant still. But, if in spite of perceiving novelty
in the Lord, he feels that his devotion was supreme in the past
also, it means that he has attained perfection. - -

The pleasures that are born of attachment (with objects), are
only sources of pain, these have a beginning and an end, O son of
Kunti (Arjuna), no wise man finds happiness in them. 22 - |
Comment:—
""Ye hi sarhsparsaja bhogah'—Pleasure is derived from the _
contact of senses, with their objects—sound, touch, colour, taste
and smell. A man, also derives pleasure out of honour, praise,
beings, objects, circumstances etc. Man is not free in acquiring |
sense-objects. If somebody, eulogizes the doctrines we respect,
we feel happy—that is also a sort of enjoyment. It means, to
derive pleasure through beings, objects, circumstances and states
by body, senses and mind is known, as 'bhoga' (enjoyment).
Not only the forbidden pleasure, but also those which
are sanctioned by the scriptures, must also be renounced,
because these are obstacles, to God-realization. Pleasure can be
derived, only by having affinity for insentient (matter), while
it is a must to renounce affinity, for the insentient (matter), to
attain God-realization.
'Adyantavantah'—All the pleasures have a beginning and
"
699,"662 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5

an end, these are impermanent, kaleidoscopic (Gita 2/14) and
insentient, while the self is permanent, unchanging and sentient.
The sense-objects never identify with the self, therefore, the self
cannot gain happiness from pleasure. The self, is a fragment of —
God (Gita 15/7), therefore, it can attain eternal bliss from God
(Gita 5/21) alone. . .

As soon as, a person realizes, that these pleasures have a
beginning and an end, are transitory, and fleeting, the effect of
pleasure and pain, is lessened for him. Therefore, the expression
‘adyantavantah’, is a panacea, to root out the effect of pleasure.

""Duhkhayonaya eva te'—All the pleasures born of contacts,
are only sources of pain. Pleasure is born of pain and ends in
pain. A man feels happy having acquired a thing, in the same
proportion as its lacking was causing pain to him, and again
feels sad having lost it. -

| A libertine cannot escape pains or sorrows, because sensual
pleasures can be enjoyed by having affinity for the insentient _
(matter); and this affinity, for the insentient is the cause of great
suffering, in the form of birth and death.

| In the 'Patafijalayogadarsana’, it is stated, ""A wise man does __

not indulge in pleasures, because these result in three kinds
of pains. These pains are called 'parinamaduhkha’ (pain as a.
result), ‘tapaduhkha (affliction) and 'sarnskaraduhkha'. Moreover,
contradictions in the modes of nature, also result in pain.

Sensual pleasures, which appear like nectar at first, are like
poison in the end (Gita 18/38), because in enjoying these, energy
and objects are lost. So the result is pain. This is '‘parinamaduhkha.'

When a person, beholds others enjoying those pleasures which
he cannot enjoy, because he does not possess those objects, or
when he is afraid to lose them or when he is incapable of enjoying
these in spite of his attachment for them, he is filled with grief,
in spite of the fact, that the objects are available to him. This is
‘tapaduhkha’. He remembers the lost pleasures—this is pain, in the
"
700,"Verse 22] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 663
form of latent impressions. This is called 'sarnskaraduhkha’.
A person, wants to enjoy pleasure because of his inclination
to them, but his discrimination checks him from enjoying them. -
Similarly, while listening to divine discourses, because of the |
mode of ignorance, he feels sleepy he wants to derive pleasure,
from sleep. But because of the mode of goodness, he thinks that
he should avail himself of such golden opportunities, which are
very rare. Thus there is a contradiction or say tussel in the modes
of nature and this internal fight is very painful for strivers.
In the enjoyment of pleasure, a person is dependent because
these can be enjoyed according to one's fate, while he is independent
in God-realization, as this human body has been bestowed upon
him, only to attam Him. Pleasure cannot be enjoyed equally,
even by two persons, while God can be realized by everyone, -
even in this Kali-age, as He was realized in the Satya-age, by
great sages. Pleasures cannot be enjoyed forever, by all persons, |
while God can be realized forever, by everybody. It means, that -
there is a difference in acquiring pleasure i.e., all people cannot
acquire these. But, there is no difference, as for as renunciation -
of pleasures is concerned, all can renounce pleasure.
The word ‘eva’ means that pleasure is, doubtlessly and
certainly, a source of pain. There seems to be happiness, in
them but in reality, there is none in the least.
""Na tesu ramate budhah'—-A wise man, unlike a common
man does not delight in pleasure, because he regards these as
sources of pain. He, does not become a slave to them.
A wise man, knows that all the sorrow, suffering, sin and
hell etc., depend, on a desire for pleasure. Therefore, he who
attaches importance, to this knowledge, is wise. He, who knows
that pleasures are sources of pain, yet, desire them and delight in
them, does not deserve to be called, wise as a wise man, neither
desire nor takes delight in them.
Appendix—The pleasure derived from contact with objects,
"
701,"664 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
| _ persons and actions, is the root of sorrows. He, who enjoys
pleasures, has to suffer pain—it is the rule. In fact the hope, the
desire for pleasures and taking enjoyments, don’t provide happiness _
but they provide sadness. The union of pleasures is transient
and their disunion is eternal. A man by attaching importance
to the transient feels sad. He should think whether the. desire
for pleasure will provide pleasure and end his sufferings. The
desire for pleasure neither provides pleasure nor ends sufferings.
The desire for pleasure in order to wipe out pain, is the root
of pain.
One is—‘suffering pain’ and one is—‘effect of the pain’.
When a man suffers pain, then he has a desire for pleasure;
and when he has the effect of pain, then the desire for pleasure
is wiped out and he has a distaste for pleasure. By suffering
pain, a man feels sad and by the effect of pain, he rises above _
pain. Because of the effect of pain, instead of being engrossed
in pain, he thinks of its reason why he has to suffer pain. By _
reflecting upon it, he comes to know that except attachment to —
pleasure, there neither is, nor was, nor will be, nor can be any
other reason. Any circumstances are also not the reason because _
the circumstances do not ‘stay even for a moment. No person
can cause us pain because he destroys our old sins and enables
us to progress further. The world is also not the cause of pain
because whatever change takes place, is not to provide us pain
but it is to enable us to progress. If there is no change, how
will development take place? Without change how will a seed
grow into a tree? How will Ovum-Semen make a body? How >
will a baby become a youth? How will a fool become learned?
How will a patient become healthy? It means that natural change
leads to development. In the world, change is the quintessence of
progress. Without change, the world would have become static
and motionless like picture. Therefore change is not to be blamed
but the desire to derive pleasure from this change is to be blamed.
God is also not the cause of pain because He is the abode of
"
702,"Verse 23] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 665
bliss, in Him there is not even an iota (trace) of pain. |
‘Na tesu ramate budhah’—A wise (discriminating) man
‘does not delight in pleasures because the desire for pleasure -
is the constant enemy of the wise ‘jnanino nityavairina’ (Gita
3/39). An ignorant person likes pleasures because vices appear :
as virtues because of indiscrimination. All pleasures are born of
evils. If there. 1s no blemish in the inner sense, there cannot be :
any pleasure taking. Only a wise person can perceive his flaws. |
Therefore he does not take delight in pleasures viz., does not |
enjoy pleasures. |
A wise (discriminating) man has no desire for the thing which oO
does not stay with him forever. By using his discrimination he
accepts the truth, “Anything, person, ability and power which
acquired, are neither mine nor for me. Not only this but in infinite -
universes, there is not anything which is mine and which is for
me. Even the most loving thing is not mine forever and will not
stay with me forever.” Therefore a wise man determines that he -
can live happily forever without the objects and persons that are |
not likely to stay with him forever. : -

Comment:— |

‘Saknotihaiva yah sodhum prakSariravimoksanat
kamakrodhodbhavarh vegam'—Every being, possesses unusual -
discrimination but it remains latent in birds and beasts etc., who
know only how to maintain their body. In the life of gods etc., this
discrimination remains concealed because these-bodies are for the
enjoyment of pleasures. In human life also, the discrimination of
those, who hanker after pleasure and prosperity, remains veiled,
but time and again, their sense of discrimination, makes them
realise that pleasure and prosperity, result in pain and sin. A
person, remains entangled in them, because he does not attach
importance to discrimination. Therefore, a person by attaching
importance to discrimination, should make it a permanent feature;
and he has no restriction in doing so. By that he can be free from
evil propensities, such as attachment, aversion, desire, anger etc. -
Therefore, by using the term ‘Tha’ (here) in this world the Lord
exhorts human beings to resist the impulses of desire and anger, _
so that they may be happy forever, by controlling them.

This human body, has been bestowed upon us, so that _
having controlled the impulse of desire and anger, we may attain
salvation. Every human being, without any distinction of caste,
colour or creed etc., is qualified and deserving in controlling
these impulses. | |

A man could die at any moment. So he should be ever
cautious, not to be swayed by desire and anger, and he should
control these, here in this life, before giving up the body. Secondly,
it can also be interpreted that before the body starts functioning
under their sway, these should be controlled.

As soon as, the thought of hankering after pleasure comes
to the mind, a striver, should become alert, that he is a striver
and so it is not proper for him to get entangled in pleasure. He
should immediately renounce such thoughts.

It is because of attachment to objects—believing that these
"
704,"Verse 23] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 667

are beautiful and give pleasure, that—such thoughts crop up. Such

thoughts, give rise to desire to acquire them and we get angry

with persons, who create obstacles, in their acquisition. -
As soon as thoughts of desire and anger come to mind, these

should be renounced otherwise, later it becomes very difficult

to control these urges. As soon as, a thought arises, there is

disquietude, excitement and struggle etc., in the mind. So such

a man cannot be happy. But when he resists these impulses, he

becomes happy. Sometimes, a person can control these impulses

out of fear, in the presence of another man who may be more

powerful, than he. Similarly, he can control these out of greed,

in business etc., in order to earn money. But, this control cannot

make him happy, because in such cases, instead of getting

entangled in desire and anger, he gets caught in fear and greed. -

Moreover, a person, who resists impulses of desire and anger, :

has been called a Yogi. But, no one becomes a Yogi, who has

not renounced thoughts (Gita 6/2). Therefore, for a striver it 1s -

better to renounce thought, as soon as, it comes to the mind,

rather than to resist the impulses of desire and anger. -
A striver, can control desire and anger by realizing the fact

that these are not inherent in him, as the self is permanent, while

they are transitory. Secondly, how can these be in him, when he

knows that he is different from them? Thirdly, a person can be

free from desire and anger (Gita 5/26; 16/22) it means that only

he who is 1n reality free from them, can be free. Fourthly, the

Lord has called desire and anger (the gross forms of attachment

and aversion), the modification of nature (Gita 13/6). So they

remain in nature (prakrti), not in the self, as the self does not |

undergo any modification. Thus, desire and anger do not abide

in the self. He who considers them abiding in the self, invites

them to overcome him.
‘Sa yuktah narah'—The Lord, in the fifteenth verse of this

chapter, has called such persons, '‘Jantavah' (animals), whose
"
705,"668 | SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
knowledge is veiled by ignorance. Here, He has called a person,
who controls the impulses of desire and anger, 'narah' (a man).
It means, that only he who has controlled these urges, deserves
to be called, a man, otherwise, he is just like an animal. -

He, who remains established in equanimity, is called a Yogi. —
He, who by attaching importance to discrimination is not swayed by
desire and anger, is established in equanimity (even-mindedness).

‘Sa sukhi'—Not to talk of men, even birds and beasts cannot
lead a happy and peaceful life, if they are swayed by desire and
anger. So, only a man, who has controlled these impulses is happy,
otherwise evils such as disquietude, volatility and struggles are
born and a man cannot be happy. A person, who depends on
perishable persons and objects etc., and who, wants to derives
pleasure, out of them by having affinity for them, can never be _
happy—this is a rule.

Appendix—In the mind first “sphurana’ an idea (a thought |
which flashes on the mind) flashes. If a thought is accompanied -
with the feeling of reality for it, attachment to it and insistence
on it, it is linked to us and it is transformed into a Sankalpa. _

| This Sankalpa gives birth to contemplation which in its turn
gives an impetus to evil propensities such as desire and anger
etc., (Gita 2/62-63). The topmost priority of a striver should be
not to let the impetus (impulse) be born viz., he should not allow
it to develop into a Sankalpa. Secondly if the impetus however
is born, he should not act according to it. :

Link:—Having described the sad plight of a person, who is
swayed by desire and anger, the Lord, in the next verse, explains
the glory of a person, who is happy within himself.

yo'ntahsukho'ntararamastathantarjyotireva yah

sa yogi brahmanirvanam brahmabhito'dhigacchati

One who is happy in God, rejoices in God and is illumined
in God, that Yogi (Sankhyayog!) identified with Brahma, attains
to the beatitude of God (Brahma nirvana). 24
Comment:—

'Yo'ntahsukho'ntararamastathantarjyotireva yah'—'Antah
sukhah’ (one who is happy within himself), is he, who instead
of being happy in possessing the worldly objects, is happy
only in God. Besides God, none is his object of happiness. He
constantly enjoys God.

He, constantly remains happy within himself and so he needs
no outward (external) objects etc. He remains happy within himself,
because the self cannot inflict pain upon the self, and the self, -
cannot have disinclination, for the self.

The outwardly or external objects etc., cannot be acquired,
by everyone forever, while the internal self can be attained by 7
everyone forever. |

'Antararamah'—(One who rejoices within himself), is he who :
instead of rejoicing in external pleasure, rejoices in the self or in
God, during spiritual practice, as well as in practical life.

The Lord, is. the illuminator and base of all the mundane
knowledge of senses and intellect etc., ‘antarjyotih' is a striver
who ever remains illumined.

Mundane knowledge, has a beginning and an end, while 7
the knowledge of God constantly, remains the same without
undergoing any change at all. A Sankhyayog!, naturally possesses
knowledge, that only God pervades everywhere.

‘Sa yogi brahmanirvanam brahmabhito'dhigacchati'—A
striver, following the path of Sankhya (knowledge), realizes
that he is established in Brahma (God), which shows his
egoistic thinking as he believes 'I am liberated’, 'I am established
"
707,"670 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA - [Chapter 5
in Brahma (God).’ So long as this egoistic notion prevails,
| it means, that he is not a God-realized soul i.e., he has: not
attained perfection. So, such a striver should not be satisfied, -
with this state.
The expression 'Brahmanirvanam’, means the attainment of
' Eternal Peace, without the least disquietude. |
_ When a Sankhyayogi, identifies himself with God, only God
remains, he does not retain his separate entity, in the least, he
attains perfection, or God-realization. In ""Brahma bhuta’ state, a
Striver realizes that he 1s identified with Brahma. But, when his
egoistic notion (individuality) perishes, none remains to realize
this identification. He himself becoming Brahma (God), attains
to Brahma (God).
| Appendix—-Here the term ‘antah’ should mean God rather -
than ‘antah karana’ (internal organ). The reason is that he who is
happy within the internal organ, who rejoices within the internal
_ organ and who is tranquilly illumined within the internal organ, 7
can’t attain Brahma (God). Brahma is attained having renounced
affinity for the internal organ. ~

"
708,"Verse 25] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 671
Comment:— a |
_ ""Yatatmanah'—The strivers, whose aim is God-realization,
have not to control their minds, bodies, senses and intellects, .
but they are instinctively and easily controlled. When, they are
controlled, strivers become free from evils, such as attachment and
aversion, and all their activities are for the welfare of others.
So long as, a striver. regards the body, senses, mind and
intellect as his, and for him, these are not controlled by him; and
they have such evils as attachment, aversion, desire and anger
etc. So a striver is controlled by them. Therefore, a striver should
not regard these as his, and for him. By doing so, they come
under his control. Here the expression 'Yatatmanah', has been
used, for those cautious and alert strivers, who do not regard
the body, senses, mind and intellect as theirs, and who consider
these as different from the self. | | -
_ ‘Sarvabhitahite ratah'—Egoistic ideas are the main stumbling
block for a striver following Sankhyayoga, in the way of God- -
realization. By effacing egoism, in order to realize the automatic .
identity with God, it is necessary to have sentiments.of the welfare, .
of all beings. Those, who rejoice in the welfare of all beings,
can easily wipe out their egoistic thoughts.
He, who wants to identify himself with the all-pervading |
Lord, must remain careful about the welfare of all beings. As a
| person, is careful about the welfare of all the parts of his body,
which have different shapes, names and functions, so does a
striver, think and work for the welfare of all beings, without
any distinction of caste, creed, colour, order of life and spiritual
. practice etc. He beholds the Lord, pervading every being, equally.
Therefore, when a person gets engrossed in the welfare of all
beings, his selfishness easily comes to an end, and he realizes
his identity with God.
‘Chinnadvaidha'—So long as, a striver does not have a firm
resolve to realize God, he has duality, in his mind. But when
"
709,"672 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 5
he has a firm resolve, his doubt or duality disappears, and he
is promptly engaged in spiritual practice.

'Ksinakalmasah'—Affinity for nature (prakrti) is the root, -
of all sins and evils. When a striver realizes, that he (the self)
is different from nature and its evolutes, such as body, senses,
mind and intellect etc., he accordingly becomes free from all
sins and evils.

'Rsayah'—The term 'Rs', means knowledge. He who attaches
importance to knowledge (discrimination), is a 'Rsi' (sage or
holy man). In the olden days, sages attained God-realization,
by leading a householder's life. In this verse also, there is a
description of those strivers, who practise spiritual discipline
with discrimination, in order to realize God while performing
mundane duties. Therefore, strivers who attach importance to -
their discrimination, are also sages (holy men).

'‘Labhante brahmanirvanam'—In fact, Brahma (God) is
attainable by all human beings. But having identified himself -
with the kaleidoscopic body etc., a person has a disinclination
for God. When his affinity for the perishable objects, such as the -
body etc., is renounced, all sins, evils and doubts are destroyed,
and he attains Brahma (God), Who pervades everywhere.

The Lord, explains by the word 'Labhante' (attains), that a
Sankhyayogi merges in Brahma (God), in the same way as waves
merge in sea. As waves, are not different from the sea, as both
of them are one and the same, in the same way, the soul and
the supreme soul, are one and the same.

Appendix—From the view-point of the people a Jnanayog! is
seen to be devoted to the welfare of others (sarvabhutahite ratah)
but in fact he does not do good to others but good (welfare) to
others 1s naturally done by him.

"
710,"Verse 26] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 673

the excellence of such God-realized souls. -

To those wise, who are freed from desire and anger, who have
subdued their minds and who have realized the self for them the
beatitude of God (Brahmic bliss) pervades on all sides. 26
Comment:— |
'Kamakrodhaviyuktanam yatinam'—The Lord declares,
that in the God-realized souls, there remains no trace of evil -
propensities, such as desire and anger etc. Those evil propensities
are born, when man has affinity for the unreal perishable objects
(body, senses, mind and intellect etc.). But when he realizes his -
identity with God, he has no attraction at all for the entire world,
including his body and mind etc. So, there is no question of the -
birth of evils, such as desire and anger, in him. If a striver has
desire and anger even in subtle forms, he should not consider
himself, a liberated soul.
Desire for perishable objects, is 'Kama'. A man, has a desire
only when he lacks something. In‘ Asat (unreal) always there
is deficiency or lacking, while the real self is not wanting in
anything. But, when he (the self) identifies himself with the
unreal, he feels something lacking in him. This want, gives
birth to desire. If desire is not satisfied, anger is born. Thus,
there is no desire in the self, but when It identifies Itself with
the unreal, It seems to have a desire. So how can those, who
have no identity with the unreal and who have realized the self,
experience privation?
Strivers, feel that they are not swayed so much by desire
"
711,"674 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
and anger now, because of their spiritual practice as they were
influenced in the past, without spiritual practice. It shows, that
these feelings have lessened through spiritual practice. It means, _
that they can be wiped out also, by spiritual practices.
Strivers realize (1) desire and anger are not so frequent as
they were in the past, (1) they are not so strong as they were,
in the past, (111) their duration is not so long as, it was in the
past. But, sometimes a striver feels otherwise i.e., he feels that
they are more forceful now, than they were in the past. The
reasons for that are (i) through spiritual practice, attachment for
pleasures is perishing, but perfection is not attained, (ii) because
of the purity of heart and mind, a little desire or anger, seems
too much to a striver, (iii) a striver, feels bad, if anything goes
against his wish but he does not care about it. But this feeling
accumulates. At last, the accumulated feelings blow up, even at i
the slightest provocation. Other people, are also surprised why |
he lost his temper, so easily. _
Sometimes, a striver judges himself by his inclinations, and
holds that he has attained perfection. But, in fact so long as, -
he realizes that he has attained perfection, it means that still
he has some trace of egoism left (individuality) and he has not
attained perfection.
""Yatacetasam'—The mind, is not subdued, so long as, a man
is attached to the unreal. But when great souls renounce this
attachment to the unreal, their minds are subdued.
'Abhito brahmanirvanam vartate viditatmanam'—Those great
souls, who have realized the self, which is the aim of human
life, are called 'Viditatmanam’.
Such great souls, here as well as hereafter, remain established,
in Brahma (God), the abode of eternal peace. As a common
man, while performing different activities, remains established in
his body constantly, so does a great soul remain established in
Brahma constantly, while undertaking different activities, because

he has nothing to do with that non-Self (Asat). :

Comment:— .
'‘SparSankrtva bahirbahyan'—All objects, except God are

external. ‘Shutting out external object’ means, that external

objects should not be thought of. .
The affinity for the external objects, is renounced in the

path of Action, through service, while in the path of knowledge

through discrimination. Here, the Lord declares that this affinity

can be renounced, through meditation. In meditation, when a

striver meditates only on God, he has a disinclination for external
* The path of meditation is an independent means for a striver to realize God

and it can also be used by the strivers following the paths of Action, Knowledge

and Devotion. Chanting the Lord's names, meditation, good company and study

of the scriptures are useful and necessary for every striver. -
"
713,"676 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
objects. It is not the external objects, but his assumed affinity
(attachment) for them, which is an obstacle to God-realization.
'CaksuScaivantare bhruvoh'—Here the expression 'Bhmvoh
antare’, may stand for, fixing vision between the eyebrows as -
well as, for fixing it at the tip of the nose (Gita 6/13).
During meditation, if the eyes are completely shut, a striver
may feel sleepy and if these are completely open, the scene and
objects which are before his eyes, may draw his attention and
create an obstacle. In order to, remove these distractions, it has
been said that with half-closed eyes, the gaze should be fixed,
between one's eyebrows. |
""Pranapanau samau krtva nasabhyantaracarinau'—The breath
exhaled, is 'prana’ while the breath inhaled is 'apana’. The speed
of ‘prana breath’ is fast, while the speed of ‘Apana breath’ is slow. -
In order to, regulate the process of exhalation and inhalation, so
that both of these may take equal time, first, the apana breath
is inhaled, through the left nostril, and then the prana breath is -
exhaled, through the right nostril. Then, the apana breath is inhaled
through the nght nostril and the prana breath is exhaled, through _
the left nostril. This process of exhalation and inhalation, should
take equal time. Through constant practice the flow of the prana
and the apana breath, becomes even, gentle and subtle (thin).
When, there is no sensation of air inside or outside the nostril
and in the throat etc., it should be understood, that the flow of
the prana breath and apana breath, has become even. When this
flow bcomes even, (because of the aim of God-realization), the
mind starts meditating on God. This control of the breathing
process, has been described here, because it plays an important
role, in the path of meditation.
'Yatendriyamanobuddhih'—There are two _ sources of
knowledge—senses and intellect. In between the two, the mind
has its place. A man, is to be cautious, whether his mind is
under the influence of senses or intellect or both senses and
"
714,"Verse 27-28] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 677 |
intellect. Senses, tempt the mind towards sense-objects, while
intellect guides it to think of the consequences. Those people,
whose minds are swayed by senses, indulge in worldly sensual
pleasures, while those, whose minds are guided by intellect, do -
not rejoice in pleasures born of contact (Gita 5/22).

Generally, strivers' minds are controlled, both by senses
and intellect. A sort of struggle goes on, in their minds. They,
neither attach full importance to their discrimination, nor do they
enjoy, worldly pleasures. This dualism (struggle) is an obstacle
to meditation. Therefore, the Lord means to say, that the mind
should be controlled by intellect (discrimination), rather than
by senses.

'Munirmoksaparayanah'—A striver, whose aim is God-
realization, has been called here, 'Moksaparayanah’. As the Lord,
pervades everywhere all the time, He is attainable to all. But He -
is not quickly attained, by people, because they have not a firm
resolve. As soon as they have a firm resolve, He will be realized. -
In fact, the aim (resolve) is pre-determined, because this human
body has been bestowed upon human beings, so that they may
attain God. But, they forget this aim. So they have to realize -
this aim. When they realize this aim, they will have a desire for |
God-realization. This desire, wipes out all the worldly desires
and leads strivers, to God-realization. The Lord, has used this
expression 'Moksaparayanah’, so that a striver may realize, that
his aim is God-realization. :

In all the spiritual disciplines—of Action, of Meditation, of
Devotion and of Knowledge etc., a firm resolve, (aim) plays a
very important role. How can a striver attain perfection or God-
realization, if he has not a firm resolve (aim) to attain Him? So
emphasis has been laid here on a firm resolve by the expression,
'Moksaparayanah’, in the path of meditation.

""'Vigatecchabhayakrodho yah'—We are angry with a man,
who is a stumbling block to the satisfaction of our desires, if
"
715,"678 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
he is weaker than us. But we are afraid, if he is stronger than
us. Similarly, we are afraid of death, if we have a desire to live
and are angry with those, who do not let us fulfil our desires.
Therefore, desire is the root of fear and anger. If a man has only |
the aim of God-realization, he can be free from fear, anger and
desires. As soon as, he is free from desires, he attains liberation
(salvation), as it is the desire to acquire objects and to be alive,
which leads him, to the bondage of birth and. death. A striver
should think seriously, whether he can acquire objects and be
alive, by escaping death merely by having desires. If it is not so,
he should have a firm resolve that he has to realize God only.
By doing so, he can be immediately liberated. But, if he has a
desire to acquire objects and to live, the desire will never be
fulfilled and he cannot be free, from the fear of death as also
from anger. Therefore, it is necessary to be desireless, in. order -
| to be liberated. | |

Things are not acquired by mere desires. To get a thing or -

- not to get a thing, does not depend upon mere desire, but it is
God's dispensation. Then, what is the difficulty in discarding
desires when they cannot procure us objects? No one, can -
escape death and acquire things by desiring. But if desires are
renounced, life can be blissful. If a person has no desire to live,
even death will provide him joy. Life becomes sad, when he has
desires and these are not satisfied; and death appears horrifying,
when he has a desire to live. Therefore, he who has renounced
the desire to acquire things, as well as to live is liberated, even
during this life and he becomes immortal.

'Sad4 mukta eva sah'—The assumption of affinity for the
perishable objects, is bondage while renunciation of this assumed
affinity, is liberation. He, who is liberated is not at all influenced,
by any incident, circumstance, praise, blame, favour, disfavour,
life and death etc. |

The expression 'Sada mukta eva’, shows that in fact, a striver
"
716,"Verse 29] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 679
(the self) is ever liberated, but he cannot realize the reality,
because of his assumed affinity (attachment) for the perishable
world. As soon as, this assumed affinity is renounced, he realizes -
his natural state of liberation or salvation. :
Appendix— ‘Shutting out external objects’ means to detach the
self from the body “I am not the body; the body is not mine and
the body is not for me.” Every striver will have to accept these
three facts whichever spiritual discipline he may follow. If we
don’t accept our affinity for the body, salvation is axiomatic.
In the twenty-fourth verse the term ‘antah’ was used, therefore
here the term ‘bahya’ (external) has been used. In fact there is
nothing external but it is merely an inclination. The term ‘bahya’
is used when we assume that there is another entity but in fact
there is only one entity. Therefore the expression ‘sparsankrtva a
bahirbahyan’ means there should not be the assumption at all
of any other existence besides the Divinity.

Comment:— -
'Bhoktaram yajiiatapasim'—When a person, performs any
good action, he regards the body, senses, mind, intellect and
"
717,"680 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
objects etc., with which he performs actions, as his own; and he
regards the person, for whom good action is performed, as the
enjoyer. If he worships a god, he considers, the god as enjoyer,
and if one renders service to a hungry man by offering him _—
food, he considers that hungry man, as the enjoyer of food. In
order to dispel this misunderstanding, the Lord declares that only
God is the enjoyer of all good actions, because He is seated in
the hearts of all.* Therefore, the Lord should be considered the
enjoyer of all virtuous actions, such as adoration and offering
food and water etc., to anyone. A striver, should aim at the Lord,
rather than at beings. a oO

In the twenty-fourth verse of the ninth chapter, also the Lord
declares, ""I alone am the enjoyer of all sacrifices (yajiias).”

Secondly, the body, senses, mind, intellect and objects etc., -
with which virtuous actions are performed, are not a person's
own, these belong to God. By an error, he regards them as his
own; and by regarding them as his own, and performing actions —
for himself with them, he becomes an enjoyer of those actions.
Therefore, the Lord exhorts him, to perform all actions only for -
Him. By doing so, those actions will not bear fruit for him, and
his affinity for actions will be renounced. |

It is desire, which influences a man to perform evil actions.
When he, having renounced desire, performs all actions only for
God, he cannot perform evil actions; and his affinity for virtuous
actions, is also renounced, by performing actions only for Him.
Thus, having renounced affinity for all actions totally, he attains
the Supreme Peace. Oo oo

'SarvalokamaheSvaram'—There may tk different lords, in
different worlds, but all of them are governed by God. So He
is the Supreme Lord of the lords, of all the worlds. It means
that only God is the Lord of the entire creation. So, how can an

* ""He is seated in the hearts of all"" (Gita 13/17); ""I am seated in the hearts of
all"" (Gita 15/15); ""The Lord abides in the hearts of all beings"" (Gita 18/61).
"
718,"Verse 29] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 681
honest man regard anything of the world, as his own?
- Generally, people regard, the bodies, senses, minds, intellects,
life-breaths, families, riches and property etc., as their own,
but they say that God is the Lord of the entire universe. Now -
the question arises, whether it is wise to say so. No, when
people regard, themselves as an owner of every person and
object etc., what remains there is whose lord He is? Therefore,
only he who regards nothing as his, can call, God as the Lord
of the entire universe. |
A man is free to make the right use of objects, such as body
etc., but he is not free to regard these as his own. If he, instead
of regarding these as his own, offers them to God, by regarding
them as His, he attains Supreme Peace. |
‘Suhrdam sarvabhitanam jiiatva mam santimrcchati'—Those,
who know* that God, Who is the Lord of the lords of all the -
worlds, is a disinterested friend of all beings; and no one else
does them so much good as He, and no one preserves them and -
loves them so much as He, they attain Supreme Peace. Why
should we be full of fear, worry, disturbance and disquietude
etc., when the omnipotent Lord is the disinterested friend, of -
all of us?
Only God and his devotees, are interested in the welfare of
living creatures, in a selfless manner. There is nothing unattained
that should be attained (Gita 3/22) by. Him; therefore, He is
naturally a disinterested friend of all. A devotee, also thinks of
the welfare of all beings and does good to them (Srimadbhagavata
3/25/21). The disinterested nature of devotees, has descended
upon them, only from God. |
God is the Enjoyer of all sacrifice and austerities. He is the
great Lord of all the worlds, and He is the most disinterested
friend, of all beings. Out of these three facts if strivers accept just

If they accept all the three, God, is realized instantaneously.

'Desire’, 'a sense of mine for worldly objects’ and ‘disinclination -
for God’, are the three stumbling blocks to God-realization. The
Lord, by the expression 'Bhoktararh yajiiatapasam', means to say,
that a striver should have no desire and should do nothing for
himself. By the expression 'Sarvalokamahesvaram' He means to
say, that he should regard nothing as his i.e., he should renounce
the desire for pleasure, and should not lay claim to objects and
persons. By the expression 'Suhrdam sarvabhutanam’, He says
that he should regard only God as his. If he accepts one of these
facts the remaining two are automatically translated into practice
by him, and he realizes God. -

A man, can renounce desire for pleasure, only if he does not |
regard any being or object as his. If he has a sense of possession
over them, he will expect some reward or the other, from them.
When a striver renounces the desire for pleasure, his sense of = __
mine, is renounced; and if he renounces the sense of mine, his
desire for pleasure is renounced. When he renounces his senses -
of mine for all objects and persons, only God remains his, and
he realizes his real affinity, for Him. As soon as, the desire for
pleasures is renounced, or the sense of ‘mine’ is renounced, or
the striver realizes his real affinity for God, he attains Supreme
Peace, because if he translates anyone of these into practice, the
remaining two, are automatically translated into practice.

A man, should perform action and also know the art of
their performance. He cannot perform actions properly and
scrupulously, without either of the two. Therefore, in the third
chapter, the Lord has laid special emphasis on the performance
of actions, but has also said, that a striver should know what
action is; in the fourth chapter He has laid special emphasis on
the knowledge of the true nature of action, and also mentioned
the necessity of performing action. In the fifth chapter, the Lord
"
720,"Verse 29] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI | 683
has described both the paths of Knowledge (Sankhyayoga) and
of Action (Karmayoga), as means of God-realization, yet He
has declared, that the path of Action is superior, to that of
Knowledge. In this chapter, the Lord having systematically
described the paths of Action and Knowledge, in answer to
Arjuna's question has dealt with the path of meditation, in brief
and of his own accord described the path of Devotion, in the
last thereby expressing his aim that every striver should follow
this path which is the best of all.

Sixth Chapter
INTRODUCTION -

In the beginning of the fifth chapter, Arjuna asked Lord |
Krsna, which of the two, the Discipline of Knowledge or the
Discipline of Disinterested Action, is better. Lord Krsna replied,
""Both of them lead to supreme bliss, but Yoga of action is
superior to the Yoga of knowledge (5/2).""
- Lord Krsna described, upto the twenty-sixth verse of the fifth
chapter, how these lead to supreme bliss. Then, He described
in brief the Discipline of Meditation, in two verses, which is
helpful in the Discipline of Knowledge as well as Action and it
leads to supreme bliss, independently. Then, He concluded the
fifth chapter, by explaining the glory of devotion towards Him _
out of His own wiil.

Lord Krsna in the sixth chapter further explains, the superiority
of the Discipline of Disinterested Action. -

anasritah karmaphalam karyam karma karoti yah
Sa sannyasil ca yogi ca na niragnirna cakriyah
The Blessed Lord said: |

He who undertakes action without desiring its fruit, is both
a Sannyasi (Sankhyayogi) and a Yogi (Karmayogi). He is not a
Sannyasi (renouncer), one who has merely renounced the sacred
fire (ritual) and is not a Karmayogi, who has merely stopped all
actions. (1)
Comment:—

‘Anasritah karmaphalam'—Lord Krsna, appears to say, that a
"
723,"686 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 6
man should not depend on men, things, incidents, circumstances
and actions etc., because they are all perishable and kaleidoscopic,
and he himself, being a fragment of God, is imperishable and
constant. So, how can the perishable, satisfy the imperishable? -
Man thus feels a void. Moreover, he gets attached to them :
and that attachment is the cause of his birth in good and evil
bodies (Gita. 13/21). If he-renounces this attachment, he may
realize emancipation which is axiomatic. In fact, he is naturally
emancipated. But, it 1s because of attachment that he cannot
realize this emancipation. Therefore the Lord declares, that a
person should discharge his duty for duty's sake, without having
any attachment to the fruit of action. Abandoning the fmit of
action, a Yogi attains peace in the form of God-realization;
whereas, he who works with a selfish motive, being attached
to the fruit of action, is bound (Gita 5/12). -
A man, without depending on anyone of the three
bodies—physical, subtle and causal, which are the fruits of
actions, should use them in the welfare of all beings. He should, -
render selfless service to others, with the physical body, think
of the welfare and salvation of others with the subtle-body, and -
offer stability (trance) acquired through the causal body, for the |
welfare of the world. These bodies belong to the world, not to
us and so, they are for the service of the world, not for us. They
have their identity with the world, while they are distinct from
the self. Not to depend on these bodies means, ‘not to expect
the fruit of action’, and to work for the welfare of the world
means, ‘to discharge one's duty’. One who, discharges one's
duty for duty's sake, without expecting its fruit viz., serves the
world, with worldly things. Being a Karmayogi, is extolled as
a Sannyasi in this verse, and one who renounces mineness from
the worldly things, is a Tyagi.i.e., Yogt.
The result, of discharging duty without expecting its fruit,
will be that he will not develop new attachment, as he does not
"
724,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI | 687
perform actions for himself; and old attachment will perish, by
doing good to others. By performing actions, his impulse for
actions will also disappear. Thus renunciation of attachment, _
will spontaneously lead to salvation. The desire, to get hold
of the perishable is bondage, and to renounce this desire is,
emancipation. The method to attain emancipation, is that one
should not depend on the perishable viz., should not have any
affinity for it. | |
'Karyam karma karoti yah'—'Karyam’' and ‘duty’ are
synonyms. What can be easily performed, is a must, and what
can never and be forsaken, is called a duty. Discharge of duty
is not impossible, not even hard. What ought not to be done, is
not duty, it is 'Akartavya’ (that should not be done). Activities,
which ought not to be done are of two types. (1) Those that are _
beyond our capacity. (2) Those which are forbidden by scriptures
and traditions. Such activities, are never to be done. The gist
is, that we should resort to prescribed duties without expecting -
any return, with a detached spirit, for the welfare of others. One
should, discharge one's duty, in accordance with the ordinance _
of scriptures, for the welfare of others and without expecting its
fruit, in order to do away with attachment for action, as well |
as its fruit. | .
Actions, are performed, with two attitudes of mind—for
obtaining worldly things and for wiping out attachment for
actions and their fruits. The inspiration to perform actions, with
the latter attitude, is given here. :
'Sa sannyasi ca yogi ca'—He who, discharges his duty in
the above mentioned way, is a Sannydsi and a Yogi. He is a
Sannyasi, because he discharges his duty without attachment for
action and its fruit and is a Yogi, because he remains equanimous
in pleasure and pain, while discharging his duty.
His sense, of doership and enjoyership, is destroyed by doing
actions without expecting any reward. Thus all his links with
"
725,"688 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
actions, and the fruits are, totally cut asunder. Therefore, that
Karmayogi has been called a ‘Sannyasi.'
_ Arjuna thought it better to renounce the physical performance -

of actions and thus be a Sannyasi. So, in 2/5, Arjuna said, that it
was better to live on alms, than to wage war. So Lord Krsna, says
to Arjuna, ""O Arjuna, the conception you have about a Sannyasi
is not right. He, who discharges his duty for duty's sake, without
being attached to the fruit of action, is a real Sannyasi.""

""Na niragnih'—By forgoing household fire viz., 'Havana' and
sense-objects etc., a person, is not a Sannyasi in the real sense.
Till he has. importance and attraction for material objects, he
cannot be a real Sannyasi. : |

""Na akriyah'—Generally, people think that a Yogi, is he
who abandons all things and actions, and leads a secluded _
life in a state of trance. But, Lord Krsna wants to say, that a
Yogi, is he who discharges his duty, by ceasing to depend on
the perishable viz., without expecting any fruit from action. A -
secluded life, with senses under control, may inspire man to attain
some accomplishments (Siddhi), but it cannot lead him to God- _
realization. By merely discarding actions physically, he cannot be
called, a Karmayogi. A Yogi, in the real sense, is he who performs
his duty and having no dependence at all, on perishable objects.

A man, has an instinct for action. So sometimes, it is
observed that good strivers who attempted to devote themselves
to adoration and meditation in solitude, had to engage themselves
in performing actions, for the welfare of others, by giving up
their secluded life. The momentum of the impulse for action, is
pacified, only when actions are performed selflessly solely for

| the welfare of others. In that case, equanimity is attained and

that equanimity leads to God-realization. |

The feelings, of egoism (I'ness) and attachment or Mineness,
"
726,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 689
are man-made. First, a man accepts that he is a householder, but
when he becomes a Sadhu, he says that he is a Sadhu. Thus his _ |
egoism changes. Similarly, he has attachment for a thing which :
he possesses. But, when he gives it to someone, permanently, he
has no attachment left for it. It proves, that feelings of egoism
and attachment, are not real but are only assumed. Had they been
real, these might not have ceased to be, because 'The real, never
ceases to be' and if it ceases to be, it means that it is not real,
but is unreal, as ""The unreal has no existence’ (Gita 2/16).
The Self (soul), which is the base of egoism and attachment,
is a fragment of God and is ever-existent and has identity with
God, Who pervades everywhere. In the self, there is neither
egoism nor attachment, but man by identifying himself with the a
body and the worldly things, accepts these as in him. Actually,
he is free and capable of identifying himself with them. But, it
is upto him, whether he accepts this identification or does not. -
It is not so, that he is not free or capable to breaking off, this
identification. It is, he himself who has accepted this affinity
with the body and the world, and not otherwise. Therefore, he
who can assume this connection, can also snap it. Every human
being, is free to accept that he is a householder or a Sadhu. —
Similarly he can accept things as his own or not his. He accepts,
that he is a baby, a boy, a youth and an old man at different
stages of life. Similarly, he accepts toys as his own in babyhood
or boyhood while in youth and old age he accepts money and
property etc., as his own. Thus, he can accept an affinity or
renounce it. This affinity, can be renounced easily, because it
is based on mere assumption.
The Self is eternal while the body and the world, are transient.
Therefore, affinity between the eternal and the transient cannot
be everlasting. When the self accepts this affinity, it seems that
egoism and attachment are part and parcel of the self and it is
difficult to renounce them. But it is wrong. This affinity is not
"
727,"690 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
real, it is only an assumed one. Because the self is the uwluminator
and the onlooker, while the body is an object to be illumined and
looked on; the Self is beyond space, while a body is confined -
to space. The self is sentient, while the body is insentient; the ,
self is the knower, while the body is to be known. The Self is
the knower, till relation with the body is there. In the absence of
this relation, the Self is Knowledge-incarnate. In that knowledge,
there is neither ‘I’, nor 'mine’. There is total negation of egoism
and mineness. Thus, they are poles apart. The self, actually is
none else, but the Absolute, Who neither has, nor had, nor will
have egoism and attachment, or mineness in the least. |
Appendix—The entire universe from an ant upto the abode
of Brahma, is the fruit of action. The world is formed of objects,
persons and actions. Everything is acquired and is-lost, there is ~- :
union and disunion of every person, and every action begins
and ends. The man, who having renounced dependence on the
three—things, persons and actions, discharges his duty, is a true :
Sannyasi and a Yogi. He who, without renouncing the desire.
for the fruit of action, renounces mere sacred fire, is not a true ~
sannyasi and he, who renounces performance of actions, is not
a true Yogi. The reason is that a man gets bound by desire for
the fruit of actions, not by fire or actions.
In the third verse of the third chapter the Lord mentioned
the two fold path—the path of knowledge and the path of action.
Then in the fourth and the fifth verses of the fifth chapter the
Lord mentioned that both Sankhyayoga and Karmayoga bear
the same fruit. Now the Lord with the same notion declares
that he who has renounced the desire for the fruit of action, is
a real Sankhyayogi and a real Karmayogi. It means that by mere
cessation of the functions of the mind a man does not become a
Yogi. He becomes a Yogi only when he renounces the desire for
the fruit of actions. The reason is that so long as the the desire
for the fruit of actions persists, by cessation of the functions
"
728,"Verse 2] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 691
of mind ‘Siddhis’ (occult powers or accomplishments) can be
achieved, but salvation can not be attained.

who is a Sannyasi is a Yogi. So, in the next verse, Lord Krsna
explains the relationship between Karma Sannyasa (Discipline
of Knowledge) and Karmayoga (Discipline of Action).

O Pandava, what they speak of as Sannydsa, know that to ~
be the same as Karma Yoga; for none becomes a Yogi without
renouncing thought of the world. 2
Comment:— a |

'Yam sannyasamiti prahuryogarn tara viddhi pandava'—In the
beginning of the fifth chapter, Lord Krsna explained, that the Yoga ;
of Knowledge and the Yoga of Action, both lead to Supreme
Bliss (5/2), and the supreme state, is attained equally by both
the means (5/5) viz., both of them are the same. Similarly, here
He points out, that as a Sannydsi is a renouncer, a Karmayog, :
is also a renouncer.

In the ninth verse of the eighteenth chapter also, Lord Krsna
says, ""An action which is performed as a duty, giving up attachment
and fruit, is regarded as ‘Sattvika’ form of renunciation."" By
this renunciation, a man becomes a renouncer, or a Yogi, as
he totally gets detached, from objects and actions. Similarly, a
Sannyasi renounces doership, and is thus a renouncer. It means,
that there is no difference between a Yogi and a Sannyasi viz.,
both are the same. Therefore, Lord Krsna, in the third verse of
the fifth chapter, said, ""The Karmayogi should ever be considered
"
729,"692 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
a Sannyasi (renouncer), for he has transcended the pairs of
opposites, such as attachment and aversion.""

""Na hyasannyastasankalpo yogi bhavati kaScana'—Different -
thoughts come into the mind. The thought for which there is
attachment or aversion of the mind, becomes a 'sankalpa' (pursuit of
the mind). Without renouncing that pursuit, no one can become a
Yogi (Sankhyayogi or Karmayog!), but he is a voluptuary, because
union (affinity) for God is Yoga’, and one who has a desire for
pleasure, is a voluptuary, not a ""Yog?’, because instead of attachment
for God, he is attached to pleasure. But, when he renounces, the

_ desire for the unreal, he becomes a renouncer and realizes his
eternal union, with God. As men are sensual, so are birds and
animals, because they have also, not renounced pursuits of the mind.

It means, that so long as there is the least affinity for the Se
unreal, a man cannot become a ""Yogr’, in spite of a lot of practice,
trance and a secluded life, according to the gospel of the Gita.

Though the process of Discipline of Sannyasa, and that of 7
Yoga, are different, yet as far as renunciation of the pursuits of
the mind is concerned, both are, one and the same. -

aruruksormuneryogam karma  k4ranamucyate

yogariidhasya tasyaiva Samah karanamucyate

To the contemplative soul (muni) who desires to attain to the
height of Karmayoga (in the form of equanimity), action without
motive, is said to be the means. For the same person when he
masters Yoga, serenity (tranquillity of mind) is said to be the
means, to God-realization. 3
"
730,"Verse 3] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 693
Comment:—
‘Aruruksormuneryogam karma kdranamucyate'—He, who
desires to rise to the heights of Yoga (equanimity), action without :
motive, is spoken of as the means. Every human being, who .
is born, nourished and is living his life has been dependent on
others. Al] his possessions, body, senses, mind, intellect and ego
all are evolutes of nature. Therefore, till he through these does
not render service to others, he will not rise to the height of
Karmayoga, or in other words, he will not attain equanimity. It
means, that a man should discharge his duty, by rendering service
to others with all his means, because whatever means (including
his body, senses, mind, intellect and ego) he possesses, belong
to society; and all the things have identity with the world, not
with the self. By rendering service to others, the flow of actions, -
will be directed towards the world, and man himself will attain
equanimity. The same fact, has been explained, by Lord Krsna
(in Gita 4/23), ""He, who performs actions, for the welfare of -
others, his actions melt away viz., do not lead him to bondage.""
And, in Gita 3/9 He declares, ""Man is bound by actions, other -
than those performed for the sake of sacrifice viz., he is bound,
when he performs these with a selfish motive.""
How is action without motive, the means to rise to the heights
of Karmayoga (equanimity)? The answer is, that our equanimity
will be judged, only when we perform actions. While performing
actions if we aim to remain equanimous, in pleasure and pain,
it means that our action, is the means to rise to the height of
Yoga, otherwise not.
""Yogariidhasya tasyaiva Samah karanamucyate’'—Affinity for
the unreal, causes disquietude, because the Self is eternal and
permanent, while all the worldly objects such as bodies etc.,
are transient and kaleidoscopic. But when the Self accepts his
affinity with them and foresees their destruction or they actually
perish, he becomes disquiet. But, if he utilizes them in rendering
"
731,"694 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA _ [Chapter 6
service to others, his affinity breaks off, he rises to heights of
Yoga and attains, tranquillity. If he enjoys that. tranquillity, it
will delay his progress. But, if he does not get attached to it,
: and does not enjoy it, that tranquillity becomes the means of
his God-realization. |
Appendix—The striver who desires to attain to the height
of Karmayoga (equanimity), action without motive is said to be
the means; and the serenity thus attained, is-the: means to God-
realization. It means that an action is not the means to attain
God but serenity attained by renouncing affinity for actions, 1s
the reason. This serenity is a means rather than an end. ©
‘When actions are performed discriminately, attachment
(impetus) to actions is wiped out, because actions have no power
to wipe out attachment but through discrimination it is possible. = -
He, who desires to attain to the height of Karmayoga, performs
_ all actions discriminately. When discrimination develops, then
/ a striver realizes helplessness in the fulfilment of his desire —
and feels a lack (shortage) in its unfulfilment. No one wants
dependence and shortage but a man does not get rid of these :
_two by having a desire. '
Having attained to the height of Karmayoga, a striver should
not be pleased because this pleasure will arrest his progress
and so God-realization will be delayed (Gita 14/6). As a boy
takes interest in games and sports, but when he grows up, he
starts taking interest in earning money, then his taste for play
is naturally wiped out. Similarly until God is realized, a striver
relishes serenity. But if he does not relish that serenity and
becomes indifferent to it, his relish is naturally wiped out and
very soon he realizes God. - |
To attain to the height of yoga, action is the means viz.,
while performing actions for the welfare of others without any
selfish motive, a striver gets detached from all actions etc., then
he attains to the height of yoga. Actions come to an end but
"
732,"Verse 4] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 695
yoga (equanimity) ever persists. |

A Karmi (Bhogi) performs actions and a Karmayogi also
performs actions but there is a vast difference in their aims. The -
former performs actions to satisfy his desire, while the latter :
performs actions in order to renounce attachment. A ‘Bhogi’
(pleasure-seeker) works for himself while a Karmayogi works
for others. Therefore though both are equal as far as performance
of actions with attachment is concerned, yet the striver who
works for others in order to renounce attachment, attains to the
height of yoga. A yogi’s equanimity will be judged only when
he performs actions without attachment ‘vrddha nari pativrata’

(an old woman is chaste).

What has been called ‘Sama’ (serenity)) here, the same has |
been called ‘prasada’ (placidity or purity of mind) (Gita 2/64). If a -
striver does not take delight in this serenity, he attains everlasting
peace (Supreme Bliss) (Gita 6/15). Renunciation of the fruit of
action leads to supreme peace (Gita 12/12). If a striver does not :
take delight in peace (serenity), he attains uninterrupted relish
(Self-realization) and if he is not satisfied with ‘akhanda rasa’ -
(unbroken relish), he attains infinite Bliss (supreme love). |

yada hi nendriyarthesu na karmasvanusajjate

sarvasankalpasannyasi yogaridhastadocyate

When a man ceases to have any attachment, either for the
objects of senses or for actions (Karma) and has renounced all
thoughts of the world, he is said to have attained Yoga and is |
called Yogariidha. 4
"
733,"696 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
Comment:— .

""Yada hi nendriyarthesu na karmasvanusajjate'—Firstly, a
striver should not be attached to objects of five senses—sound,
touch, colour, taste, smell; to favourable circumstances, incidents, _
men, comfort, respect and praise etc. He should not enjoy them,
and should not be pleased with them. He should remain detached,
by thinking that all of these are transient and perishable.

The means to get detached from the objects of senses, is not
to derive pleasure out of fulfilment of desires. One should not
be pleased with desirable objects, circumstances, incidents and
persons etc. If he derives pleasure out of sense-objects, these
enhance attachment. Therefore, a striver should, neither desire
favourable circumstances, nor derive pleasure out of them. In ~

_ this way, his’senses will not get attached, to sense-objects. _

Secondly, a man feels absence of favourable objects etc.,

_ without acquiring these and having acquired them, he becomes
: a slave to them. Actually, he is a slave in both the cases. First, _
he was a slave because he wanted to acquire them, and then he
became a slave, lest they should slip away. But in the second -
case, he does not realize his servility. He rather feels, that with
their acquisition he is free. This is mere deception. Similarly,
deriving pleasure out of favourable circumstances, is a deception,
as such pleasure, spoils his nature and gives birth to desire,
to enjoy pleasure, again and again. This desire for pleasure,
misleads him to the shackles of birth and death. To desire, and
to expect favourable circumstances, and then to feel happy on
their acquisition is the root of all miseries and sins. If this desire
is discarded, a man attains equanimity. _ )

: Thirdly, whatever extra money and objects, besides our
necessities, we possess are not ours, they are of the poor and the
needy. So, we should hand these over to the poor and the needy
people, and should think that by doing so, we are free from debt.
Thus, we shall not get attached, to objects and riches etc.
"
734,"Verse 4] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 697
'Na karmasvanusajjate'*—As a striver, should not be attached
to objects of sense, he should also not be attached, to actions and
their fruits. If action is performed well, it gives pleasure, but if -
it is not, it gives pain. This pleasure or pain, is attachment by
action. So a striver, should perform actions carefully and efficiently
without being attached to them, because they are transient, while
his self, is eternal. So how can they have any effect on him? He
is affected only, when he is attached to them, and that attachment
misleads him to the cycle of birth and death. So, he should not
be attached either to objects of senses or to actions. By doing —
so, he becomes completely detached from nature, which consists
of only actions and objects. Thus he attains Yoga.
Here a point needs attention that generally there is attachment
to actions for their fruits and the fruits are the pleasures. So, if ~
this attachment for pleasure perishes, attachment to actions will
also perish. Then, why has Lord Krsna mentioned cessation of ;
attachment to actions? The reason is, that there is an independent
attachment for actions also. Even without a desire for fruit,
there is a momentum of impulse for actions; so a man wants: -
to perform an action. A man, ceases to have that attachment
by performing actions, either for others or for God. So, Lord
Krsna, in the twelfth chapter, first exhorted Arjuna to seek to
attain Him, through Yoga (Discipline) of practice. But, if he
was unable to practice, Lord Krsna asked him, to be intent on
performing actions for Him (12/10). It means, that a striver who
cannot concentrate his mind, on God and if there is an inner urge
for actions, he should perform actions, only for God. Thus, the
attachment of a striver, who follows the Discipline of Devotion,
* Here the term 'Karmasu' has been used in the plural number which shows
that the man who is attached to actions has a desire to perform several actions
and reap their fruits. But in the forty-fifth verse of the eighteenth chapter the
term ‘Karmani' has been used in the singular number in order to show that a man
free from attachment performs several actions with one intellect that he has to
perform his duty.
"
735,"698 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
will be blotted out. Similar, will be the result, in case of a striver
who follows the Discipline of Action, if he performs actions,
for the welfare of others. oo -
- As there is, attachment for action, there is also attachment,
for inaction. A striver, should have no attachment for inaction
also, because inaction causes idleness and laziness, which are
""Tamasika' traits; while attachment to action, misleads to futile
- pursuits with ""Rajasika’ traits. |
How long will a striver take, to rise to the height of Yoga?
To answer this question, Lord Krsna has used the terms ""Yada’
~ and ""Tada' viz., ‘when' and ‘then’. It means, that as soon as, he
ceases to have any attachment for the objects of senses, and for
actions, he attainsYoga.

Man himself, being. a fragment of God, is eternal and - |
free but he gets attached to the perishable worldly bodies and
objects, the evolutes of nature and this attachment leads him to
bondage. If he has a firm determination, not to enjoy worldly —
objects and actions today, he will at once attain Yoga, because
Yoga (equanimity) is axiomatic. We do not realize it (the real), -
because we are attached tothe unreal. |

‘Sarvasankalpasannyasi'—Out of all 'sphuranas’; the 'sphurana’,
which is pleasing and to which we are attached, becomes a
‘sankalpa'. | Lo

This 'sankalpa' proves to be pleasant or unpleasant, because of
favourable or unfavourable circumstances. A man, has attachment
to favourable circumstances, while he has aversion for the
unfavourable ones. Thus, this 'sahkalpa’ being always harmful
leads to nothing but bondage. It is conducive, neither to Self-
realization, nor to selfless service or to devotion to God or for
good relations, with the family. Thus, a striver should renounce,
this 'Sankalpa’, by thinking that it involves neither one’s own
welfare nor of the world, it is conducive neither to the service of
the family nor to God-realization (Self-realization). So, a striver
"
736,"Verse 4] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 699 ,
should be free, from all 'sankalpas' (thoughts of the world).

If a striver, does not get attached to the thought, it is a
'sphurana’. If a 'sphurana’ does not assume the shape of a 'sankalpa’, -
it vanishes naturally. This 'sphurana’, should also be renounced,
because it wastes time though it does not cause much harm and a |
downfall. But a striver must renounce 'sankalpas', because without
renouncing them, he does not attain Yoga; and without attaining
Yoga he does not realize God. Something remains to be done by him
and his human life is not successful. He does not develop devotion
to God and he does not, become totally free from sufferings. _

In the second verse of this chapter, the Lord declares, by a
negative inference, that none becomes a Yogi without renouncing
thoughts of the world, while in this verse He declares more —
positively that a man attains Yoga, by renouncing thoughts of -
the world. It means, that a striver should have no thought of
the world in the least. : |

(i) God has bestowed this human birth, the last of all births -
upon us, by His grace for our salvation. So, we have not to waste
this valuable time of human life, in futile thought of the world.

By thinking so, the pursuit of mind, can be renounced.

(ii) A striver, following the Discipline of Action, has to :
discharge his duty, without attachment (Gita 3/19) at present, —
while the thoughts that come to his mind, are either of the past
or the future. So a striver, should not be entangled in them.

(iii) A striver, following the Discipline of Devotion, should
think that God is existent here and now, He is his and is in
him, while the thoughts that come to the mind, are either of the
past or the future. So, it is a blunder to think of the pursuits,
which do not exist now, but not to think of God, Who has His
existence now. By thinking so, a striver should renounce all
thoughts of the world.
"
737,"700 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6

""Yogariidhastadocyate'—Equanimity, in success and failure, is
called Yoga (Gita 2/48). Attainment of equanimity is attainment
of Yoga. Equanimity leads to God-realization. In the second verse
of this chapter, Lord Krsna declared, that none becomes a Yogi _
without renouncing the thoughts of the world, and here, He has
declared that by renouncing all thoughts of the world, a man is
said to have attained Yoga. It proves, that all the Disciplines as
that of Knowledge, or that of Action, lead to attainment of Yoga
(Gita 5/5) as both disciplines culminate in the renunciation of
all thoughts of the world.

Appendix—What is the mark of the yogi who has attained
to the height of Karmayoga? For this the Lord has mentioned
three factors—not to be attached to objects (things and persons),
not to get attached to actions; and to renounce ail thoughts
of the world viz., to renounce one’s own will. It means that
he should not be attached to sensual pleasures and actions
and should not insist from within that it should occur and it _
should not occur. He, who is neither attached to objects nor
to the lack of objects; is neither attached to actions nor to the _
lack of actions and who has no ‘Sankalpa’ (projection of the
mind), is said to attain to the height of Karmayoga. It means
that he should not insist on availability or non-availability of
objects, union or disunion of persons and performance or non-
performance of actions (Gita 3/18).

A striver should reflect upon whether there is anything which
will ever stay with us and with which we shall ever stay. Is
there any person who will ever live with us and with whom we
shall ever live? Is there any action which we shall ever go on
performing and which will ever be performed by us? Neither
a thing nor a person nor an action will ever stay with us. One
day we shall be devoid of a thing, a person and an action. If
we accept their disunion at present and get detached from them,
then freedom from the bondage of worldly life is axiomatic. It
"
738,"Verse 4] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 701
means that the union with things, persons and actions is transient
but their disunion is eternal. By accepting the eternal fact, the
eternal divinity 1s attained and no lack remains.
Detachment from sense-objects and actions means—freedom
from desire and from. the sense of doership. If a striver is not
attached to pleasures and objects, he becomes free from desires;
and if he is not attached to actions, he becomes free from the
sense of doership. Being free from desire and from the sense
of doership, he naturally gets established in the self. In fact he
does not get established but he is already established but he does
not realize it because of his desire and the sense of doership. If
there is absence of desire and the sense of doership, the striver
realizes his self-evident abode in the self.
As while writing, we use a pen and we put the pen in its BS
original position as soon as the writing is over, similarly a striver
should use the body, while working and put (leave) it in its -
original position as soon as the work is over viz., should get
detached from it; then after every action he will be established
in yoga (equanimity). If he is totally detached from actions, he .
will attain to the height of yoga. . :
Attachment to Kriya (pleasure) and objects (prosperity) leads
to ruin (downfall) (Gita 2/44), therefore a striver should neither
be attached to actions nor to the fruit of actions (Gita 2/47, 5/12).
He should not enjoy pleasure born of his resolve viz., he should
not derive pleasure from the fulfilment of his resolve. He should
not resolve even for his salvation because the resolve for salvation
strengthens (the existence of) bondage. Therefore renouncing all
worldly thoughts he should remain quite indifferent.

uddharedatmanatmanam natmanamavasada yet

- atmaiva hyatmano bandhuratmaiva ripuratmanah

Let a man emancipate himself by his own self; and not degrade
himself; for he himself is his friend as well as his enemy. 5
Comment:—

'Uddharedatmanatmanam'—A man should lift himself by his
own self. It means, that he should lift himself, above the body,
senses, mind, intellect and life-breath, because all of these belong _
to matter (nature) and have identity with matter, while his self,
is a fragment of God and has identity -with Him. It also means, -
that he should lift himself from the limited 'T’, to the unlimited :
‘Self. So, for God-realization, there is no need to depend, on
the insentient, the unreal, because attachment for the unreal, or _
dependence on the unreal, is the main obstacle to God-realization.
There is no need of the body, senses, mind and intellect, to attain
God Who is one's own. He, is in him, exists now and here,
because the real cannot be attained by the unreal, the real, can
be attained by renouncing connection with the unreal.

Secondly, as it was explained in the previous verse, a
man should cease to have any attachment for objects, actions
and thoughts, and raise himself above them. It is everyone's
experience, that objects, actions and thoughts, have a beginning
and an end. They are born and decay; are united and disunited,
but his self remains the same, without the least modification. |
Therefore; detachment from these means, lifting himself by his
own self.

Man possesses discrimination, by utilizing which, a striver
"
740,"Verse 5]. SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 703
can lift himself and can realize God. A striver, by following the
Discipline of Knowledge, can discriminate between the real and
the unreal, and thus get established in his own self. A striver, _
following the Discipline of Devotion, accepts that he is God's
and God is his, and this feeling leads him to God-realization. A
striver, following the Discipline of Action, by using discrimination,
utilizes the so-called body, senses, mind and intellect in rendering
service to others and thus by breaking off his affinity with them,
gets established, in his own self. Thus, his discrimination leads
him to God-realization, whatever discipline, he may follow.
Think of—T am not body’, because the body changes, while
J remain the same; ""This body is not mine’, because I cannot keep _
this body healthy, and in my possession, as long as I wish; ""This
body is not for me’, because if it had been for me, I might have -
not had any other desire. Secondly, this body is changeful, while :
I am eternal. How can this kaleidoscopic body, be of any use to
the eternal 'Self'? Thirdly, if it had been for me, it would have -
lived with me forever, but it does not live. Therefore, if a man
thinks seriously, and sticks to the thought, 'I am not body’, ""The
body is not mine’ and ""The body is not for me’, he will realize
God spontaneously.
Now, a question arises, why Lord Krsna has said, that a
man should lift himself by his own self, when God, preceptors,
saints and scriptures, also lead a man to God-realization. The
answer 1s, that all of them will lead us to God-realization, only
if we have faith in them; and it depends upon us, whether we
have faith or we do not. It is, because of the lack of faith and |
desire, that several incarnations of the Lord, and many saints and
liberated souls, could not enable us to realize God. But, those
who had faith in them, realized Him. Therefore, a striver by
having faith in them and by obeying them should realize God. It
"
741,"704 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6

is an unique opportunity for us, that this human body has been
bestowed upon us in this Kali-Age, so that we may realize God,

not only once, but several times during this life. But, we can -
realize Him, only when we ourselves want to do so. |

Secondly, man has degraded himself, as he has accepted his
affinity for the world, the world has not accepted that affinity, —
which breaks off, every moment. If one does not accept any
new affinity, he may realize God.

""Natmanamavasadayet'—He, should not degrade himself. It
means that he himself being uniform and sentient, should not
enslave himself, by having dependence on the transient and
insentient worldly objects, such as riches, ranks etc. By virtue
of his riches and ranks, he assumes himself to be elevated. This
elevation, is of his virtues rather than his own. This dependence —
amounts to his degradation. But, how shocking and surprising it
is, that he regards this degradation as promotion, and dependence ”
as independence! |

‘Atmaiva hyatmano bandhuh'—A man, himself is his friend,
when he accepts that there is no need for mundane things, such -
as body, senses, mind, intellect etc:, in God-realization. Secondly,
he should have faith in his guide, in God, saints and scriptures.

They will lead him to God-realization. By having this faith, he
himself is his friend.

‘Atmaiva ripuratmanah'—He himself, is his enemy, when
he accepts his affinity with the worldly body, senses and
mind etc. : |

In the second line of the verse, the term ‘Eva’ (only), has
been used twice, to emphasize the fact, that he and only he
himself, is his friend and foe; anyone else, neither is, nor can
be his friend and foe. By accepting his affinity with the world,
he is his enemy and by accepting no affinity in the least, with
the world, he is his friend.

Appendix—A man himself, rather than anybody else, is
"
742,"Verse 5] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 705
responsible for his salvation (God-realization) or for his downfall.
God has bestowed upon us this human body and he has also
gifted us with all the requisites. Therefore for salvation no other ~
person is needed, similarly no one else is responsible for our
fall. The person himself by becoming attached to the modes,
takes repeated birth and death (Gita 13/21).
Preceptor (spiritual guides), saints and God lead a man
to salvation when a man himself has faith and belief in them,
accepts them, has an inclination towards them, takes refuge in
them and carries out their orders. If he does not accept them as
their own, how will they lead him to salvation? They can’t. If
he does not became a disciple, what will the ‘guru’ (spiritual
guide) do? As other persons will provide food to a (hungry)
man but the hunger should be his own. If he has no hunger of —
his own, what is the use of the food provided to him by others?
Similarly if a striver is not sincerely devoted to his aim, what is :
the utility of the gospel preached by the spiritual guide, saints .
and exalted souls?
There is never lack of spiritual guides, saints and God. There -
have been many great saints, preceptors and incarnations, but we
have not attained salvation. It proves that we have not accepted
them. Therefore we ourselves are responsible for our salvation
and ruin. He, who thinks others responsible for his salvation and
fall, can never attain salvation.
In fact God is present, the preceptor is present, the supreme
truth is present and ability and strength in a striver are also
present. The only obstacle to their revelation, is the attachment
to the perishable pleasures. The responsibility to wipe out this
attachment to pleasures, goes to the striver because he himself
has been attached to them.
Initiation (initiating or being initiated) is not the principle of
the Gita. A man is his own preceptor, therefore he has to preach
the gospel to his own self. When all is God (Vasudevah sarvam),
"
743,"706 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 6

then who except God is a preceptor and who will preach the
gospel and to whom will he preach it? Therefore the expression
‘uddharedatmanatmanarh’ means that instead of perceiving defects -
in others, a man should perceive defects in his own self and try

to get rid of them and preach the gospel to himself. He himself
should become his preceptor, he himself should become his
leader and he himself should become his ruler.

he himself, his friend or enemy? The Lord, provides an answer,
in the verse that follows. |

SRNR SATA FS:

SIS MATA ATH STAN .

bandhuratmatmanastasya yenatmaivatmana _jitah

anatmanastu§ Satrutve vartetaétmaiva Séatruvat

To him, who has conquered his self by himself, his own self
is a friend; but to him who has not conquered the self, his own
self acts as his foe. 6
Comment:—

""Bandhuratmatmanastasya yenatmaivatmana jitah'—Nothing
resides, in a man except, the pure self. He does not at all depend,
on the lower self viz., body, senses, mind and intellect etc. He
renounces his dependence on these altogether, and gets established
in his own self. He is the one, who has conquered himself.

How to know, that a man is established in his own self?
When his mind is set well in equanimity, it means that he is |
established in his own self, because the Absolute is, free from
blemish and is equanimous (Gita 5/19). It means that by being
established in the Absolute he has conquered himself by his
own self. Actually he was already established in the Absolute,
"
744,"Verse 6] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 707
but he could not realize it, as he had assumed his body, mind .
and intellect etc., as his. .

In this world, a man cannot defeat anyone without the help -
of others, and this help of others, means his own defeat. How? :
For example, if you want to defeat others, either with arms or |
with arguments, you have to depend on arms or arguments, then |
only, you can defeat others. It means that you are first defeated, :
by arms or arguments. Thus one cannot conquer others, without
his own defeat. But, one who has no need of others, in the least,
conquers himself by his own self, and he himself, is his friend.

'Anatmanastu Satrutve vartetatmaiva Satruvat'—He, who thinks,
that the body, senses, mind, intellect, riches and prosperity etc.,
are necessary, for him and who depends on them, is his own foe.

He thinks, that by accepting these as his own, he has controlled -
them and conquered them. But, the fact is, that he has been

defeated by them. When he takes his defeat as victory, it means
that his own self, is his foe. |

The term 'Satrutve', means that a man by depending on
worldly things, and by accepting his affinity with them, works _
as a foe for himself, as he himself, is sentient, but he attaches
importance to the insentient and depends on them. The more
claim, he lays on material objects, the more he becomes, a slave
to them. Further, he harbours desire for respect, honour and fame,
that lead to his fall. He concedes, that he is elevating himself
but actually it is the reverse. This proves, that he himself, is his
own enemy, in disguise.

How surprising it is, that a man by attaching importance to
matter, by forgetting God-realization, as the real aim of human life,
wants to maintain the memory of his so-called body, and name
by his photos and statues, during the lifetime, as well as after
death! Thus, he in spite of being sentient (self), gets entangled
in the slavery of matter, (non-self) and acts as his foe.

By using the term ‘Satruvat', Lord Krsna means to explain, :
"
745,"708 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
that a man by accepting his affinity with the body, senses, mind
and intellect etc., thinks that he has become their master but
actually he is their slave. Though, he does not think of harm
to himself, yet the consequences are harmful and ruinous, and
so Lord Krsna has declared, that his own self acts as his foe,
because, dependence on the mundane, finally misleads a man,
to the cycle of birth and death.
Appendix—If a man has not the sense of ‘I? and ‘mine’ in
respect of his body, he himself is his friend and if he has the
sense of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ in the body, he himself is like an enemy
to himself viz., by giving existence to the non-self, he acts like
an enemy to himself. ‘Satruvat’—-Whatever loss an enemy causes,
the same loss he himself incurs. In fact as much loss a voluptuary
does to himself, so much loss can’t be done even by an enemy. -
If we perceive in the right perspective, we come to know that
an enemy does only good to us. He cannot do evil to us. The -
reason is that he can have an access only to objects, he can’t
reach the self. Therefore what more can he do than to destroy
the perishable? The destruction of the perishable will do us -
good only. In fact we sustain loss only, if we nurse ill-feelings.

The self-conquered one whose mind is perfectly calm, in the
midst of antithetical pairs, such as cold and heat, favourable and
unfavourable, joy and sorrow, honour and dishonour, is in constant
communion with, the Supreme-Spirit. 7
"
746,"Verse 7] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 709
Comment:—
[In the sixth verse, the term 'Anatmanah' (of unconquered
self), and the term 'Jitatmanah' (of the self-controlled), have been _
used. It means that man who accepts his affinity of ‘I'ness and
‘Mineness', with the body etc., his own self, acts as the foe.
But a self-controlled person, who does not accept his affinity,
with mundane objects, such as body etc., as his own self is his
friend. In this way, the man of unconquered self, ruins himself,
while a self-controlled man, remains in communion with the
Supreme-Spirit. ]
'Jitatmanah'—One, who has not the least, affinity with the
mundane, such as body, senses, mind and intellect etc., is self-
disciplined or self-controlled. Such a self-controlled man, does
good to himself, as well as to the world. | _
'‘Sitosnasukhaduhkhesu prasantasya'—Here, ‘Sita’ and ""Usna’
do not denote only cold and heat, ‘Sita’ and 'Usna’ are merely, -
objects of touch. A self-controlled person, is really he who :
controls all senses, from sense-objects. Therefore, ‘Sita’ and
'‘Usna’, cannot be taken in a limited sense. They denote, favourable -
and unfavourable circumstances. It means, that one should not
be pleased with favourable circumstances and incidents etc., or
displeased with unfavourable circumstances and incidents etc.,
but remain perfectly calm, in the midst of the two.
In favourable circumstances, a man feels a sort of, coolness,
while in unfavourable circumstances he feels a kind of warmth.
A striver, should be cautious that his permanent peace is not
disturbed, by this seemingly cold and heat. He should not be happy
and sad, with favourable and unfavourable circumstances.
Now let us try to understand what ‘Joy’, and ‘Sorrow’, imply: :
(i) Generally, people think that a person who lives in luxury
is joyful, but one who cannot enjoy luxuries, is sorrowful.
(ii) A man, does not possess even the bare necessities of
"
747,"710 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
life, but is satisfied with what he possesses, and is joyful, while
the man who leads a life of luxury is worried at heart, lest the
luxuries should be lost and is sad or sorrowful. _
In the Gita, 'sukha’ and ‘duhkha’, have been described,
in two ways. The favourable circumstances and pleasure
derived out of these is called ‘sukha’. Similarly, unfavourable
circumstances and sorrow derived from these is called 'duhkha’.
Where in the Gita it is said, 'samaduhkhasukhah' (12/13; 14/24),
'sitosnasukhaduhkhesu samah' (12/18), it means, that he remains
evenminded in 'sukha’, and ‘duhkha'. But where the Gita says,
‘Dvandvairvimuktah sukhaduhkhasanjfiath’, there, it refers to
the void of 'sukha' (pleasure) and ‘duhkha (pain). In the former
case, ‘sukha' and ‘duhkha’, have their entities but one remains
equanimous, without being affected by them. In the latter case, _
there is no entity of either 'sukha' or ‘duhkha’. In sum total, both
lead to the same goal. | | -
Now, a question rises, why Lord Krsna, has used two pairs _~
of opposites 'Sita and Usna'’ (coldandheat) and 'Sukhaduhkha’
| (joy and sorrow), when ‘cold’ and ‘heat’ also stand for favourable = -
and unfavourable circumstances. The explanation, is that past- _
actions result in favourable and unfavourable circumstances,
while actions of the present, result in success and failure, (joy
and sorrow). But a self-controlled man, remains perfectly calm
and serene, in both states.
This explanation, seems to fit the context, because the
expression 'Nendriyarthesu anusajjate', used in the fourth verse
of this chapter, has been referred to here, by the expression ‘Sita-
Usna’', while the expression 'Na karmasu anusajjate’ used there has
been specified by the expression ‘Sukha-Duhkha’. It means, that |
where it is mentioned that he remains detached in favourable and
unfavourable circumstances as a result of the fruit of past actions,
while in success and failure, as the fruit of present actions. Here,
it is mentioned that he remains calm, in both cases.
"
748,"Verse 7] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 71

'Tatha mandpamanayoh'—He is perfectly calm in honour and
dishonour also. Now, a question arises, that honour or dishonour,
is also a result of actions of the past, and therefore, is included _
in favourable and unfavourable circumstances. The explanation,
is that in favourable and unfavourable circumstances, no one else,
becomes an instrument, while in honour and dishonour (including
praise and censure), someone else, becomes the instrument. But,
the self-controlied man remains calm, whether he is honoured
or dishonoured, by others. |

In honour, a striver should not think that it is the result of
his virtuous or good actions, but he should consider it, a virtue of
the person who has shown honour to him. While, he should think _
of dishonour, as a result of his past actions, and feel obliged to
the other person, who has purged him of his sins, by becoming
an instrument of dishonour. Thus a striver, will become calm
in honour and dishonour.

'‘Paramatma samahitah'—Equanimity, in cold and heat, joy and -
sorrow, honour and dishonour, proves that he has attained God-
realization, because without internal bliss, a man cannot remain
calm, in both favourable and the unfavourable circumstances,
success and failure or honour and dishonour. Therefore, Lord
Krsna, in the Gita has declared in 5/19, ""Men whose mind is
established in equanimity, have conquered, the mortal plane"";
and in 6/22, He declares, ""Getting into the infinite beatitude of
the Self, he does not reckon any other gain greater than that,
and wherein established he is not moved, even by the heaviest
affliction"" and so on.

Appendix—He, whose own self is like a friend viz., who has
not the sense of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ in the body, remains equanimous
and unaffected in favourable and unfavourable circumstances,
pleasure and pain, honour and dishonour. Such a man is an
"
749,"712 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA (Chapter 6
enlightened Karmayogt viz., he has realized God—this should
be recognised. The reason is that favourable and unfavourable
circumstances, pleasure and pain, honour and dishonour are -
fleeting but God ever remains the same. .

same, is spoken of, as one who has attained God-realisation. 8
Comment:— a _

' Jianavijhanatrptatma'—It is in the context of the, Discipline
of Action. So here, the knowledge how to perform an action is
‘Jnana’, and equanimity in success and failure is, ""Vijhana’.

, _ Action, thought and trance, performed respectively with

the physical, subtle and causal body, for one's own self, is not
knowledge (Jiiana), because it and its fruits have a beginning
and an end. But himself being a fragment of God, is eternal.
So, how can the transient and insentient, satisfy the eternal and
sentient? This knowledge, that actions and their fruits cannot
satisfy his own self, is knowledge (Jiana). By having this
knowledge, when a person remains equanimous in success and
failure, that is called ""Vijfiana’. He himself gets satisfied with
‘Jnana’ and 'Vijiana'. Thus for him nothing remains to be done,
to be known and to be achieved.

'Kiitasthah’'—'Kuta’, is a block of iron on which things made
of iron, silver and gold etc., are hammered into different shapes,
by smiths, but it remains the same. Similarly, the self-disciplined

'Vijitendriyah'—A striver, following the Discipline of Action,
has to conquer the senses, because while performing actions, he
may have attachment and aversion. Therefore, Lord Krsna in 12/11 OB
has said, ‘Subduing your mind, senses etc., relinquish the fruit
of all actions.’ It means, that in abandoning the fruit of action,
senses have to be subdued. Thus a striver who, while following
the spiritual discipline remains careful in subduing his senses,
his senses, are finally conquered when he realizes God.
‘Samalostasmakaficanah'—To a Yogi, a clod, a stone and
a piece of gold, are the same. In dealings, he knows the value _
of each one of them. So, he keeps gold.in the shelf, while lets
a clod and a stone, lie outside. But he remains equanimous, in
gain and loss. He views all the things of the world, with an
equal eye, because he knows that all of these, are transient. He 7
remains established in God, Who pervades everywhere equally, ;
and His axiomatic equanimity, abides in him. | -
'Yukta ityucyate yogi'—Such a Karmayogi, satisfied with
‘Jnana’ (knowledge), and 'Vijnana’ (equanimity), unshaken in all oe
circumstances, with senses subdued, and equanimous, is spoken
of as a Yogi viz., one who has attained Yoga or equanimity.

He, who regards well-wishers, friends, foes, neutrals, mediators,
the hateful, the relatives, saints and sinners, all alike, stands out
supreme. 9
Comment:—
[In the eighth verse, there is description of equanimity in
"
751,"714 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
objects, while here there is description of equanimity, in persons.
The objects, cannot perform any action, while persons perform
actions for themselves as also, for others.-So, it is difficult for .
them. to have equanimity in them. Therefore, the person who =
has a benevolent and impartial, attitude to all and regards them
alike, even after noticing differences, in their conduct stands
out supreme. ] .
‘Suhrnmitraryudasinamadhyasthadvesyabandhusu'—-One, who
is engrossed in the welfare of others, like a mother, without any
selfish motive, is called 'Suhrd' (disinterested friend), while one
who returns good for good, is a friend.
The foe, is he who does evil to others without any cause,
but the hateful is one, who does evil to others, having some
selfish motive or any other cause. — | -
The neutral, is he who remains indifferent, to two groups or
men, if they are fighting and the mediator, is one who desires -
compromise, for the welfare of both. -
He has a benevolent and impartial attitude, towards his
relatives, as well as those hostile, to him. -
'Sadhusvapi ca papesu samabuddhirvisisyate'—His dealing,
with saints and sinners, is different but he thinks about the
welfare of both of them, and also does good to them equally,
because according to him all persons, are different manifestations
of the same Divinity. As the Lord, is a disinterested friend, of
all beings (Gita 5/29), the Yogi is also a disinterested friend, of
all beings, (Srimadbhagavata 3/25/21).
Here, Lord Krsna, by using the phrase 'Sadhusvapi ca papesu’,
means that if he regards saints and sinners alike, he will regard
all people alike, because men are judged by their actions. The
Lord, also lays emphasis on conduct (actions), by declaring,
""Whatever a great man does, the same is done by others""
(Gita 3/21). If he regards men who perform virtuous actions,
"
752,"Verse 9] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 715
and also those who perform evil actions alike, it means, that
he stands supreme, because it is difficult to have a benign and
equanimous attitude for the sinners.
In the world, people generally have a tendency to observe
actions of others. By doing so, they cannot observe their real
self, that remains the same, while actions always undergo
changes. Secondly, they specially observe, evil actions of others
which mislead observers to degradation, because, by doing so,
they attach much importance, to those evil actions. Therefore,
Lord Krsna in this verse, has explained that a Yogi regards
saints and sinners alike, because he believes that God alone,
creates the phenomenon and so, all that is God. Thus, the Yogi
stands supreme.
;
According to the gospel of Gita, ‘Equanimity is called ;
‘Yoga’ (2/48). One who attains equanimity does not need any :
other virtue, for God-realization. He becomes wholly virtuous
spontaneously, and he conquers the mortal plane (5/19). In Visnu _
Purana, Prahlada has said, that equanimity is God's adoration
(1/17/90). We can attain, such a significant equanimity, by
being free from evil. The means to be free from evils, are (1) Do
not regard anyone as evil. (ii) Do not do any harm to anyone.
(1) Do not think ill of anyone. (iv) Do not perceive evils in
others. (v) Do not hear evil of others. (vi) Do not speak ill, of
others. By following these six rules, we shall be free from evil.
As soon as, we are free from evil, we shall become virtuous,
because virtue is our real nature.
We make efforts, and follow the spiritual discipline, in order
to, become virtuous. But, we do not become virtuous, because |
we do not renounce evil, altogether and even a fragment of an
evil, arouses pride of having virtue, which leads us to several
other evils. But when evil are rooted out, we become virtuous,
"
753,"716 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
spontaneously. When we become virtuous, we automatically,

do good to others. By doing so, all the world provides us the
necessities of life, without our asking and without working hard.
Thus, we cease our dependence, on the world. This freedom —
from dependence, on the world, enables us to attain equanimity,
which is axiomatic and then we have nothing to do, we become
liberated souls. .

Appendix—The sphere of evenness (equanimity) is different
from that of unequality. God is equanimous (equal) and the world _
is uneven. An enlightened Karmayogi remains equanimous, even
having different dealings with different persons. He regards a
clod, a stone, a piece of gold, a well-wisher, a friend, an enemy,

a neutral, a mediator, the hateful, a saint and a sinner alike,
though dealings with them can neither be the same, nor should
be the same and cannot be done the same. The reason is that __
he has realized, ‘there is. nothing else besides God’. _
- If there is an idol of Lord Visnu made of gold and there is -
toy-dog made of gold, both having the same weight will also
cost the same. Lord Visnu is the best and most venerable Deity __
while the dog is a mean and untouchable animal, in outward
dealings there is a vast difference between the two but as far
as the metal, gold is concerned, there is no difference between
the two. Similarly in the world there is outward diversity among
people as a friend, a foe, an exalted soul, a wicked person;
good, bad, gentle, vile, virtuous, sinful, righteous, immoral,
learned and foolish etc., but in essence all of them are only
the manifestation of God. Only God has revealed Himself in
different forms. He who knows this fact recognizes Him, others
don’t recognize Him.
- While bathing, when soap is applied to the body, if the
body is seen in a mirror, it looks bad and clumsy. At certain
parts, marks like blisters appear, somewhere lines appear. But
the person does not feel sad that he is suffering from a disease.
"
754,"Verse 10] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 717
The reason is that he knows that these marks will be rubbed
off when the body is washed in water. Similarly all beings are
the manifestations of God but outwardly they appear different -
because of difference in bodies and their nature. In fact in spite
of their different appearance, they are the manifestations of
God but it is because of our attachment and aversion that they
appear different. |
The fact which was mentioned in the second verse of the fifth
chapter by the expression ‘Karmayoga Visisyate’ (Karmayoga is
superior to Sankhyayoga), the same fact has been mentioned here
by the expression ‘samabuddhirvisisyate’. An equanimous person
remains untainted. Untaintedness leads to yoga while taintedness
leads to “‘bhoga’. There is equanimity in the three yogas but it
is specially important in Karmayoga, because Karmayoga being ~
the worldly spintual discipline, a Karmayogi faces more oddities .
in life than other yogis. ;

Link: —Equanimity (evenness of mind), which is attained -
by the Discipline of Action, is also attained by the Discipline
of Meditation. So Lord Krsna, while starting the subject of
meditation, gives inspiration for meditation.

A Dhyanayogi, should constantly engage in meditation, living
alone in seclusion, having subdued his mind and body, and having
got rid of bonds of desires and possessions for enjoyment. 10
Comment:—
[Here Lord Krsna is describing in detail, the Discipline of
Meditation, which was referred to in brief, in the twenty-seventh
"
755,"718 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
and twenty-eighth verses of the fifth chapter. Here, the word
""Yoga', which has been derived, from the root ""Yuj samadhau'
means, controlling the activities of the mind.]
‘Aparigrahah'—Meditation, is practised by disinclination for
the world, and inclination for God. For its practice, the first means
to be adopted, 1s 'Aparigrahah’. 'Aparigrahah' means freedom from
accumulation of possessions. Nothing, should be accumulated for
one's pleasures, because mind is attracted towards possessions
and pleasures, and so it cannot be engaged in meditation.
""Nirasih'—It means, that a striver should not be free from
outward prosperity and pleasures only, but also should get rid
of desires and hopes for prosperity and pleasures, because these
are all obstacles to God-realization. Therefore, a striver should
always be aware of these desires and hopes. |
'Yatacittatma'—Even, by renouncing pleasures and prosperity,
and also desire for them, there is possibility of attachment. -
Therefore, a striver should keep his body and mind under control. -
By controlling them, new attachment will not be aroused. The
means to control them, is that no action should be performed -
being attached to it, because attachment leads a body to laziness
and idleness, and senses, to pleasures, and mind, to the thought
of pleasures and futile thinking. |
""Yogi'—A Yogi, is one who is devoted to meditation,
- whose aim is only God-realization, rather than enjoyment and
accomplishment.
‘Ekaki'—A striver, should live alone, without any assistant,
because in company he is likely to be engaged in conversation.
In the absence of company because of attachment to him he
is likely to be haunted by that. Thus he will not be able to
meditate on God. |
'Rahasi sthitah'—A striver, should live in seclusion, on the
banks of a river, or in a forest, or a temple, or a lonely room,
meant for adoration and meditation only. The atmosphere, should
"
756,"Verse 10] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 719
be such, that there is no hindrance in meditation.

‘Atm4nam satatarn yufijita'—Thus a striver, living alone in
seclusion, as mentioned above, should concentrate his mind on -
God, with a firm determination to be engaged only, in meditation
without having the least thought, of worldly affairs, whatsoever _
might happen. He, should be on the alert, because alertness is
spiritual discipline.

A striver, should think of God, not only at the time of
meditation, but also while performing other actions, without
any attachment to these, because the thought of God, helps
in meditation, while the thought of God in meditation, helps a
striver in thinking of Him, during his mundane affairs. It means,
that a striver should always remember that he is a striver viz.,
he should always remember God, and think of Him, even when -
he performs worldly actions. He should harbour, no thought of
any worldly transaction, otherwise it will be a hindrance, in his :
meditation. Therefore, while sitting for meditation, he should :
have a firm resolve, that he has to meditate only on God,
whatever may happen. By this resolve, it will be easy for him -
to meditate on God.

A striver has a complaint, that he cannot concentrate his mind,
on God. The reason, is that he wants to concentrate his mind on
God, without breaking off his affinity, for the world. Therefore,

a striver should break off his affinity, for the world as it is this
affinity or attachment, or a sense of mine, which influences the
mind. Therefore, a striver can concentrate his mind and engage in
meditation, by only having the aim of God-realization and being
detached from all persons and things etc. If such detachment is
not there, these will haunt his memory. : |

Initially, Arjuna was prepared to wage the war and he also

got prepared at last. But, in between he thought that to wage
"
757,"720 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
war was a sin. Thus, it was a question, of performing an action
or not to perform it. So, it arose in the context of the Discipline
of Action. But how other disciplines, such as of Knowledge,
Devotion and Meditation were explained, in Gita. | - |
Arjuna retreats from the war, because he thinks that sin,
would. accrue to him, by killing his kinsmen. So he requests.
Lord Krsna, to tell him what was good for him (2/7; 3/2; 5/1).
Therefore, Lord Krsna explains to him, the different means
including gifts, rituals, penances, study of the Vedas and different
kinds of disciplines leading to God-realisation. But, in all the
means, Lord Krsna has emphasized the fact that the aim to attain
perishable things, is the main obstacle, to God-realization. If a
striver, has only the aim of God-realization, and performs actions
with equanimity those actions, would lead him to salvation or
God-realization. a -
Appendix—Karmayoga,* Jnanayoga and Bhaktiyoga are the
Karananirapeksa disciplines (independent of sense and other 7
organs) but Dhyanayoga (the Discipline of Meditation) is a
Karanasapeksa discipline (dependent on sense and other organs).
Now the Lord starts the description of Dhyanayoga. :

Having well arranged his seat (Asana) in a clean and unpolluted

place covered by KuSa-grass, a deer-skin and a cloth, one over the

other, neither too high, nor too low. 11 — ,

Comment:— oe

- ‘'Sucau dese'—The place, is pure in two ways—{(i) A naturally

pure place such as the bank of the Ganges, a forest and the place

near a holy basil, myrobalan (Arnvala), Pipala tree etc. (ii) Place

cleaned with cow-dung and by sprinkling water, or by removing

two inches of soil from the surface. A clean place of natural

beauty, invigorates and elevates the mind.
'CailajinakuSottaram'—According to the text a Kusa-grassmat,

a deer-skin, and a cloth, should be spread one over the other*

yet there should be spread a Kusa mat below, a deer-skin in |

the middle and a cloth at the top. The deer-skin should be of a -

deer, which is not killed, but which is dead, in the natural way,

as the skin of deer, which is killed is regarded, as impure. If a -

deer-skin, is not available, a rug can be spread. Over the rug, -

soft cotton cloth should be spread. KuSa-grass, is supposed to be

made from the hair of, boar-incarnation of the Lord and thus is ~

considered holy. Deer-skin is spread over a KuSa-grass mat, so

that Kusa-grass may not prick the skin and an electric current

of a body, may not pass through the KuSa-grass, to the earth, as

a deer-skin is a bad conductor, of electric current. A soft cotton

cloth is spread over the deer-skin, so that the bristles of deer-skin,

may not stick into the body and the striver feels comfortable.
‘Natyucchritam natinicam'—The seat of the plank-bed,

should neither be too high, nor too low, because if it is too

high, a striver while meditating may doze off, fall down and be

injured; but if it is too low, creeping insects, may disturb him

in his meditation. -
* The order of the text does not seem reasonable and proper because KuSa-

grass pricks the body. Therefore, it should be interpreted as a KuSa-grassmat

below, a deer-skin in the middle and a cloth at the top, because the order of the

meaning is more forceful than the order of the text.
"
759,"722 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
'Pratisthapya sthiramasanamatmanah'—The platform or the
plank-bed, should be fixed firmly. Moreover it should belong
to him and be used by him only, because there may be bacilli -
in it, of others, if it is used by them. Similarly, a striver should SO
have his own rosary, a bag for the rosary, and a spoon, used
in religious ceremonies etc. Not only this, but according to the
ordinance of scriptures, a striver should not use the seat, shoes
and shirts etc., of others, otherwise he has to be a sharer in their
virtues and sins. One should not sit, on the seat of saints and
ascetics because, it is a dishonour to them. If one touches their
seats and clothes etc., with feet, then it is also, a sin.

While seated on his seat, concentrating the mind and controlling
the thinking faculty (citta) and the senses, he should practise Yoga, 7
for self-purification. 12
Comment:— a
[After explaining the kind of a seat, now Lord Krsna, in
the twelfth and thirteenth verses, explains the process, how one
should practise meditation. ]
‘Tatra asane'—This phrase, has been used for the seat
with a KuSa-grassmat, a deer-skin and a cloth, described in the
previous verse. |
""Upavisya'—He should sit still on the seat, in a comfortable
posture, as 'Siddhasana’, 'Padmasana’ or ‘Sukh4sana’, etc., without |
moving the body. It is said, about the posture that a striver
should be able to sit in that posture continuously for three hours,
without moving the body. By doing so, the mind and life-breath
"
760,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 723
naturally become calm, and free from volatility. Volatility of mind,
does not allow the body to remain motionless. The motion of
the body and urge for action do not allow the mind, to remain _
steady and calm. Therefore, it is very essential that the body
should remain motionless.
'Yatacittendriyakriyah'—Whiule seated, the mind and the senses
should be kept under control. A striver should control his body,
senses and mind, even in practical life, otherwise they cannot be
controlled easily, while he meditates. It means, that he should
lead a regulated and disciplined life, as has also been pointed
out, in the sixteenth and seventeenth verses of this chapter.
‘Ekagrarh manah krtva'—While meditating, he should make
a firm resolve, that he has to engage himself only in meditation.
If however, worldly thoughts crop up, he should think, that it is -
time only for meditation and not for worldly thoughts. If time
passes in worldly thoughts, no useful purpose will be served, and 7
he will be a loser, both ways. Thus, he should concentrate his -
mind, on God, without having any thought of mundane affairs.
Even then, if a worldly thought comes to the mind, he should -
neither support it nor oppose it. By doing so, the thought will
disappear as it is transitory. The thought, affects him, only if
he accepts his affinity with it, but if he remains indifferent to it
will automatically perish, because it is perishable and transient.
In the world, there are good and bad actions. If we do not have
any affinity with them, they would not affect us. Similarly during
meditation, if we do not have any affinity, with thoughts, our
mind will not get tainted. It will remain calm and composed.
'Yufijyadyogamatmavisuddhaye'—One should practise the
Yoga of meditation for self-purification. Desire for worldly things,
pleasures, honour, praise, name and fame etc., is impurity of the
self, and by renouncing all the desires, to have the only aim of
God-realization, is self-purification. : :
Yoga, is a power which can be used either for accomplishing
"
761,"724 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6

worldly pleasures, or for God-realization. If it is used ‘for worldly

accomplishments, it cannot be helpful in self-purification or

God-realization. But if it is used for God-realization, it will be

conducive to God-realization. | : Te

sampreksya nasikagram svam disaScanavalokayan

Let him hold the trunk, head and neck straight and steady,
gazing at the tip of his nose, without looking around. 13
Comment:—

‘Samam kayasirogrivarn dharayannacalam'—The portion of -
the body from the neck to waist, is called ‘Kaya’ (trunk), while ;
the portion from neck to top is called, head. All postures are -
useful, from meditation and health point of view. Out of those
postures, Lord Krsna has taken the essential feature, necessary
for meditation, 1.e., to keep neck, back and head in a straight -
position. While meditating, the trunk, head and neck should be
held straight, so that the spinal cord may remain vertical. In this
posture, the mind becomes calm and concentrated quickly. If one
bends forward, he feels drowsy, if he bends backward, there is
stupor and if he bends sideways, he becomes capricious. If he
feels drowsy, he should walk a little, and then again with a firm
determination, should repractise meditation by holding the trunk,
head and neck straight.

'DisaScanavalokayan'—-He should not look in any direction,
because by looking here and there, the neck will bend, which will
disturb his meditation. So the neck should be held straight.

'Sampreksya nasikagramm svam'—He should look at the tip
of his nose, with his half-closed eyes. If he closes his eyes, he
"
762,"Verse 14] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 725

may feel sleepy. But if the eyes are open, he is likely to look

at the other objects within sight and so there may be distraction

in meditation. Thus, Lord Krsna means to say, that he should ee
keep his eyes half-closed, because by doing so, the eye-balls

assume steadiness and seem as if they are looking at the tip of

the nose.

‘Sthirah’'—He should sit steady, without any activity of the
body or senses, just like a statue continuously for three hours.
Moreover, there should not be any activity of the mind also. By
doing so, he will overcome the strain of the posture and will
become ‘Jitasana’ (conqueror of the posture).

Appendix—Here gazing at the tip of the nose is not important
but concentration of the mind is important.

Link:—Blissful meditation (Yoga) on God, (endowed with -
attributes and form) and the good flowing out of it, have been -
explained, in the next two verses.

Serene and fearless, firm in the vow of celibacy, with mind
controlled, the vigilant Yogi should sit meditating on Me and having
Me alone, as the Supreme Goal. 14
Comment:—

'Prasantatma'—Serene-minded, is he who is free from
attachment and aversion. Attachment and aversion of the striver,
whose aim is only God-realization, without having any worldly
desire, (by becoming languid) perish, and with the disappearance
of attachment and aversion, a striver attains peace, which is
spontaneous. It means, that attachment and aversion, born of
"
763,"726 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
the affinity for the world, disturb serenity or peace. One, who
attains this peace, is serene-minded. | a
""Vigatabhih'—Fear of disease, censure, dishonour and |
death arise, only because man accepts the affinity of 'T'ness and
Mineness, with the body. But when he abandons this affinity, he
becomes free from all fears, because he thinks that even if the
body perishes, it will make no difference as his mind dedicated
to God, he will attain salvation, the ultimate goal of life.
""Brahmacirivrate sthitah'—Here, it does not mean only vow
of continence, but also includes that a celibate should lead a
disciplined and controlled life, according to the order of his
preceptor, free from sensual pleasures, honour, praise and comforts
etc. He should not in the least, enjoy worldly things in any state,
under any circumstance, either during meditation, or in practical
life, but use them only as necessities of life. -
‘Manah samyamya maccittah’'—Having controlled the mind _ -
of all worldly affairs, he should think of God's form, play, -
virtues, glory and excellence etc. It means, that by shutting out
all worldly thoughts, he should devote his mind to God only. _
The thoughts that come to mind, are either of the past or the
present. So he should neglect them, by thinking that these have
no existence at present. Moreover, the world actually does not
exist, 1t merely seems to exist, while God existed in the past,
exists now and will also exist, in future. So, he should think of _
Him, instead of thinking about the world.
""Yuktah'—He should remain vigilant, in diverting his mind
from worldly affairs and concentrate it on God, even while engaged
in worldly affairs, because vigilance during engagement in worldly
affairs, will help him in meditation, and that awareness during
meditation will be helpful to him, in his practical life.
'Asita matparah'—While sitting, he should have the only aim
of God-realization, without having any other desire, or lust or
attachment or mineness, in the least, as has also been pointed
"
764,"Verse 15} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 727
out, in the tenth verse of this chapter.
Appendix—To consider any special trait as one’s own is to
invite demoniac nature in oneself. Therefore the Lord by the SO
term ‘matparah’ mentions that the striver following the path of
meditation should depend on Him. By depending on God, evils
(flaws) are quickly removed and the striver is not proud of his
speciality. This is the special trait of devotion.
In this verse ‘mana’ and ‘citta’—these are two terms which
are synonyms have been used. With ‘mana’ anything is reflected
upon time and again and with ‘citta’ only one thing is thought
of. Therefore here the expression ‘manah satnyamya maccitah’
means that the world should not be reflected upon viz., detach
‘mana’ from the world and with ‘citta’ he should think of God
viz., concentrate ‘citta’ on God. _

Thus, constantly meditating on Me, the Yogi of controlled

Comment:—
""Yogi niyatamanasah'—One, who has controlled his mind is
called ‘'Niyatamanasah’. A Yogi's mind, can be subdued, only if
his exclusive aim is God-realization, without having any affinity
for the world. Affinity for the world, does not allow the mind
to be subdued.
A striver commits an error, if he thinks that he is a
householder, having some caste, creed and colour etc. Thus
he cannot meditate. A striver, should think that he is a striver,
"
765,"728 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
whose only aim is to meditate on God. His aim is not to attain,
mystic power. Thus, by changing his ‘I'ness, he will be able to
concentrate his mind, on God. With the change of 'T’ sense, the - = — |
inner sense would automatically change. |
- Yuiijannevarh sadatmanam'—The word 'Evam’ (thus), has

been used for meditation and concentration of mind, described
from the tenth to the fourteenth verses.

""Yunjan atmanam’ means, that a striver should concentrate
his mind on God, diverting it from the world. 'Sada' means that
he should practise meditation regularly, in seclusion and daily
life, always having the aim of God-realization. Such practice,
leads to an early success.

'Santim nirvanaparamam matsamsthamadhigacchati'—This
is a state, when established, nothing further remains to be |
attained. This state, is called Supreme-Peace or Supreme-Bliss  _
‘or emancipation or salvation. A striver, attains peace by breaking _
off affinity with the world, while he attains Supreme-Peace, by
attaining God-realization. The process of meditation, culminates
in 'Nirvikalpa sthiti', (state of mind where there is absence of _
all thoughts). But, this is also a state, as it does not remain
constant, as there is deviation from it, at times. This is not
God-realization. Further to it, there is 'Nirvikalpa bodha’, which
is Self-realization (God-realization). This is called Supreme-
Peace. The same Supreme-Peace (in 5/12) has been called,
'‘Naisthikim Santim' (final peace) and (in 9/31) 'Sa$vacchanti'
(Eternal Peace). |

natyasnatastu. yogo'sti na caikantamanasnatah
na cati svapnaSilasya jagrato naiva carjuna
Yoga is not successful for him who eats too much, nor for ~
one, who does not eat at all; or for him who sleeps too much, nor
too little. 16 .
Comment:—
'NatyaSnatastu yogo'sti'—Yoga is not possible, for him who
eats too much.* Too much eating, causes thirst for water. So he
has to drink much water. Too much water, makes the stomach
heavy and the body too. If he overeats, he becomes dull and
lazy, and may suffer from indigestion, which causes disease in
the body. So he cannot concentrate his mind, in adoration and
spiritual practice etc. So how can Yoga be possible for him? .
'Na caikantamanasnatah'—Yoga, is also not possible, for ~
him who eats too little. If he is underfed, he will feel hungry,
think of food again and again, and become weak. His body, will :
languish and life will become hard to live. He will be inclined to ;
keep lying down. It will be hard, to sit for meditation. Thus he
cannot concentrate his mind, on God. So how is Yoga possible -
for him?
""Na cati svapnasilasya'—Oversleep, makes a striver idle,
lazy and inert. In oversleep, the striver cannot sleep soundly,
and so different thoughts come to the mind. Thus, oversleep is
a hindrance to the practice of meditation. | |
‘Jagrato naiva carjuna'—This Yoga is not possible for him,
who sleeps too little. By keeping aware he feels drowsy, and
cannot practise meditation. |
Men, of sattvika disposition, while having spiritual discussions,
narrating and listening to lives of saints, devotees and incarnations
of God, have so much joy and get so much engrossed in them,
that they do not feel drowsy, at all even by remaining awake,
*If a person's food is less than that of others but is more than his appetite,
it is known as too much.
"

throughout a night. This wakefulness helps them reach a state,
which transcends the three modes of. Nature (prakrti).

Similarly, devotees in adoration, loud chanting and constant — —. ~~... ~
remembrance of God, are so much engrossed, that they do not
feel hungry. This cannot be said as 'not eating’ (3t19d:) because
all doings by men while devoted to God, become ‘Sat’.

yuktaharaviharasya yuktacestasya karmasu

yuktasvapnavabodhasya yogo bhavati duhkhaha

Yoga which brings out the cessation of the travails of the world _
is accomplished only by him, who is moderate in diet and recreation,
temperate in action and regulated in sleep, and wakefulness. 17 _
Comment:—_ . | -

""Yuktaharaviharasya'—Food (livelihood) should be earned,
by honest means, it should be pure, easily digestible, light, a -
bit less than necessary and items of food must be in accordance
with, the ordinance of scriptures and Ayurveda. Recreation, such
as physical exercise and walking etc., should be resorted to,
moderately.

""Yuktacestasya karmasu'—All actions, should be performed,
according to one's caste, creed, country, condition and capacity,
following the ordinance of the scriptures, and happily for the
welfare of others. , :

""Yuktasvapnavabodhasya'—One, should be moderate in sleep.

He should remain awake in the day, go to bed early at night,
and rise early in the morning. Here, the term 'Avabodhasya’,
(wakefulness) has a special meaning, that a striver should be
spiritually aroused, as this human life has been bestowed upon
him, to attain salvation. The term ""Yukta’ (moderate), means, that
"
768,"Verse 17] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 731
similar rules do not apply to all the persons for diet, recreations,
actions, sleep and wakefulness. But, everyone should be moderate
in them, according to circumstances he is in. -
'Yogo bhavati duhkhaha'—Thus, the Yoga of a Yogi, who ©
is moderate in diet, recreation etc., brings about a cessation of
the toil and troubles of the world.
There is an exceptional difference between, yoga (meditation)
and bhoga (pleasure). In 'yoga’ there is abnegation of ‘bhoga’.
In 'bhoga' there is not total negation of ‘yoga’. In 'bhoga’, what
happiness a man derives, is a result of disconnection of the contact
with the unreal. But, man does not pay attention to this fact, and
thinks that there is pleasure in contact, with worldly things. So,
he gets attached to sense-objects. He cannot experience yoga,
which brings about the cessation of miseries, of the world. In | ~
this Yoga, there is total negation, of worldly enjoyment. oO
|
This verse on meditation, is useful for all strivers. By following
it, they may attain salvation. There are, four factors described in 7
it—(1) moderate in diet and recreation, (2) moderate in action,
(3) moderate in sleep and (4) moderate in wakefulness.
We have twenty-four hours, at our disposal. If twenty-four
hours are divided say into four parts, we get six hours for each of
the above activities (1) six hours for eating, recreation and physical
exercise etc., (ii) six hours for actions for earning livelihood viz.,
farming, business and service etc., (iii) six hours for sleep and _
(iv) six hours for wakefulness viz., meditation; adoration, constant
remembrance and loud chanting etc., for God-realization.
These can also be divided into two parts (i) Income and
(11) Expenditure. Actions and wakefulness, ‘are the means of
income, while eating, recreation and sleep involve expenditure.
For income and expenditure, we have two kinds of capital—(i)
worldly riches (capital) and (ii) age.

recreation earning (spiritual
a livelihood discipline)

Let us first think about worldly capital (worldly riches). If
a person ears more, it is alright, but if his expenses are more
than income, it will not be good, it will ruin him. If a person,
devotes only four hours to eating and recreation etc., he may
devote eight hours to his profession, earning his livelihood.

Now, let us think about age. If he gets refreshed by four hours' ~—
sleep, he should devote eight hours to worship, meditation and
spiritual discipline. This spiritual discipline, should be enhanced -
everyday because we have come to be born for God-realization,
not for accumulation of mundane wealth etc.

Secondly; we should remember God, while earning our —
livelihood and also, while we go to bed. At bed time, a striver
should think that he has to devote time to devotion and adoration,
while lying in the bed. While lying down if he sleeps, it is alright
but he should not aim at sleeping. Again, when he wakes after
sleep, he should be engaged in adoration, meditation, devotion
and study of scriptures etc. While discharging his duty, or
performing actions, he should always remember, God. Thus each
and every activity of his life would become part and parcel of
one's worship. |

Appendix—The verses sixteen and seventeen are certainly
useful for the strivers following the path of meditation but they
are also very useful for strivers following other paths. |

yada viniyatam cittamatmanyevavatisthate

nihsprhah sarvakamebhyo yukta ityucyate tada

When the perfectly controlled mind is fixed on the self (Atman)
alone, free from desires for enjoyments, then the person is said to
be, an achiever of Yoga. 18
Comment:— |

[In this chapter, from the tenth to the thirteenth verses, there
is description of the seat and posture suited to meditation. In -
fourteenth and fifteenth verses, there is description of meditation -
on God (with attributes and form), with its fruit. In, sixteenth and
seventeenth verses, there is mention of regulations for all strivers -
of meditation. In the verses, from the eighteenth to the twenty-
third, there is description of meditation of the self with its result.]

""Yada viniyatam cittamatmanyevavatisthate'—'When a well
disciplined mind,* free from the thought of the world, gets
established in the self, whichever remains the same, without
any modification.’ In the self, there is enjoyment or bliss which
does not, let the mind deviate from it and thus the mind by
having this relish, gets engrossed in it. |

* The five stages of the mind are—'Mudha’, 'Ksipta’, 'Viksipta’ (confused),

‘Ekagra' (concentrated) and 'Niruddha’ (tied up). In the first two stages a striver
is not entitled for Yoga. The person with a Viksipta (confused) mind is entitled
for Yoga, his mind sometimes rests but sometimes does not rest in the self. When
the mind is concentrated, that is called ‘Savikalpa samadhi’. But the next stage is
when the mind is completely settled then that is called 'Nirvikalpa samadhi’ or
Yoga. Here in 'Viniyatarh cittam' as well as in the fifteenth verse of this chapter,
there is the hint of ‘Savikalpa samadhyr’.
"
771,"734 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 6
""Nihsprhah sarvakamebhyo yukta ityucyate tada'—When one
is completely free, from desires for all objects and pleasures,
here, as well as hereafter, he 1s called a Yogi. Se
The terms 'yada' (when) and ‘tada’ (then), denote that as soon
as, a person with disciplined mind, rests in the self alone, free
from desires for enjoyments, he becomes a Yogi.
In this verse, there are two important aspects—one is, that
the mind should rest in the self, and the other is, that it should
be free from desires, for all objects etc. It means, that when
the mind gets focussed in self, it does not think of any objects,
persons or circumstances etc., as it gets engrossed in the self.
Similarly, if mind rests in the self, the Yogi, becomes completely -
free from all desires, lust and aspiration, etc. Not only this but
he has no desire, even to have the bare necessities of life, and -
then he is a yogi, in the true sense of the term. 7
The same state, has been hinted at, in the fourth verse of this
chapter, for a Karmayogi, when the Lord declares, ""When a man -
ceases, to have attachment for sense-objects, or for actions and
_ renounces all thoughts of the world, he is said to have attained,
Yoga (6/4). The difference is, that a Karmayog! performs actions,
for others only. So, he gets totally detached, from actions and
objects. Then, he attains Yoga. A Dhyanayog! concentrates his
mind on the self, and when the mind gets established in the
self, he has no desire for actions and objects, not even, for the
bare necessities of life. It means, that a Karmayogr's desires, are
first wiped out and then he attains Yoga, while a Dhyanayogi's
mind, first gets established in the self, and then his desires are
wiped out. Thus, a Karmayogi applies his mind to the service
of the world and gets established in the self, while along with
the mind Dhyanayogi himself gets established in the self.

- yathaé dipo nivatastho nenhgate sopama smrta

‘As a lamp in a windless place, does not flicker’, this is the
simile used to describe the disciplined mind of a Yogi, practising
meditation, on the Self. 19
Comment:— |
'Yatha dipo nivatastho nengate sopama smrta, yogino
yatacittasya yuiijato yogamatmanah'—As a flame of a lamp, in
a place perfectly sheltered against wind, does not flicker, but
remains steady, in the same way when the mind of a striver,
rests in the Self alone, it becomes free, from all desires. -
The Yogi, who has subdued his mind, is called ""Yatacittasya’. -
In the preceding verse, such controlled mind has been described -
as 'Viniyata’. a
There is no place without wind, which exists everywhere. _
Somewhere, it is in its active form, while at other places, it is
inactive. Here, the term 'Nivatasthah’, does not refer to total lack
of wind, it rather refers, to the absence of its active state. |
Now, a question may arise, why the mind has been compared,
to the flame of a lamp which may flicker, and not to a mountain
which neither flickers nor shakes. The answer is, that unlike a
mountain, the mind does flicker like a flame. It is very difficult,
to keep a flickering item steady. So, it has been compared to a
flame. Secondly, as there is light in a flame, there is awareness
of God, in the mind. Though, in sound sleep and a trance, there
is an equal forgetfulness, of the world, yet, in sound sleep mind
merges in ignorance, and so there is no awareness, of the self.
In a trance the mind remains conscious of the Self. Due to these
reasons, an illustration of the flame has been given, here. This
fact, has also been pointed out, in the twenty-seventh verse of

yatroparamate cittam niruddham  yogasevaya

yatra caivatmanatmanam paSsyannatmani tusyati

When the mind, disciplined by the practice of Yoga becomes
tranquil and when the Yogi beholding the Self (Atman) by his
Self, he is contented in the self. 20
Comment:—

""Yatroparamate cittam niruddham yogasevaya, yatra— -
caivatmanatmanam pasyannatmani tusyati'—The determination to -
practise meditation on the self is ""Dharana’, while the continuous
flow of the mind, towards the self, disregarding other thoughts, _
is called ‘Dhyana’ (meditation). Meditation, has three aspects,
the meditative, (one who meditates), the act of meditation and
the aim to be achieved viz., self. So long as, there is knowledge |
about the three, it is meditation. But, when the mind gets so
much engrossed, in the aim, that nothing remains except the aim,
that state is called 'Samadhi' (trance). This is called 'Sarhprajnata
samadhi’. After practising it for a long time, it changes into
‘Asamprajnata samadhi’. The distinction between the two, is that
in the former, consciousness of the trio, regarding by way of the
object and its name and the relation between the name and the
object of meditation, persists. But in the latter, only the object
of meditation remains, by becoming oblivious of the two. The
former, is also called ‘ekagra' (concentration of mind), while the
latter 'niruddha’ (tied up state). :

The ‘samadhi’ (trance), of 'niruddha’ state, (tied up state)
"
774,"Verse 20] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 737
is also of two types—'sabija' (with seed) and ‘nirbija’ (without
seed). In the former, because of subtle desire ‘Siddhiyan’,
(accomplishments) appear. These accomplishments, are in the Te
form of worldly riches, which are obstacles to God-realization
or Self-realization. Therefore, regarding these as meaningless,
a Yogi, becomes quite indifferent to them, and then he rises to
the height of 'Nirbija samadhi' (trance without seed), which in
this verse has been referred to as 'Niruddham'’ (tied up. state of
trance).
In meditation, while having disinclination for the mundane,
a striver gets joy or peace, which is far superior, to mundane
pleasures. This joy, enhances as a striver rises to the higher
states of trance, by practising meditation. While progressing he
reaches the stage of 'Nirbija samadhi’ (trance without seed). If -
he does not enjoy ever that state of joy, then he is satisfied in
the self by the self. a ;
‘Uparamate'’ (attains quietness) means, that mind, being
insentient cannot catch the self, which is sentient. So, it becomes
quiet and at that moment, a Yogi ceases all affinity for the -
mind. oe
‘Tusyati’ means, that he is not satisfied with anything, else,
except the self. | |
The gist, of this verse is, that a Yogi realizes the self in
him, by his own self, as the Self ever remains, the same. Our
affinity, with the world, is the only obstacle to realize it. When
by meditation the mind becomes tranquil a Yogi's affinity with
the mind, and the world, is renounced and he realizes, the Self
in his own self.
The aim of human life, can be achieved by, both the Discipline
of Meditation, as well as the Discipline of Action. But, there is
a little difference between the two. In meditation, when the mind
"
775,"738 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
of a striver becomes peaceful, and does not enjoy the state of
trance, he is satisfied, in the self by the self. In the Discipline
of Action, when a striver abandons all desires of the mind, he mn nen
is satisfied in the self by the self (Gita 2/55). Se
In the Discipline of Meditation, when the mind is absorbed
in the Self, a Yogi experiences, trance. When he does not enjoy
that state, his affinity with the mind is broken off, and he is
satisfied in the self. :
In the Discipline of Action, when there is tendency of all
the actions, senses, mind, intellect and body etc., for the welfare
of others, all desires, are abandoned. As soon as, desires are
abandoned, the Yog?'s affinity, with the mind is broken off, and
he is satisfied in the self. : .
Appendix—The mind is not concentrated on the self, it can’t -
reach the self but it becomes indifferent. The reason is that the mind _
belongs to a different class from that of the self. The mind is lower _ |
(insentient) nature and the self is higher (sentient) nature. Therefore
the self rests in the self—‘atmanatmanam paSyannatmani tusyati’. -
‘Beholding the self by the self’ means that the self cannot
be perceived by senses but it can be perceived only by the self.
Whatever is thought of with the mind, that is only of sense- |
objects (the non-self), rather than of God. Whatever is determined
. With the intellect, is of the objects of the intellect, not of God.
Whatever is described with the tongue, is of the objects of the
tongue, not of God. It means that with the mind, intellect and
tongue there is reflection, determination and description which
are the evolutes of Prakrti (non-self). But God is realized by
having dissociation with the mind, intellect and tongue viz., by
renouncing affinity with them.*
* Tf thereis the only aim of God-realization, then reflection, determination and
description with the mind, intellect and tongue are not improper, but they became
the means to the end. But if a striver gets satisfied in them and thinks that he has
attained perfection, then that satiation becomes obstacle to his aim.
"
776,"Verse 21] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 739
Here the Self-realization which is attained by the Discipline
of meditation, the same is attained by Karmayoga (path of action)
(Gita 2/55). The difference is that ‘Dhyanayoga’ (Discipline of 7
Meditation) is dependent on instruments (Karanasapeksa) while
Karmayoga is a ‘Karananirapeksa’ (independent of instruments)
discipline. In ‘Karanasapeksa’ discipline, renunciation of affinity |
for Matter (non-self) is delayed and there is possibility of a -
striver’s deviation or downfall from Yoga. | :

vetti yatra na caivayam sthitascalati tattvatah _
When he feels that supreme and transcendental bliss while his
discrimination remains fully awakened, and wherein established, -
the said Yogi, never moves away from reality (tattva). 21
Comment:— |
'Sukhamiatyantikam yat'—The bliss which a Yogi feels, 1s
infinite and there cannot be any bliss greater than this because
it transcends the three attributes (modes) and is axiomatic. This
bliss, has been called an imperishable bliss (5/21), infinite bliss
(6/28) and absolute bliss (14/27).
This bliss, has been called infinite here, because, it is
superior to Sattvika joy, which is born of placidity of mind by
meditation, on God. This infinite bliss, is not born, but it is
unborn and axiomatic.
'Atindriyam'—This supreme bliss, transcends sensual pleasures.
It means, that it is superior to rajasika joy, which is derived
from the contact of senses with their objects. It is beyond our
"
777,"740 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
power, to obtain rajasika joy because it is beyond our power to
obtain individual's desired sense-objects. So, we are dependent
to obtain these, while there is no such dependence in attaining a
infinite bliss. That can be felt in the self by one's own self. In
attaining it you don't require any individual, any sense-object
and even your mind and senses. You are quite free in having
: it by your own self.
'‘Buddhigrahyam'—It means, that it is superior to the tamasika
joy, which arises from sleep, indolence and carelessness. A man
derives joy from sound sleep, but in sound sleep, his mind is
‘merged. Joy is also derived from indolence and heedlessness but
at that time mind is not awake and. discrimination is lost. But
in infinite bliss, the mind is not merged, nor is discrimination
lost. It is beyond the access of intellect, being an evolute of _
matter, while bliss, is the characteristic of the Self, which is
beyond matter. 7 -
Thus in this verse, it has been explained that the supreme ~
bliss, is far superior to the sattvika, rajasika and tamasika joy,
and it transcends all the three modes. | -
'Vetti yatra na caivayam sthitaScalati tattvatah'Y—A Yogi feels
bliss in his own self, and established there, he does not move
from reality viz., this bliss continues endlessly and spontaneously.
When, the muslims imprisoned Sivaji's son, Sarhnbhaj1, made him
blind and removed his skin off, to force him to embrace their
religion, but he did not do so and thus he did not go astray and
discard his religion. It means, that nothing can force a person
to move away from his beliefs. When no force, makes a person
to change his beliefs, how can anyone force a Yogi to deviate
from supreme bliss, or how can he himself abandon that supreme
bliss? He cannot.
It means, that a man never moves from Supreme Bliss,
because it is a characteristic of the Self (Soul). He changes only,
when there is the least affinity with matter. Thus, by affinity for
"
778,"Verse 21] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 741
matter, a man may have a fall, even from a trance. So long as,
he has affinity for matter, his self cannot merge, in the Cosmic
Self, because matter is always active. oo

Appendix—Having realized the self, a Dhyanayogi feels
imperishable and integral bliss which is atyantika (infinite) —
(supreme) viz., it is superior to Sattvika joy; ‘atindriyam’ viz.,
it is superior to Rajasika joy and ‘buddhigrahya’ viz., it is
superior to Tamasika joy.

When the Lord declares the imperishable bliss as
‘buddhigrahya’ He does not mean that it can be intuited (attained)
by intellect. The reason is that intellect is the evolute of Prakrti,
then how can it have an access to the bliss which transcends
Prakrti? Therefore the purpose in declaring it as ‘buddhigrahya’
is that it is superior to Tamasa joy. The joy, which is derived -
from sleep, indolence and carelessness, is Tamasa (Gita 18/39).
In sound sleep intellect merges in ignorance; and in indolence ;
and heedlessness, intellect does not remain fully awake. But -
in self-evident imperishable bliss, intellect does not merge in
ignorance but remains fully awake—jfanadipite’ (Gita 4/27). -
Therefore it has been called ‘buddhigrahya’ because intellect
remains awake but intellect has no access to it.

As in a mirror there is reflection of the sun, the sun is not —_
there, similarly in the intellect there is reflection of that bliss,
the bliss is not there; therefore it is called ‘buddhigrahya’.

It means that the integral bliss is far superior to Sattvika,
Rajasa and Tamasa joy, it transcends them. In spite of being
called as ‘buddhigrahya’, it totally transcends intellect.

The self associated with the intellect (Prakrti) is ‘buddhi-
grahya’, not the pure Self. In fact the self cannot be attached to
Prakrti but he (self) assumes his attachment to Prakrti—‘yayedarh
dharyate jagat’ (Gita 7/5). |

And, having gained which state he does not reckon any other
gain greater than that, and wherein established, he is not shaken
even by the greatest affliction. 22 :
Comment:—
""Yam labdhva caparam labham manyate nadhikam tatah'—
When a person, expects more happiness in something else, than
what he possesses, there is every possibility of his reverting -
to that. A man, wants to attain Supreme Bliss, or infinite |
bliss, and he runs after sleep, indolence and heedlessness, the -
*  tamasika joys. But he abandons these, because he feels that the
joy derived from the contact of the senses with their objects
is more pleasant than this one. He abandons it, also when he -
feels that Sattvika joy which is born by placidity of mind, by
meditation on God, is superior to it. He abandons it too, when
he feels, the Supreme Bliss. There is no greater bliss than this.
By gaining this, he has nothing else to seek, because there is
no gain, greater than this. ~
""Yasminsthito na duhkhena gurunapi vicalyate'—A man, may
also abandon something, if it results in affliction in spite of its
gain. A man, may abandon an attempt to achieve a goal, if he
feels that there is some danger. But here Lord Krsna, says that
a Yogi having been established in the Supreme Bliss, cannot
be shaken even by the greatest suffering. If he is hanged or his
limbs are broken to pieces, or his body, is ground to powder
between mill-stones or his skin is stripped off his body, or, his
body is put into boiling oil, yet he is not shaken.
"
780,"Verse 23] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 743
_ Why is he not shaken even by the greatest punishment? The
reason, is that a Yogi established in the Supreme Bliss, has no
body consciousness. So the harm inflicted on the body, does mn
not affect him. He feels pain or affliction, only if he identifies
himself with matter (Gita 13/21). But, when he by breaking off
his affinity, with matter, is established in the Supreme Bliss, of
the self, afflictions or sufferings cannot have any access to him,
and so he is not shaken even by the heaviest suffering. ,
Appendix—tThis verse is the touchstone for all disciplines.
A striver following any discipline—Karmayoga, Jnanayoga,
Dhyanayoga and Bhaktiyoga etc., should test himself on this
touchstone. In order to know his state this verse is very useful for
a Striver. Every being has an aim to wipe out sufferings and to
attain bliss. Therefore every striver should attain the state described -
in this verse. If this state has not been attained, it means that
his spiritual discipline has not attained perfection. A striver may :
not discontinue his practice or he may regard his imperfection -
as perfection, so this verse should be the criterion. )

A man can attain such a rare state—in which there 1s endless -
gain and there is not an iota of suffering but by indulging in |
accumulation and enjoyments he causes limitless harm to
himself.

'Tam vidyadduhkhasamyogaviyogarm yogasaijiitam'— Our
union with pain and birth is the result of accepting our affinity
with the world, and this affinity is merely assumed not real. We
can be delinked from this union, because it is merely assumed,
and is not natural. However, strong, our assumption may be,
and it may be for a long time, we can cut it asunder, as it is
impermanent. As soon as, we are disconnected from this union,
with pain (body and world) we attain Yoga i.e., we feel our union
with the Self, which is constant, eternal and spontaneous. But we
forget this latter union, because of our accepting affinity, with
the world. By breaking off this affinity, our memory is revived. —
Therefore, Arjuna in the seventy-third verse of the eighteenth _
chapter, says that he has regained his memory. It means, that _
Arjuna has not gained anything new, but he has regained his
memory, that he has a constant union with God (Self).

Here in this verse, Lord Krsna has defined Yoga, as -
disconnection of union with pain, while in 2/48, he has defined
it as equanimity in pleasure and pain. In fact, both, the definitions
are one and the same, because equanimity in pleasure and pain,
turns into a state of separation from union, with pain.

Patafijali has defined Yoga, as the control of mind
(Yogadarsana 1/2) and when the mind is controlled, one rests
in the Self (1/3). But in the Gita, Lord Krsna has defined Yoga,
as in this verse, one’s union with the self, which is axiomatic.

The term 'tam' (that), has been used for a state of a Yogi of
disciplined mind. This state has been hinted at, by the term ‘Yatra’
(where), in the first half of the twentieth verse of this chapter,
where it has been mentioned that the mind attains quietude. In
the second half of the twentieth verse, where it is mentioned
that a Yogi gets established in the self. In the first line of the
"
782,"Verse 23] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 745
twenty-first verse, He explained the importance of supreme bliss,
by using the term 'yat’ (which), while in the second line, by using
the term 'Yatra' (where), He explained the state of a Yogi. In CS
the twenty-second verse, He explained gain by the term ‘Yam’
(which), and 'yasmin' (in which). Thus, Lord Krsna by using the
term 'Yat'*, six times from the twentieth verse to the twenty- |
second verse, has explained the singular state of a Yogi. The
same state, has been glorified here, by the term ‘tam’ (that).
'Sa niScayena yoktavyo yogo'nirvinnacetasa'—This Yoga of
meditation, should be practised by a striver, by having the aim
of attaining Yoga (equanimity) with determination and with an
undistracted mind, as has been described from the eighteenth
verse to the twentieth verse of this chapter. In order to, realize
this state of equanimity, a striver should have a fixed mind, -
that he has to attain Yoga (equanimity), even in the face of all
temptations and afflictions. | -
'‘Anirvinnacetasa’ means, that a striver should not feel
despondent and distracted in attaining that Yoga, in spite of
obstacles and afflictions. He should think, that he has to realize -
God, perfection or equanimity even if, he has to spend years
and births together, and even if he has to face most serious |
afflictions. He should think, that he has wasted innumerable
births and suffered tortures in hell, but has not attained his aim
of God-realization, though his past sins have been destroyed. So,
he should devote his full time (span of his present life), power
and resources to, realize Him.
Appendix—The division of worldly union viz., Sarnyoga is
different from that of Yoga. There is ‘Sarnyoga’ with that object
(or person) or action with which we can’t stay forever and which
can’t stay with us forever. There is “Yoga’ with that with whom
we can stay forever and who can stay with us forever. Therefore
in the world there is ‘Sarhyoga’ with one another and with God
**Yatra', ""Yam' and ‘Yasmin’ are the words formed from the word 'Yat’. |
"
783,"746 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 6
there is yoga. In fact there is no union with the world and no
disunion from God viz., whatever we gain in the world is not
permanent hence it is no gain at all and God is never separate == = ~~ = —
from us. The assumption of the union with the world and disunion
from God is ignorance and it is the greatest blunder of a man.
Certainly there is disunion from the worldly union but there is
no disconnection at all from the union with God. |

A man wants union (with worldly things) but he has to
face disunion, therefore the world is said to be the abode of
sorrows—duhkhalayamasasvatam’ (Gita 8/15). A desire leads to
the union with pain (sufferings). If a striver is free from desires,
there is no union with sufferings and there is union with God.

The union of an embodied being with God is eternal.
This axiomatic eternal union is called ‘Yoga’. This eternal -
union prevails in all places, all the time, in all actions, in all ;

| things, in all persons, in all states, in all circumstances and in -

all incidents. It means that there has neither been, nor is, nor
will be nor can be any disunion from this eternal union. But by
assuming connection with the unreal (body) the eternal union
is not realized. As soon as there is separation (renunciation of
connection) from the assumed union with the unreal in the form
of pain, the eternal union is realized. This is the chief Yoga of
the Gita and in order to realize this yoga there is description
of Karmayoga, Jnanayoga, Dhyanayoga and Bhaktiyoga etc.
But these disciplines (paths) will be called “Yoga’ only when
there is total renunciation of affinity with the unreal and there
is realization of eternal union with God.

The Lord has defined Yoga in two ways—

(1) Equanimity is called Yoga—‘samatvath yoga ucyate’
(Gita 2/48). | |

(i) Termination of union with pain in the shape of the
worldly transmigration (travails of worldly life)—‘tarh vidyad-
duhkhasamyogaviyogam yogasanjiiitam’ (Gita 6/23).
"
784,"Verse 23] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 747

Fither call it equanimity or call it disconnection of union
with pain in the form of the world—both are one and the same.
It means that by getting established in equanimity, there will be _
disunion from the union with the world, and by the disunion
of the union with the world, a striver will get established in
equanimity. By anyone of these two, the eternal union with God
will be realized. If we see from the subtle point of view that ‘tarn
vidyadduhkhasamnyogaviyogarm yogasaiijiiitam’ is the first stage |
and ‘samatvarh yoga ucyate’ is the later stage in which there is
attainment of ‘naisthikisanti’ (everlasting peace), ‘paramasanti’
(supreme peace) or ‘atyantika sukha’ (eternal bliss).

Equanimity is being attained naturally and sufferings are
also disappearing naturally. Only that is attained who is ever
attained and only that is renounced which is ever renounced. The _
attainment of the ever attained is called Yoga and renunciation
of the ever renounced is also called yoga. The pleasures that are -
derived from the contact with sense-objects, persons and actions -
are only sources of pain viz., they cause sufferings (Gita 5/22).
Therefore union with the world rather than disunion causes -
sufferings. There is no disunion of the joy (bliss) which is
attained by disunion (renunciation of affinity) from the world
because it is eternal. When there is disunion in both union and
also disunion, it means that disunion is eternal. This eternal
disunion is called ‘Yoga’ in the Gita.

God being ever-existent is called ‘Is’ and the world being
never really existent is called ‘Not’. A vital fact is that while
we try to perceive ‘Is’ then pure ‘Is’ is not perceived but if we
observe ‘Not’ as negation, pure ‘Is’ to intuited. The reason is
that while we perceive ‘Is’ we make such perception through the
mind, intellect and other such ‘Vrttis’ then ‘Is’ to be perceived.
‘Is’ associated with such ‘Vrttis’, but while we perceive ‘Not’
then our ‘Vrttis’ themselves being ‘Not’ will be also shunned
and pure ‘Is’ will be intuited. As while removing rubbish, the
"
785,"748 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
broom is also discarded after removing rubbish as it is also
rubbish and the (clean) house remains. It means that ‘God
pervades everywhere’—by reflecting upon it with the mind and ---...=-
by. determining it with intellect, our connection with “Vrtti’ will
persist. But ‘the world is separating from us every moment’—thus
by perceiving the world as non-existent, our affinity with the
. world and the “Vrtti’ will be renounced and pure Supreme Reality
(God) will remain.

Completely giving up all desires arising from thoughts of the -
world, and restraining the senses, from all sides, by the mind. 24
Comment:— | |
[The state, which is attained by disinterested action (6/1—9),
is attained by meditation on God with attributes and form (6/14-15),
as by meditation on the self (6/18—23), is also attained by
meditation on the Absolute, Who is formless and attributeless,
which is described here. ] :
‘Sankalpaprabhavankamamstyaktva sarvanaSesatah'— Thoughts
of worldly things, persons and incidents etc., come to the mind,
when the man is either attached to or hateful for these and, it
becomes a 'Sankalpa’ (pursuit of the mind). This seed of pursuit,
sprouts and grows into a plant of desire. It should happen and it
should not happen—this is desire. Thus desire born of thought,
should be completely abandoned. :
"
786,"Verse 25] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 749
The term 'Kaman' (desires), which is itself plural, yet to
emphasize that all the desires of different kinds, should be
abandoned another term 'Sarvan' has also been given here. Te
'Asesatah' means, that the seed of desires should be completely
destroyed, otherwise it may sprout and grow into a forest of
desires stretching for miles and miles.
'Manasaivendriyagramar viniyamya samantatah'—Objects of
five senses—sound, touch, colour, taste and smell, should be
fully restrained by the mind. ‘Samantatah' means, that the mind |
also should not think of sensual pleasures, and in the mind there
should not be any temptation for worldly praise, honour and
comfort etc., in the least. One, who practises meditation should
resolve, to renounce affinity for all material objects. -
Appendix—First there is ‘Sphurana’ (mere flash of thought)
and then it is changed into ‘Sankalpa’ (pursuit of the mind). -
When we take ‘Sphurana’ as existent and get attached to it and ~
further we insist on its implementation then it changes into a
‘Sankalpa’. ‘Sphurana’ is like the glass of a mirror in which no -
photograph of a man its taken but ‘Sankalpa’ is like the film of
a camera which immediately catches the impression.

be done, to give up all desires and to restrain the senses.

One's intellect (mind) fixed firmly, he should gradually attain

"
787,"750 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
Comment:—

'‘Buddhya dhrtigrhitaya'—A striver, should not feel dejected
and disappointed, that he has not been successful, in meditationon -
God, after practising for a long time. He should have patience and
determination, that he has to attain God, whatever may happen,*
because there is no gain better than this. Thus, he should control
his intellect, without caring for worldly pleasures, praise, honour
and comfort etc.

'Sanaih sanairuparamed'—In being indifferent, to worldly
pleasures, he should not make haste, but he should become
indifferent gradually, and finally achieve quietude. He should
have neither attachment nor aversion, for pursuits of the mind. If
we abandon a thing there is a possibility of a feeling of aversion
persisting for it but there should not remain even a trace of the -
feeling of aversion for any object of the world. It is said that we
should become indifferent to it. Here, attainment of an attitude of
indifference has also been mentioned, because God, the sentient -
is beyond the access of mind, being as evolute of matter; which
is insentient. As a lamp, which receives light from the sun cannot -
illumine the ‘sun, so mind, which receives energy from God,
cannot have access to Him but can be indifferent to the world.
Secondly, in the world, there is nothing but affliction, therefore,
it is futile to think of the world. So, one should become quiet,
tranquil and indifferent.

‘Atmasamstham manah krtva'—God pervades everywhere,
even in thoughts, so thoughts are nothing, except God, who is
their base and illuminator. Secondly, God is eternal and always
the same, without any modification, while persons, things and
circumstances etc., are born and they decay viz., and have
no existence. So fixing the mind on God, and having a firm

* He should have an iron determination that he will not leave his seat without
realizing God even though his body may get parched and even his skin, flesh and
bones may decay.
"
788,"Verse 25} _. SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 751
determination of the existence of God, alone he should not
think at all. , , Ce
‘Na kificidapi cintayet'—It has already been said, that he
should not think of the world. God is all-pervasive, he should
also not think so. By that, his affinity with the mind, will persist.
A meditator, and the mind, will have their existence, so having
resolved, that God pervades everywhere, he should not think
of anything else. Thus by becoming tranquil, he will realize
the ever-existent self which has already been described in the
twenty-second verse. |
The most important fact, is that God (manifest or unmanifest),
pervades everywhere—in all persons, things, incidents, -
circumstances and actions and there is never any modification .
in Him, while matter always undergoes modifications. As a diver _ .
dives, into an ocean and perceives water all-around, similarly, a
striver, should feel God all-around and also, in him. The only -
aim of mankind, 1s to realize God, Who is ever realizable,
but He is not felt, because we divert our attention towards
perishable things. |
_ Jf we had an exclusive devotion to attain Him, our mind
would be automatically concentrated, on Him. Ether is around
us and so is God, but we do not pay attention to it. Therefore, a
striver abandoning all thoughts of the world, should be indifferent
and quiet. He, while concentrating his mind on God, commits
an error, that he opposes a thought that comes to the mind, and
then has affinity for it. Similarly, he has affinity for a thought,
if he is attached to it. Therefore, a striver should neither oppose
any thought nor support it, he should only remain indifferent
and attain tranquillity or quietude. |
All projections and distractions of the mind, are transient,
so if these are born, they would decay, certainly. We should not
"
789,"752: SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
accept our affinity for them. We should accept our affinity for
God, who pervades everywhere. When, we confine ourselves
to a body, our separate entity, comes into existence that, 'T am’. a
This individuality is also encompassed by God, who is limitless,
even, tranquil and also truth, knowledge and bliss as well as, the
illuminator of all things and actions. All objects and actions are
illumined by one light. This light, has a relation either with all
objects, actions and persons, or with none. This light, remains
as it is. Similarly, God as light, has no relation with objects and
actions etc., these objects and actions are transitory, while the
: Lord is without origin. Being established in Him, one should

not think of anything.

One, 'Cintana' (thinking), is done, while the other is automatic.
We should not resort to it (thinking). If some thought crops us, -
we should remain neutral and indifferent. An ice-cube (block
of ice), dropped into water is water, and is also: surrounded by
water. Similarly, all projections and distractions are within God, -
and God is in them.

Moreover, when a striver meditates upon, the memory past -
incidents etc., comes to mind, which have no current existence.
But, a striver by accepting their existence, strengthens them. So,
he should remain indifferent to them, without having attachment
or aversion. for them. They will perish, in the same way as, they
are born. We have a constant affinity, with God, we are His,
and He is ours. So, a striver by accepting the fact, that he is
always established in Him, should sit quietly without thinking of
anything else. He should not accept his affinity with a thought,
that comes to his mind itself. By doing so, the thought will
perish, and he will be fixed in God, because he always remains
fixed on Him.

Waves rise in a sea, but in water there is neither, sea nor
waves. Similarly in God, there is neither world nor thoughts. Only
He pervades, equally everywhere. Clouds appear and disappear
"
790,"Verse 25] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 753
in the sky, but the sky remains, the same. Similarly, while
meditating, thoughts come to mind and slip away while God
who is everywhere, remains the same. God is all-around, inside Te
as well as, outside. Everything, sentient or insentient, animate or
inanimate, 1s God Himself. He is both at hand and far away. He
is incomprehensible, because of His subtlety (Gita 13/15). He
is All Truth, All Knowledge and All Bliss. Everywhere, there
is bliss, bliss and only bliss.
While, discharging duties and performing actions, we should
accept that God is all-pervading and undivided. It will help us in
meditating, on God, while meditation on God will be helpful to us
in our practical life, viz., in remembering Him, when we perform
our duties. Therefore, a striver while meditating in seclusion or
performing actions in society, should always accept that God -
pervades everywhere, in all, the time, persons, things, incidents
and actions etc. So, we should always remain established in :
Him, without thinking of anything else. -
Appendix—The Discipline of Meditation is of two types—
(i) to concentrate the mind (ii) to renounce affinity for the mind ~
by discrimination. Renunciation of affinity by using discrimination
immediately leads to salvation. In the world so many virtuous
and sinful actions are done but we have no connection with
them, similarly we have no connection with the body, senses,
mind and intellect. This is known as ‘uparati’ (indifference). We
should have no connection with the ‘Vrtti’. In ‘Srimadbhagavata’
is mentioned— |
sarvam brahmatmakam tasya vidyaya’tmamanisaya
paripasyannuparamet sarvato muktasarisayah
(11/29/18)
The devotee who follows the above-mentioned discipline
(worship of God with all actions of mind, tongue (speech) and
body) has the determination, “AI] is God”. Then by this spiritual
knowledge, being free from all kinds of doubts, perceiving God
"
791,"754 -SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
pervading everywhere, he should become ‘uparama’ (indifferent)
viz., “All is God’—even this should not be thought of but God
should be seen face to face. | | 7 Ro

God as in the form of eternal-existence pervades all places,
time, actions, objects, states, circumstances, incidents etc., equally.
Places and time etc., have no existence but God ever exists. So
first a striver should have the determination with the mind: and
intellect “God exists’. Then he should give up this determination
also and be quiet viz., he should think of nothing. He should
think neither of the self nor of non-self, nor of God, nor of the
world, nor of union, nor of disunion. If he thinks of anything,
the matter (inert) will be thought of. The reason is that if he
thinks of anything, ‘Citta’ (mind) will accompany him. If an
instrument (Citta) accompanies him, the world will not be :
renounced because an instrument is also a part of the world.
Therefore in ‘na kifcidapi cintayet’ there is disconnection from
‘Citta’ (the instrument) because when an instrument is not with ~ |
him, then there will be real meditation. Even in the most subtle
reflection, “Vrtti’ persists. But when there is no reflection, the -
‘Vritti’ disappears. Therefore a striver should be indifferent to
reflection even. As, the soil mixed with water slowly settles down
naturally when the water is still, similarly all evils (flaws) by
keeping quiet slowly calm down naturally, ego melts and the
real self (the Reality) (free from egoism) is realized. |

Here the terms ‘Sanaih Sanaih’ have been used for giving up
“Vrtti’. By using the words ‘Sanaih Sanaih’ the Lord means to
say that the striver in order to be indifferent, should not apply
force, should not make haste because the impression gathered
through life after life, are not wiped out hastily. Haste makes
volatility firm and permanent but ‘Sanaih Sanaih’ (gradual effort)
destroys volatility.

Without connection with Prakrti, there can’t be any ‘cintana’,
‘manana’ (reflection) etc. If a striver thinks of the Supreme Reality,
"
792,"Verse 25] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI : 755

the mind will be used; if he determines, intellect will be used;

if he sees, the eyes will be used; if he hears, the ears will be

used and if he says anything, the tongue will be used. Similarly -
if he assumes ‘Is’, then assumption and he who assumes will

persist, and if he negates ‘not’, he who negates will remain.

If he renounces the sense of doership, “I am not a doer’ this

subtle ego will persist viz., by renunciation, the thing renounced

and he who renounces will remain. Therefore a striver should

become ‘uparama’ (indifferent) viz., he should neither assume

nor negate nor receive nor renounce but should accept the self

evident and natural Divinity and become quiet from within and

from without. ‘I have to keep quiet’—this insistence (pursuit of

the mind) should also not be maintained, otherwise he will have

the sense of doership. ‘Quietude’ is self-evident or automatic (it -
requires no initiative).

A striver should give up these four—‘I’, ‘thou (you)’, ‘this’ |
and ‘that’, and then only ‘Is’ (Reality) remains. He should accept —_
that self-evident ‘Is’ and should not think of anything. If a
thought comes to the mind, he should have neither attachment -
nor aversion to it, he should neither be pleased nor displeased
with it, he should consider it neither good nor bad nor he should
accept it in him. He should not think of anything but if a thought
crops up, that is not harmful. Air blows, sometimes it is hot,
sometimes cold, it rains—we are not to be blamed for these
occurrences because we have no connection with them. We are
blamed if we are connected with matter. Therefore if any thought
crops up, be indifferent to it, don’t get mixed with it viz., we
should not hold, “I think or ‘thinking’ is done in me.” But we
should hold, “Thoughts come to the mind and I (self) have no
connection with the mind.”

In the expression “atmasamstham manah krtva’ the term
‘manah’ stands for intellect because volatility is the trait of
mind and steadfastness is the trait of intellect. Therefore the :
"
793,"756 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
term ‘atmasarnstham’ means that instead of volatility, there
should be steadfastness. As “This is a particular village’—when
this assumption becomes firm, we have not to think of it again |
and again, similarly ‘God exists’—if this assumption is firmly oe |
rooted, then we’ll have not to think of His existence repeatedly. .
Therefore whatever is self-evident, what is the need to think of
it? So by thinking of the self, the self is not realized because
by thinking of the self, the thinker remains and existence of the
non-self persists. When we assume the existence of the non-self,
then we’ll renounce the none-self and think of the self.

‘Na kincidapi cintayet’—this is also known as ‘Cupa Sadhana’,
‘muka satsanga’, and ‘acintya ka dhyana’. In it there is neither
‘an action’ through the physical body nor there is ‘thinking’
through the subtle body nor ‘constancy’ (trarice) through the
causal body. In it senses are inactive, mind is also composed, -
intellect is also silent viz., there is no activity of the body, senses,
mind and intellect. All are silent, no one speaks. Whatever was _
to be seen, has been seen; whatever was to be heard, has been
heard, whatever was to be spoken, has been spoken; and whatever
had to be done, has been done; now there is no interest (taste) -
in seeing, hearing, speaking and doing etc.,—in such a state
‘Cupa Sadhana’ (silent discipline) is practised. This discipline
is superior even to trance because in it affinity for intellect
and ego is renounced. In ‘samadhi’ (trance), ‘laya’, ‘viksepa’,
‘kasaya’ and ‘rasasvada’—these four flaws (obstacles) persist
but ‘Cupa Sadhana’ is free from these flaws. “‘Cupa Sadhana’
(silent discipline) is devoid of Vrtti.

By whatever cause, the restless and unsteady mind wanders away, —
he should restrain it and continually concentrate it, on God.* 26
Comment:—
'Yato yato niscarati manaScaficalamasthiram _tatastato |
niyamyaitadatmanyeva vasam nayet'—Mind does not remain
steady, in the aim fixed by a striver. So it is called unsteady. It
thinks of worldly pleasures, and objects so it is called, restless. It
means, that it neither is fixed on God, nor renounces the world.
Therefore, a striver should restrain the mind from worldly objects
and thoughts, with discrimination, and place safely it at the feet
of the Lord. He should be cautious in subduing the fickle and
unsteady mind. He should, not be lax in it. It means, that a striver -
should understand, that the base and illuminator of those objects
and thoughts, is only God. This is concentration on God. -
(i) A striver, should restrain the mind when it is diverted to -
persons, things and circumstances etc., and concentrate it, again
and again, on God.
(ii) All the beings and things, in this universe are manifestations
of God. So he should understand, that whatever thought comes
to his mind, is nothing but God. Thus, he should concentrate
his mind, on God.
(111i) Mental rubbish stored inside the mind begins to come
out at the time of meditation, because when one was busy with
other activities, it could not find an outlet. By thinking thus, a
striver should not be perturbed. He should, rather continue his
efforts to concentrate, his mind.
this verse.
"
795,"758 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA __ [Chapter 6
| (iv) A striver cannot meditate on God, because he meditates
on Him, by accepting himself as of the world, while really he
is God's. Therefore, he should accept the reality, ""I am only
God's, and only God is mine. I am not of the body and the
world, and the body and the world, are not mine."" By accepting
affinity for God, which is a reality the mind will automatically
- . be concentrated on Him. : :
| (v) A striver, should not leave any part of work, pending. He
Should, either do the work first, or remove its thought from his
mind, and then start meditation on God, with a calm mind.
a (vi) He should do away with all pursuits and distractions of
_.the mind, by offering these as an oblation to the fire-god.
| (vii) He should, wink his eyes several times and then shut
these. By winking, as the outward scene is cut off, so are the _
pursuits and distractions of the mind, eliminated.
| (viii) He should exhale air forcibly from his lungs two or three
times, and then hold his breath as long as he can. Then, he should =~
| Start breathing slowly and come to a natural state of breathing.
By doing so, pursuits and distractions of the mind, disappear.
_ Appendix—lIf according to the preceding verse, a striver may
- not practise silent discipline, then he should restrain the mind
from worldly objects and thoughts, and concentrate it on God.
_ An excellent means to fix the mind on God is that wherever
the mind wanders, there he should perceive (see) God and
| whatever thoughts come to the mind, they should be regarded
as the manifestation of God.
: There is a vital point that so long as a striver assumes any
_ Other entity besides God, his mind cannot be totally restrained.
The reason is that so long as we recognize any other entity,
attachment can’t be totally wiped out and without total destruction
of attachment, mind can’t be totally controlled. If attachment
. persists, mind can be restrained to a certain extent by which
worldly ‘siddhis’—-accomplishments are achieved but Divinity
"
796,"Verse 27] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 759
is not attained. If any other entity is assumed, then the mind is
controlled for sometime and then there is deviation viz., there
are two states—trance and relapse. The reason is that without -
assuming the other entity, two states are not possible. Therefore
the mind can be totally restrained by assuming that there is no
any other entity besides God.

upaiti Santarajasam brahmabhiitamakalmasam
Great sattvika happiness, truly comes to the Yogi, whose mind -
is calm, whose passions are subdued, and who is without sin. 27
Comment:— | | .
'Prasantamanasam hyenam yoginam sukhamuttamam, upaiti
Santarajasam brahmabhitamakalmasam'—' Akalmasam' (sinless),
is he, who is free from tamas disposition, such as obtuseness,
inactivity, heedlessness and delusion (14/13). _
'Santarajasam' (whose passions are subdued), is he, whose
rajas propensities, of greed, activity, undertaking of actions with a
selfish motive, restlessness and a thirst for enjoyment, are subdued.
‘Prasantamanasam’ (one of peaceful mind), is he, whose mind,
becomes calm because he renounces all tamasika and rajasika
passions, and is free from mundane pursuits and distractions.
Here, the term 'Prasanta' means, that a Yogi, does not accept the
mind as his own and so his mind, becomes free from attachment
and aversion. Thus, his mind becomes calm, naturally.
‘Enam’ (this), has been used for the Yogi who attains
"
797,"760 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
tranquillity, as explained in the twenty-fifth verse. Such a Yogi,
attains sattvika happiness.
| In the second half of the twenty-third verse, the Lord offers an —
inspiration to practise the Yoga of meditation, with determination.
He, who practises this Yoga, verily attains sattvika happiness.
The term ‘hi’ used here denotes this certainty.
‘Sukhamupaiti'—It means, that a Yogi has not to make effort
to attain that Supreme Bliss, but it verily comes to him.

The sinless Yogi thus, submerging his self always in God, _
easily enjoys, the infinite bliss of oneness with the Brahma (the —
Absolute). 28
Comment:— _
- 'Yufijannevam sadatmanarh yogi vigatakalmasah'—Here the
_ term ""Yunjan’ does not mean, to fix the mind on God through
practice. It significies one's identity, with God. This identification
is not through mental pursuits. A Yogi constantly unites his self
with God, and thus becomes free from the feelings of egoism, |
and mineness. This freedom from mineness and egoism, means
freedom from sins, as affinity of egoism and mineness, with the
world is the root of sins. |
The phrase ""Yufijannevam’, in the fifteenth verse, has been
used for the Lord with attributes, while here it has been used
for the Absolute viz., the Lord without attributes. Similarly, in
the fifteenth verse, emphasis has been laid to fix the mind on
God, through practice, by the term 'Niyatamanasah’, while here
by the expression ""Vigatakalmasah', emphasis has been laid on
"
798,"Verse 29] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 761 :
renouncement of affinity, with, non-self. There, the mind by
meditating on God, is absorbed in Him and thus the world is
renounced, while here by renouncing affinity with the world, the ~
Yogi gets established in God. Thus, the result ot both, is the same. .
‘Sukhena brahmasamsparSamatyantam sukhamasnute'—In |
unity with God, the feeling of 'T’ does not exist, nor does there
remain its least impression. Infinite bliss 1s the state, in which a
Yogi is immersed in God, and loses his identity. A Yogi attains
this bliss, which has been named ‘Imperishable Bliss’ (5/21)
and ‘Supreme Bliss' (6/21), all these names denote the same,
Divine Bliss. an

The Yogi, whose mind is steeped in Yoga, looks on all with an
equal eye, sees his self present, in all beings and all beings mere
as appearance within his self. 29 |
Comment:— :
'Iksate yogayuktatmd sarvatra samadarsanah'—The Yogi sees
the same divinity in all. As toys made of sugar in the shape of
various birds, animals and men are of the same stuff, sugar; |
various arms and weapons of iron; various toys made of clay
and various ornaments of gold, likewise it is the self, that has
assumed various forms in the universe. So, a Yogi sees the self,
in all objects and beings.
'Yogayuktatma'—It means, that the mind of the Yogi,
by constant practice of meditation is absorbed in the self,
"
799,"762 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
and then his affinity, with the mind breaks off, which has
been indicated by the expression, ""Sarvabhitasthamatmanam
sarvabhutani catmani."" : _
- 'Sarvabhiitasthamatmanam'—As a worldly person, sees himself
in all his limbs, a Yogi, sees his self, in all the creatures. As
in a dream, different persons, animals and objects are a man's
Own creation, and they all disappear when he awakes, similarly
a Yogi, sees his own Self, in all beings because there is no
such existence of the world, as in a dream, it is transient and
kaleidoscopic. It means, that whatever he sees, is his Self.
‘Sarvabhitani catmani'—He sees all beings, as assumed in
the self. As different colours, are born of light and are seen only
in light, and as different objects born of the sun, are seen only
in the light of the sun; so does a Yogi, see that all beings are -
born of the self, merge in the self and are perceived, as assumed
ones, in the self. It means, that one sees the entire creation, as
a manifestation of the self, only. 7
In this verse, it is mentioned that a Yogi sees the Self
present in all beings, but it is not said that he sees all beings, —~
present in the Self. The reason is, that the Self exists in all
the creatures, but the creatures do not have their existence, in
the Self, because they are born and decay, while the Self ever
- remains the same. |
His dealings may differ, with different creatures, but he sees
all, with an equal eye, as he sees the same divinity, in all.

yo marh pagyati sarvatra sarvarh ca mayi pasyati |
tasyaham ha pranasyami sa ca me na pranasyati
He, who sees Me (the universal Self) present in all creatures, _ -
and sees all beings existing in Me, I am never out of sight for him, |
nor is he ever out of My sight. 30
Comment:—
'Yo mam pasyati sarvatra'—A devotee, sees Me in all
persons, animals, birds, gods, demons, things, incidents and
circumstances. When Brahmaji, stole cowherds and calves,
Lord Krsna Himself assumed the form of cowherds and calves
with their flutes, clothes and ornaments etc.* This drama of His —
manifestation, continued for one year, but nobody could know
it. One day, Balarama, the elder brother of Krsna, saw cows,
leaving their young calves who were left at home, run towards -
the big calves. Then, by intuition he realized, that Lord Krsna
had manifested Himself, as those calves. Thus, a devotee sees
God, pervading, everywhere. -
'‘Sarvam ca mayi pasyati'—He sees, all beings existing in
Me. As Lord Krsna shows Arjuna His divine form, He asks | :
him to behold the entire creation, both animate and inanimate |
in His one limb (11/7). Arjuna also says, ""O Lord, I behold in
Your body all gods and multitude of different beings"" (11/15).
Safijaya also says, ""Arjuna then saw the whole universe, with
its many divisions within His body"" (11/13). Thus, a devotee
sees the whole creation existing, in Him.
""Tasyaham na pranasyami'—-When a devotee sees everywhere
Me in each and every object, how can I be out of sight for him?
I always, remain within his sight.
* Lord Krsna assumed the forms of cowherds and cows, the same, in number,
bodies, limbs, sticks, horns, flutes, leaves, nets made of strings and the ornaments.
Their age, habits, nature, names, behaviour and states were all the same, as those
of original ones. At that time, the voice of the Vedas, that the whole is the form
of Lord Visnu, embodied itself (Srimadbha. 10/13/19).
"
801,"164 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
| 'Sa ca me na pranasyati'—When a devotee sees God

everywhere, God also sees him everywhere, because Lord Krsna
declares, ""However, men approach Me, so do I seek them (viz.,
carry out their desires)"" (Gita 4/11). It means, that when adevotee .
identifies himself with God, God in His Universal Self, sees him
everywhere. Thus, he is never out of His sight.

Now, a question arises, why Lord Krsna says, that the devotee
only is never out of His sight when He declares, that none is out
of my sight, ""I know the beings of the past, the present and the
future” (7/26). The answer is, that though none is out of sight
of the Lord, the Lord, sees him everywhere, who sees the Lord
everywhere. But, for those who have a disinclination for God,
and are attached to the world, He is not manifest (Gita 7/25).
Because of his disinclination for Him, he also remains out of
His sight, Lord Krsna declares, in the twenty-ninth verse of the
ninth chapter, ""I am equally present in all beings; there is none |
hateful or dear to Me. But they who worship Me with devotion, _ a
are in Me and I also am, in them."" |

Appendix—-In the preceding verse the Lord mentioned the soul __
(self) but now he mentions the Supreme Soul (God). A striver
following the discipline of meditation because of the past impression
of knowledge, has predominance of discrimination; while the other
striver, having the impression of devotion, has predominance
of faith and belief. Therefore the ‘Dhyanayogi’ with the latent
impression of knowledge discriminately sees the self present
in all beings ‘sarvabhiitasthamatmanarh sarvabhitani catmani’
(Gita 6/29). While the ‘Dhyanayog?’ having the latent impression
of devotion with faith and belief sees God everywhere—‘yo
mam paSsyati sarvatra sarvarh ca mayi pasyati’.

The expression ‘yo mam paSsyati sarvatra’ means that he
sees Me in others and also in himself. The expression “sarvam
ca mayi pasyati’ means that he sees others in Me and also sees
himself in Me. |
"
802,"Verse 31] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 765
As snow is lying everywhere, then how will it hide? If snow
is put behind that snow, then also snow will be seen. Similarly
when God manifests Himself in all forms, then how can He hide, -
where can He hide and behind whom can He hide? The reason
is that there is no other entity except God. In the supreme soul
(God) there is no division of the body and the self, the real and
the unreal, the insentient and the sentient, God and the world,
‘saguna’ (with attributes) and ‘nirguna’ (without attributes), ‘sakara’
(with form) and ‘nirakara’ (without form) etc. In Him only, there
are several divisions and in several divisions only He prevails.
He is not an object to be known by discrimination but He can
be known by faith and belief. Therefore “All is God”—a striver
should assume it, he should accept it with faith and belief. If he
accepts this truth firmly, he will realize the same truth.
A striver first sees God far away, then he sees Him nearby,
after it he sees Him in himself and finally he sees only God. A |
Karmayogi sees God nearby, a Jiianayogi sees Him in himself -
and a Bhaktiyogit sees God pervading everywhere.

Comment:—
'Ekatvamasthitah'—In the previous verse, Lord Krsna
explained that He is never out of sight of a devotee, nor is he
"
803,"766 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
ever out of sight of Him. Why? Because a devotee identifies
himself with God, who abides in all beings viz.,. he develops |
intense love, for Him. | oo :

In accordance with non-dualistic principle, a devotee has no
identity of his own, his identity is merged in the Lord, while, in
dualistic tenets. the Lord and the devotee assume separate entities
outwardly, though inwardly they are one and the same* just as
a husband and a wife possessing two different bodies regard,
themselves as one, and so two friends, who deem themselves
as one. Due to intense love, duality does not exist. A devotee,
who worships God, with wholehearted devotion, gets established
in communion with Him. This oneness and the sameness of a
devotee and God, is called 'Ekatvamasthitah’.

'Sarvabhiitasthitarh yo marn bhajati'—God pervades everywhere -
in all persons, things, incidents and circumstances etc., viz., all
is God, He puts on the appearance of the entire phenomenon,
(7/19)—this is his worship, to God. | | -

'Sarvabhiitasthitam'—By this phrase, it seems as if God abides

only in beings, but actually it is not so, He abides, in each and -
every particle of the universe. In ornaments made of gold there
is nothing, but gold. When ornaments were not made, there was |
gold, even now gold exists in them and there will remain gold
even when the ornaments are broken or spoiled. But, it does not
mean that there is gold only in those ornaments, not anywhere
else. Similarly, God existed, before the creation of the world,
He exists now, and He will exist at the end of the creation. But,
to explain the fact that all beings are just like ornaments, and
God is like gold, it is said that only God abides, in all beings
and He also abides, at all places. : |

*In the Discipline of Knowledge the devotee identifies himself with God
and loses his identity, while in the Discipline of Devotion to exchange and
enhance true (spiritual) love, the Lord and the devotee like Sri Krsna and

: Radhaji, being one and the same become two. a 7
"
804,"Verse 31] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 767
'Sarvatha vartamano'pi sa yogi mayi vartate'—He, while
discharging his duties, according to the ordinance of the scriptures
abides in Me, because in his view there is no independent entity,
except Me. 7 | a | -
In the. thirteenth chapter, in the context of the Discipline of
Knowledge, Lord Krsna announced, ""Even though engaged in
all sorts of activities, he is not born again"" (13/23);. while here,
He says, ""Though engaged in all sorts of activities, he dwells in
Me."" 'He is not born again,’ means that. he is emancipated, 'He
dwells in Me' means, that the devotee, by becoming one with
God, has a unique relish of spiritual love, which is infinite and
which ever enhances. _ :
_ Here, Lord Krsna says, that that devotee-dwells in Him.
Here a question arises, whether other creatures don't dwell in _
Him. The answer is, that all creatures dwell in Him, but by |
attaching importance to the world, they neither know, nor accept .
that they dwell in Him. They, because of egoism and mineness, -
uphold this universe (Gita 7/5). They don't regard the world,
as manifestation of God, but regard it as a separate entity and _
attach importance to it by declaring, 'We are worldly people,’
while a devotee realizes, that it is God Who manifests Himself,
as multitudinous beings viz., so all is God, and so a devotee
always dwells in Him. : | |
Appendix—A devotee sees the entire universe as the
manifestation of God. From his view-point besides God no
other entity exists. For him the seer (onlooker), the seen and
‘that act of seeing’—all the three are only the manifestation
of God—‘Vasudevah sarvam’ (Gita 7/19). As the Ganges is
worshipped with the water of the-Ganges, similarly.a devotee’s
all dealings are focussed on God. As a person who has identified
himself with the body, while performing all actions, dwells in
the body, similarly such a devotee while discharging his duties,
abides in God. | |
"
805,"768 _SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6 |
In the thirteenth chapter the Lord declares—‘sarvatha
vartamano’pi na sa bhiiyo’bhijayate’ (13/23)+-a Jiianayogi.
performing duties in everyway is not born again and here he
_ declares for a devotee ‘sarvatha vartamano’ pi sa yogi mayi vartate’ -
viz., ‘a devotee engaged in all forms of activities; dwells in
Me’. It means that by the path of knowledge a striver is freed
from the cycle of birth and death and he attains salvation; but
by the path of devotion, he is freed from. the cycle of birth and
death, attains oneness with God and develops intimate kinship
with Him. The same idea has been expressed in the Gita in
the following ways—‘tasyaham na pranasyami sa ca me na
pranasyati’ (6/30), ‘priyo hi jianino’tyarthamahamh sa ca mama
priyah’ (7/17), ‘jiani tvatmaiva me matam’ (7/18), ‘ye bhajanti
tu marn bhaktya mayi te tesu capyaham’ (9/29). In the Discipline
of knowledge because of the presence of an iota (trace) of subtle -
ego there can be philosophical differences but in the Discipline
of Devotion because of oneness with God, not even an iota of
subtle ego and the philosophical differences caused by that ego 7
remain. In ‘na sa bhiyo’bhijayate’ a striver having realized the
self gets established in the self, the self. remains, while in ‘sa -
yogi mayi vartate’ only God remains, the Yogi does not remain
as a Yogi but he becomes an embodiment of God.

and attributes).

[What has been mentioned, as ‘Identified with Brahma (the
Absolute)’ or ‘Attainment of Infinite Bliss', in the twenty-seventh
and twenty-eighth verses respectively, in this verse, Lord Krsna
explains the behaviour of such an enlightened Yogi towards |
others. ""Such a Yogi is devoted to the welfare of all beings""
(5/25, 12/4).] | oe
'Atmaupamyena sarvatra samam pagyati yo'rjuna'—An ordinary
person, regards the injury of any of his limbs as his own, because
according to him he and his limbs are one and the same. But a
Yogi regards others as his own Self and thinks of their harm as
his own harm. If any afflicted person comes before him then that -
Yogi tries to alleviate the suffering of that man in the same way
as he attempts to alleviate the suffering of any limb of his own
body. Meaning thereby that as an ordinary man is engaged in -
providing comfort to his body. So too the Yogi is automatically
engaged in making others happy. _ | -
‘Sarvatra' (everywhere), means that he is engaged in promoting
the welfare, of all beings without any distinction of caste, creed
and colour and does good, even to animals, birds, trees and
plants etc. By him, efforts are automatically made to alleviate,
their suffering. ©
He knows, that limbs have different shapes and functions,
yet he makes efforts to soothe the afflicted limbs, equally. Hands
cannot be used, as feet. If by chance, a hand is touched by another
hand, we do not wash it. But, if it touches a foot, it is to be
washed. When an organ of excretion is cleaned by a hand, we
wash the hand, with clay. Thus, one observes, touchability arid
untouchability with others, also in accordance with the ordinance
of scriptures. But, it does not mean, that he hates them. He loves
all of them and does good to them, as he does to his own limbs. _
"
807,"770 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
‘Sukham va yadi va duhkham’'—To feel happy and sad, on the
analogy of his body does not mean, that if a person is injured, this
enlightened soul, feels that injury in his body. If it were taken as _
such, the affliction of the enlightened soul, would be enormous,
because the world is full of afflicted persons. It means, that as
an ordinary and ignorant person attached to his body, makes
efforts to relieve bodily pain promptly, an enlightened: soul does
the same, to others; and as an ignorant man is not proud of such
actions performed for his body, an enlightened one is also not
proud of performing these for others. He is naturally engrossed
in the welfare of others. Moreover, an enlightened soul, can bear
his bodily pain and remain indifferent to it, but he cannot bear
the pain of others, and so always remains prepared to relieve
their suffering. So he thinks that he has the power to bear the
pain, as he knows that he himself is different from his body, -
while the ignorant people have no power to bear the pain, as |
they identify themselves with their bodies. Indra, the king of the _
gods, beheaded sage Dadhici—though the latter had caused no
offence to the former. Dadhici was brought to life, by Aévini-
kumaras, the twin sons of the sun who are supposed to be the -
physicians of the gods. But, when Indra demanded bones of
Dadhici, to make a thunderbolt, Dadhici offered him his bones,
by abandoning his body. | :
: Here a question arises, that an enlightened soul, is prepared
to remove the pain of others, while he shows indifference to his
own bodily pain, and suggests it, that he lacks equanimity. The
answer is, that this attitude is superior to equanimity, because it
becomes his nature, without having the least unevenness of mind.
‘Sa yogi paramo matah'—-That Yogi, is regarded as supreme,
because he sees nothing but God pervading everywhere, all the
time and remains established in union with Him.
(i) For a Yogi of meditation, it has been said, ""He looks
"
808,"Verse 32] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 771
on all as one, on the analogy of his own self."" For a Yogt of
Discipline of Action, it has been said, ""He identifies his self,
with the self of all beings"" (5/7). For a Yogi of the Discipline _
of Knowledge, it has been.said, ""He is devoted to the welfare of .
all"" (5/25, 12/4). But in the Discipline of Devotion, a devotee sees
the Lord (the universal self). present, in all beings (6/30) and he
worships Him through the performance of his own duty (18/46).
It means, that a striver, following the Discipline of Action as
well as Knowledge, should see his own self in all beings, while
a striver following the Discipline of Devotion, should see the
Lord, his beloved Deity, present in all beings.
_ . (ai) A feeling of brotherhood is an excellent one. But, when
self, interest comes in, as In the case of the Kauravas and Pandavas,
this feeling of brotherhood changes into enmity. But he who |
looks on all alike, on the analogy of his own body, cannot have
feelings of enmity, for anyone. For example, no one gets angry
with the teeth or pulls them out, if they accidently happen to -
bite the tongue or lips. Similarly, an enlightened Yogi, has no
enmity for anyone, he takes joys and sorrows of others, as his -
own. Superior to this feeling, is one that God is present in all
beings. Thus a devotee sees his favourite Lord, everywhere. So,
Lord Krsna declares him to be superior to others. He says, ""He
is considered by Me to be, the best Yogi"" (6/47), ""I consider
them to be the best Yogis"" (12/2), ""Those devotees are extremely |
dear, to Me"" (12/20) and so on. os OO
Appendix—-A common man sees the self in the body. He
does not want pain in any organ, does not have aversion to any
organ but regards all the organs as his own equally. Similarly
a devotee beholds God in all beings and tries to alleviate their
sufferings and-to comfort them equally. He regards the objects,
ability and power etc., not as his own but as God’s. As the.
Ganges is worshipped with the water of the Ganges and the sun
is worshipped with an earthen lamp, similarly a devotee offers
"
809,"772 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA _ [Chapter 6
the Lord’s things in rendering service to Him—‘tvadtyarh vastu
govinda tubhyameva samarpaye’.

As having proper dealings with different organs of the body, -
a common man regards them as the self and tries to alleviate
their pain and to comfort them equally. Similarly according to
the saying ‘as a deity, so the worship’, dealings with a Brahmana
and a pariah, with a sage and a butcher, with a cow and a dog
will be different according to the ordinance of the scriptures
but the devotee beholds God in all of them and so he tries to
alleviate their sufferings and to comfort them equally without
any distinction. :

As a devotee assumes the identity of God with the soul of
all beings (Gita 6/31), similarly he assumes the identity of all
bodies with his own body. Therefore he feels happy with the _
happiness of others and sad with the sadness of others—‘para
dukha dukha, sukha sukha dekhe para’ (Manasa; Uttara. 38/1).
He like the joys and sorrows of his own body, takes the joys and -
sorrows of others as his own. “To feel sad with the sadness of
others’ means to make efforts to alleviate the sorrows of others, .
rather than to become sad seeing them sad, similarly in order to
be happy himself, he has not to alleviate the sorrows of others,
but being compassionate he has to make efforts to make others
happy. It means that he has not to enjoy happiness himself but
he has to feel happy by seeing that the other person has got rid
of sorrows and has become happy. a

There is so much difference between the eyes and the feet
that we see with eyes and we walk with feet, the eye 1s the sense
of perception while the foot is the. organ of action. In spite of
so much difference, there is so much identity that a thorn runs
into the foot and the eyes are filled with tears; dust falls into
the eyes and the feet totter. It means that we can’t separate the
body from the world and can’t separate the world from the body.
Therefore if we take care of own body, similarly we should
"
810,"Verse 33] - SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 773
take care of the world; and if we are indifferent to the world,
we should be indifferent to our body. Accept anyone of these
two—this is honesty. _ -
Link:—Lord Krsna explained the Discipline of Meditation,
as a means to attain equanimity, from the tenth verse to the |
thirty-second verse. A doubt arises in Arjuna's mind, and he
puts it before Lord Krsna, in the next two verses.

Arjuna said:
O Krsna, this Yoga of equanimity has been preached by You -
but I do not perceive its stability, due to restlessness of mind. 33
Comment:—
[Lord Krsna, in the gospel of Gita, has laid great emphasis
on equanimity, in success and failure etc. This equanimity, leads
a man to salvation. Arjuna was afraid of sins by waging war. So
Lord Krsna, exhorted him, ""Treating alike pleasure and pain, gain
and loss, victory and defeat, engage yourself in the battle. Thus
you will incur no sin"" (2/38). In this world, people incur so many
sins, but we are not held responsible for these, because we are
equanimous. Similarly, while performing actions and discharging
our duty, if we remain equanimous, those actions do not lead us
to bondage. Therefore, Lord Krsna in the beginning of this chapter
said, ""He who discharges his duty, without expecting the fruit
of actions, is a Sannyasi and.a Yogi."" The result of renouncing
"
811,"774 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
the fruit of actions is equanimity. Lord Krsna described,: the
Discipline of Meditation, as a means of attaining equanimity, from
the tenth to the thirty-second verses. Keeping this equanimity in
mind Arjuna puts forth his doubt before Lord Krsna.]
""Yo'yam yogastvaya proktah sAamyena madhusiidana'—Here
the doubt which Arjuna conveys to, Lord Krsna, is not about
the thirty-second verse, but about meditation, because in the
thirty-second verse there is reference to an enlightened soul who
is always equanimous. Therefore, here the word Yah’ (which)
denotes, Yoga (equanimity) and 'Ayam' (this).denotes meditation,
detailed from the tenth verse to the twenty-eighth verse.
'Etasyaham na pasyami caiicalatvatsthitim sthirim'—Here,
Arjuna seems to mean, that equanimity can be easily attained,
by the Discipline of Action, but it 1s difficult by the Discipline
of Meditation, owing to restlessness of mind. |
It means, that a striver cannot concentrate his mind on God,
so long as the mind is restless, and without concentration of -
mind, equanimity cannot be attained.

'Caficalam hi manah krsna pramathi balavaddrdham'—Ayjuna
addresses the Lord as Krsna, because He has the power of
"
812,"Verse 34] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 775
attraction. So, He should attract his mind and concentrate it on —
Him, because it is very difficult for him to control it, as it is
unsteady and restless. Besides being restless, it is turbulent, it -
distracts a striver from the right course. Moreover, it is obstinate
and strong. | |
According to Lord Krsna, ""Desire has five locals:—the
senses, mind, intellect, sense-objects and self"" (Gita 3/40, 3/34,
2/59). Actually desire (Kama) vests, in the embodied Self, but
it seems to reside, in senses, mind and intellect etc. Unless it is
removed from the self, it appears in the senses and mind etc.,
from time’ to time. But, when it is destroyed from the self, it
does not appear anywhere. This proves, that so long.as desire
subsists.in the self, the mind torments a striver. Therefore, the
mind has been called turbulent. Similarly, the senses torment the _
mind, of a striver. So, the mind has been called turbulent, in the
sixtieth verse of the second chapter. It means that when desire |
appears in the mind and senses, it torments the striver and does -
not allow him to remain established, in the self. —
Because of the desire inhering in the self the mind is attracted -
intensely towards objects etc., and does not abandon them, in
anyway. So it is called obstinate. This obstinacy of the mind is
very strong, and so the mind is called strong. It forcibly distracts
a striver, from his course and leads him to sensual pleasures.
So it has. been mentioned in scriptures, ""Mind leads a man to
emancipation, and bondage.” But the mind, remains turbulent,
obstinate and strong, so long as desire rests, in the self. When
a striver himself, becomes free from desires, objects and senses
do not affect him at all, and turbulence, obstinacy and strength
of the mind, perish. . | | ce :
Restlessness of the mind, is an obstacle so long as, desire
resides in the self. But when desire is rooted out, it is not an
obstacle in the least. It is mentioned in the scriptures—
""When the feeling of egoism (T'ness with matter) 1s rooted
"
813,"716 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
out, and one realizes God, one's mind perceives God, everywhere
_ viz., one attains by constant trance (natural trance)."""" ~~
‘Tasya'‘ham nigrahamm manye vayoriva suduskaram'—It is
difficult to control, this restless, turbulent, strong and obstinate
mind. As one cannot catch hold of wind, in the same way, mind
cannot-be controlled easily, it is very difficult to control it. —
Appendix—The Lord in the twenty-ninth verse mentioned
the experience of the striver who meditates on the self, while
from the thirtieth to the thirty-second verses he mentioned the
experience of the striver who meditates on God endowed with
attributes and form. In these verses the Lord means that the final
result of the discipline of meditation is to see the self or to see
God in all. The Dhyanayogi, having the impression (latency) of
knowledge, sees the self in all; while the Dhyadnayogi, having -
the impression of devotion, sees God in all. To see the. self
in all is ‘atmajfiana’ (Self-realization) and to see God in all is
‘God-realization’. In Self-realization there is predominance of —
discrimination, in God-realization there is predominance of belief
and faith, not the predominance of the steadiness of mind. But -
in Arjuna’s mind the impression of the discipline of meditation
mentioned from the tenth to the twenty-eighth verses was lingering.
Therefore he regarded fickleness of the mind as an obstacle to
Self-realization or to God-realization. He did’nt pay attention
towards the impression of knowledge or devotion but he thought
of the volatility of mind. Therefore he thought that volatility
of mind was the obstacle to Self-realization or God-realization.

demanded a boon of adversity, from Lord Krsna.* Such cases are _
rare in history. So Lord Krsna, wants to remind Arjuna, that he
is the son of such a dispassionate mother. Being dispassionate,
he should concentrate his mind, on God. -

An earnest, regular and persistent attempt, te concentrate the
mind on God, is called practice. This practice should be done
with respect and adoration, for God by attaching importance to |
Him. This practice is of two kinds:— :

(i) A striver should concentrate his mind on the target and
being indifferent to thoughts, that come to mind.

(1) A striver, should concentrate on his deity, wherever the
mind wanders. |

There are some other ways also, of concentrating the mind
on God.

* OQ preceptor of the world, grant us adversity so that we may have your rare
vision which may enable us not to be reborn.

- oo , (Srimadbha. 1/8/25)
"

(1) A striver should exhale air two or three times, and
then think that he has discarded the world of his mind, and so
whatever thoughts will come to mind, will be a manifestation _
of God only—this is ‘Vasudevah sarvam'’. oe .
- (2) Recite the name of the Lord, and listen to it. There
should not be any time-lag between the recitation of one name,
and the next. - oS
(3) Recite Gods name and :count,the number through the
mind, without using fingers or a rosary of beads, to count.
(4) Recite, one, name of the Lord, as ‘Rama’ (with the voice)
and remember another name, as ‘Krsna’ (within the mind). |
-(5) Chant the name within the mind. __ a
(6) Think of a form of the Lord, from top to toe and from
toe to top. ; | | | -
(7) Think that the Lord is standing before you. Think of His
form. Write mentally, on His toes, five names, on the lower part _
of the leg, three names, a little above it, two names, a little above
it three names, below and above the knee, one name each, on |
the thigh, three names, on the righthand side of the waist, two
names, on the rib, three names, on the shoulder, two names, on
_ the upper part of the arm, three names, above and below the
elbow, two names in the form of a ring, on the five fingers five
names, round’ the throat, four names as half of a garland, in the
ear, two names as an earring, on the righthand side of the crown,
six names, by making three rings. ys
Thus, by writing fifty-four names, on the righthand side and
fifty-four names on the lefthand side, we think of all the limbs
of the Lord and count the. hundred and eight beads of: a rosary.
We can do this once or twice a day. _ ——
Thus, there. are different methods of concentrating ones mind
on God. A striver can also think of other means himself.
This practice of concentration,.needs dispassion because the
"
816,"Verse 36] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 779
more dispassionate a man is, the easier it will be for him to
concentrate his mind, on God. If he has no attachment for the
world, he will not think of the world. If a thought, because of /
past influences, comes to his mind, he should become indifferent
to it, without having any attachment or aversion. By doing so,
the thought perishes. Thus by practice and dispassion, a mind
can be controlled. a a |
The Methods to Develop Dispassion
1. The world is kaleidoscopic, while the self never changes,
in the least. We cannot live with the world and the world cannot
live with us. Our babyhood, boyhood and youth, have passed.
Similar, is the case with circumstances. By thinking of reality,
we can become dispassionate.
2. We should satisfy, the just desires of our family and
relations, according to our power, ability and resources, without
hope of reward. Thus, old attachment is wiped out, and new -
attachment is not born. | |
_ 3. We should think that all sins, crimes and pains, are the .
fruits of attachment, while peace and bliss, are the fruits of
dispassion. By thinking so, we can develop dispassion.

subdued but it can easily be achieved by him, who has controlled |
"
817,"780 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA | [Chapter 6
his mind and who strives ceaselessly; such is My conviction. 36
Comment:—

‘Asathyatatmana yogo dusprapa'—It is my opinion, that Yoga = -
is hard to attain, for one whose mind is not subdued, because
restlessness of mind is not such a great obstacle, to attain Yoga
as is the uncontrolled mind. As a chaste wife controls her mind
but she does not concentrate. So too, a striver should control .
his mind. By controlling. the mind, a striver, can concentrate
on God.

Generally, strivers have a tendency to be engaged in spiritual
discipline with faith, but they do not make persistent efforts,
with the result, that their mind and senses, are not controlled
and thus Yoga is difficult to attain. That is why even ever and
everywhere present God is not easily attained. _

Strivers have no disinclination for pleasures, as they have
for the forbidden food, such as meat etc. Eating forbidden
food, causes degradation. But enjoyment of sense-objects with ~
attachment, causes much more degradation. In eating meat,
Strivers have a notion, that this 1s a prohibited item, but while -
enjoying sense-objects, they do not have this thought. Worldly
pleasures leave their influence, which continues for ages and
which induces them to incur sins. Due to this inclination for
pleasures, they are unable to control their mind and senses, and
so they find it difficult to attain Yoga. |

'VaSyatmana tu yatata Sakyo' vaptumupayatah'— Yoga can be
attained, by him who has controlled his mind and who strives 7
ceaselessly viz., one who is regulated in diet and recreation,
sleep and wakefulness—such is My conviction. |

A striver, who wants to control his mind, should understand
that he is a devotee and a striver, not sensual, he is God's and
so, he should take refuge in Him; he is a seeker after knowledge,
and so he should obtain it; he is a servant and so he has to serve
others, without having any desire. Thus, if a striver changes his
"
818,"Verse 36] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 781
ego, (‘I'ness), the mind can easily be and quickly, controlled.

When mind is purified, it is controlled spontaneously.
Attachment of mind for the perishable, is its impurity. When the :
striver has an exclusive aim, of God-realization, his attachment
is renounced, and his mind becomes pure. |

A striver should always be careful, he should never have, a_
claim on others’ things etc., because by laying such a claim his
mind becomes impure. In business, service or other transactions,
he should never adopt foul means, he should never try to take
the share of others, but he should give a part of his own share,
to them. By doing so, his mind is purified.

In the Discipline of Meditation, Arjuna said, ""Mind is restless, _
therefore, I consider it as difficult to control, as the wind."" In
response to this problem Lord Krsna, offered a solution, by
saying, ""It can be controlled by practice and dispassion."" Out 7
of these two, for meditation, practice is more significant (Gita
6/26), while in the Discipline of Knowledge, dispassion is more ~
important. Though dispassion is helpful, in the Discipline of
Meditation, yet in this discipline, mind can be controlled, even
when attachment persists. According to the philosophy of Patafijali,
one's mind can be controlled by practice. If dispassion is the
cause of concentration, how can one gain accomplishments, or
worldly fruits, by the concentration of mind? How concentration ,
of mind could result in getting occult powers or worldly fruits
unless one had a desire for them. If these were obtained as a
result of concentration of mind, it proves that concentration can
be had with desires subsisting in the mind. But when the aim
is to realize God, concentration of the mind and a trance, are
helpful in God-realization.

The next stage, after concentration of the mind, is trance.

There is a minor deviation from the state of trance also. It means,
"
819,"782 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 6
that in that state there lingers affinity for matter. When this
affinity breaks off, a striver realizes the Self, from where there
is no deviation. Lord Krsna, in the gospel of Gita, did not talk
much, about the concentration of the mind, because it was not His
aim. Concentration of mind according to Him, is only a means |
_ to achieve an end, either mundane or spiritual, while attachment
for the world, is the main obstacle to God-realization. Therefore,
a striver should renounce his affinity for matter. First, a striver
may have attraction for a trance, but when he attains a state of
trance, he has no attraction for it, he becomes indifferent, to
: it. As soon as, he becomes indifferent to it, he gets established
in the self, which is called the attainment of Yoga. This Yoga,
(unity), is constant and eternal. :
Appendix—In fact in order to attain perfection by the discipline
of meditation, restraint of the mind is not so necessary as is its 7
purification. ‘Purification of the mind’ means not to be attached to
the sense-objects.. He who has purified his mind, attains perfection _
by the discipline of meditation by making efforts.
Whatever the Lord said in the thirty-first verse by the :
: expression ‘sarvabhitasthitarh yo mam bhajatyekatvamasthitah’
in that. the main obstacle is not to behold God in all beings and
everywhere; and whatever the Lord declared in the thirty-second
verse by the expression “atmaupamyena sarvatra sama pasyati
yo rjuna’—the main obstacle is attachment and aversion. But
Arjuna by an error thought the volatility of mind as an obstacle.
In fact. volatility of mind is ‘not an obstacle but not to behold
God in all beings and everywhere’ and ‘attachment-aversion’ are
obstacles. So long as attachment and aversion persist, a striver
can’t behold God in all beings and everywhere and as long as
he does not behold God in all beings and everywhere viz., he __
_ has the assumption of any other entity besides God, the mind
| can’t be totally restrained. |
_ When a. ‘Vrtti’ is restrained, it means that there is existence
"
820,"Verse 37] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI | 783
of the “Vrtti’. Because we accept its existence that is why we
think restraining it. In the self there is no ‘Vrtti’. Therefore if
we restrain the “Vrtti’ the mind will be restrained for sometime -
and again there will be relapse (deviation). If we don’t assume
any other entity besides God, then there is no question of relapse. -
The reason is that if there is no other entity, there is no question
at “all of the existence of mind even. © 7 | |

By addressing the Lord as Krsna, Arjuna means to say, that
He who attracts all creatures is the controller of their destiny.
Therefore, he asks Him in which direction, he will attract him
and what fate he will meet with. - )

Appendix—In ‘karanasapeksa’ discipline (discipline dependent
On instruments), a striver with mind, gets established in the 7
self—‘yada viniyatarh cittamatmanye vavatisthate’ (Gita 6/18).
Therefore by having connection with the mind, his mind deviates -
and so there is possibility of his falling from yoga. When a
striver regards ‘karana’ (instruments) as his own, then he practises .
‘karanasapeksa’ discipline (discipline dependent on instruments). ""
A Dhyanayogi by regarding the mind (Karana) as his own
concentrates it on God. By fixing the mind, he falls from Yoga.
Therefore the reason for his falling (deviating) from Yoga is
dependence on instruments. This ‘karanasapeksata’ (dependence on
instruments) is not required in the three disciplines—Karmayoga,
Jnanayoga and Bhaktiyoga. |

A Dhydnayogi is reborn because of the deviation of the
mind viz., by falling from His discipline; but a Karmayogi or a
Jiianayogi is reborn because of the worldly attachment.

In Bhaktiyoga there is dependence on God, so He provides
special protection to his devotee—’ yogaksemarn vahamyaham’ (Gita
9/22), ‘maccittah sarvadurgani matprasadattarisyasi’ (Gita 18/58).

_ ‘Apratistho mahabaho vimidho brahmanah pathi'—He

as rain, is separated from the main body and cannot join the
other parts. Thus it is shattered. In similar the fate of a striver
who renounces his dependence on the world, but at the same
time fails to realize God? Does he meet with damnation?
Here, the illustration of a cloud is not quite apt, because
a part of a cloud and the main body of clouds and the part to
which it was going to rejoin—all the three belong to the same
class, they are matter. But in the case of a striver, the world is
matter (insentient), while he himself and God, are sentient. Thus
they do not belong, to the same category.
In this verse, Arjuna means to say, that the soul being a
- fragment of God, is imperishable. If it has the aim to attain heaven,
it might have gone to heaven or hell or the other lower births
"
823,"786 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
of beasts and birds, but still would have remained in the world.
What is the fate of a striver, who has renounced dependence on
the world with the aim of attaining God, but could not realize :
the same and at the time of death, could not think of God?
| An Exceptional Fact | 2

Here failing in both does not mean that he has fallen from Yoga
as well as God-realization. A striver cannot have a downfall, if
he has attained God-realization. Here the iilustration of a cloud,
with a part separated from the main body and not joining the other
clouds and is scattered in between the two, is not very apt, as
a striver, who has not yet realized. God cannot be said, to have
fallen from God-realization. Moreover, once God-realization is
attained, there is no question of being detached from it. Thus, if =|
a person fails to think of God at the last moment, he may be said
to have failed in attaining God, but he cannot be said to have
failed in both i.e., Yoga and God-realization. Therefore fallen = -
from both here means that he is deprived of both God-realization
and worldly enjoyments. Arjuna has also dwelt upon the same 7
point, in the thirty-seventh verse. Thus a sttiver can deviate from
Yoga, only if he has not realized God. After God-realization,
there is no question of deviation or downfall from Yoga.

The Blessed Lord said: : :

O Partha, there is no fall for him, either here or hereafter; for

Comment:— _

[Arjuna is much anxious, to know the end of a striver,
who has failed to attain perfection, in Yoga. Lord Krsna knows
Arjuna's anxiety and so He removes it.] -

""Partha naiveha namutra vinaSastasya vidyate'—O son of Prtha,

a striver who deviates from Yoga, never falls (Gita 6/41—45).

It means that he does not go to a state, inferior to what he has. |
already attained. His. spiritual practice, and aim go with him, to

his next birth and he will not take birth, again and again.

Sage Bharata, by renouncing his kingdom observed penance, —
in seclusion. There, out of pity, he was attached to a young deer,
with the result that he had to get birth, as a deer. But he did -
not fall to a state inferior to what he had already attained, even
in the life of a deer. In that life also, it remembered its past
(Srimadbhagavata Section V, Chapter VII, VU). Similarly, one
who practises Yoga, but fails to attain perfection, may get birth
even as an animal, but does not fall to a state inferior to what
he has already attained, as he retains the spiritual propensities, |
stored up in the previous birth. This draws him towards God. I
myself have observed a dog sitting with devotees, listening to
religious discourses and moving about, with a group of devotees,
who were chanting, the Lord's name loudly.

'Na hi kalyanakrtkaSciddurgatirn tata gacchati'—Here ‘tata’, a
word of endearment, has been used. In the whole Gita, this word
has been used only once. It shows Lord Krsna's great affection
and grace, for Arjuna. The pronouncement of the Lord, is a
"
826,"Verse 40] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 789 |
great assurance for all strivers, ""The doer of good never comes
to grief"", or ‘One who works for self-redemption, never meets
with an evil fate’. It means, that a striver who, without being
attached to pleasure and prosperity, and engaged, in spiritual — 7
discipline to attain God-realization, has no fall, because He is ~~ :
his saviour. a oe

One, who is engrossed in the welfare of all creatures, and |
thinks of God-realization, 1s the most loving to Him, because he
is His fragment. So he has a real affinity for Him. How can he
meet with ill fate? Sometimes, it may seem, that he had fallen to
a state inferior to what he had already attained. But it so happens,
because of his pride. The Lord, gives him a warning, so that he
may be aware of his state and turn towards Him again with zeal.
Lord Krsna disappeared during His drama (pastime) of human
life, from the midst of the Gopis. At that time, they were very -
much perturbed and were at their wits end. Then He reappeared
again and said to them, that He had disappeared adoring them -
(Srimadbha. 10/32/21). Their welfare and memory were lingering,
in Him. When a person is inclined towards Him, he is most
loving to Him because He thinks that after having lost his way -
for long however he has started following the right way. God,
like a mother, always promotes the welfare of a devotee.
_ It means that feelings of spirituality once germinated, cannot
be wiped out, because whatever is done for God, becomes real
(Gita 17/27) viz., the real never ceases to be (Gita 2/16). Therefore, |
Lord Krsna says, that one who works for self-redemption never :
meets with an evil destiny, because the impressions of the past,
always imspire him towards spirituality. Even, if one goes to
lower births, his nature will be superior, to that of other members
of his class.*

Though Arjuna puts the question, ""What end, does a striver

* One whose nature has been good cannot take birth as a harmful poisonous :
creature such as a snake or a scorpion etc. |
"
827,"790 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
' meet, at the time of death?"" Yet Lord Krsna answers, that there
is no fall for him, here or hereafter. Now a question arises, why
Ajamila and Bilvamangala, were overpowered by prostitutes, _
and why there was a fall for them. The answer 1s, that people
thought that they had a fall, but actually it was not so. After
_ leaving the body, Ajamila was escorted by courtiers of the
_ Lord; and Bilvamangala, became a devotee of God. A devotee, ©
following spiritual discipline, may seem to have been degraded
sometimes, because of his carelessness. But, he never falls to a
state inferior to what he has already attained. If he happens to
have association, with the good or misfortune befalls him, he again
starts following the spiritual path, speedily.* But delay in God-
realization is indeed, a kind of downfall for him. Bad company
-etc., are decidedly obstacles for a striver, to spiritual progress.
So he should always beware of bad company, and should never
be overpowered by sensual pleasures and lust etc.

Comment:— -
'‘Prapya punyakrtarh lokan'—Those people, who make offerings
etc., in accordance with the ordinance of scriptures, attain the
worlds of the righteous viz., heaven. It means, that the righteous :
not the sinners, attain heaven. But strivers who have no desire
to reap the fruit of their virtuous actions, attain heaven without
much effort, while people who perform oblation, attain heaven
by making efforts. Moreover, in heaven also, their subtle passion
lingers, because their aim is to enjoy pleasure. Those, who at
the time of death, deviate from Yoga, attain heaven, but they
become indifferent to pleasures, as their aim is not to enjoy
pleasure. They have to go to heaven, because of their subtle -
desire, which is an obstacle to God-realization.
'Usitva SaSvatih samah'—Heaven, is attained, both by those
who perform penances and actions with some interested motive, -
as also, by those whose aim is to realize God, but deviate from
Yoga. However there is a vast difference, between the two. -
The former, having enjoyed heavenly pleasures, return to this
world of mortals on the exhaustion of their merit, and thus they
can stay there for a limited period only, while the latter, can
stay for an unlimited period, because their aim has been God- :
realization. Because of having a latent desire they go to heaven,
but they cannot be entangled in pleasure there. And their spiritual
development is not affected. The reason is, when even a seeker
of the Yoga, transcends the fruit of actions (6/44), how can one, _
who has deviated from Yoga, get entangled?
'Sucinarn srimatam gehe yogabhrasto'bhijayate'—The devotee,
who has deviated from Yoga after enjoying celestial pleasures,
ceases to have any taste in them and is reborn in the house of
the pure and prosperous, as a result of his sacred and spiritual
pursuits. There he, though subject to senses, feels drawn towards

Comment:— | — |
[There are two kinds of strivers—with having subtle desires,
and without such desires. The striver, whose aim is to realize
God and is interested in spirituality, but his desires have not been
wiped out completely, after living for countless years in heaven,
is reborn in the house of the pious and prosperous. This type of
striver, has already been described in the previous verse. In this
verse, there is a description of the striver, who is free from desire,
has developed dispassion, has only, the aim of God-realization
and practises Yoga, but has not attained perfection and deviated
from Yoga. Such a striver, instead of going to heaven, directly
takes birth in a family of enlightened Yogis.]
"
830,"Verse 42] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 793
‘Athava'—I have answered your question, about a striver
who deviates from Yoga, at the time of death. Now I want to
tell you about a dispassionate striver, who has disinclination for ;
the world, and is interested in spiritual perfection, but at the time
of death however if he deviates from Yoga.
“Yoginameva kule bhavati dhimatiém'—The dispassionate
striver, is born in the family of the enlightened Yogis, who
have realized God and whose intellects are fixed in Him.
It is mentioned in the scriptures that the beings born in
the family of the enlightened Yogis must get enlightenment
(Mundaka. 3/2/9). |
""Etaddhi durlabhataram loke janma yadidrsam'—Such a
birth, is very difficult to obtain in this world. In the family of
enlightened Yogis strivers get a favourable environment, which 7
draws out the latent Yoga element in them, and leads them
rapidly towards their goal. -
In the verse ‘Etat’ refers to a striver born in the family of the
enlightened Yogis, while 'Idrsam' means that he has got a chance
to have company of the enlightened Yogis. In the world, there
are two kinds of people 'Binduja’ and 'Nadaja’. Those who are
born of ovum and sperm of parents are called 'Binduja’, while
those who start following the spiritual path by the preaching of
great souls, are ‘Nadaja’. Here, he who is born in a family of
enlightened Yogis after falling from Yoga, is ""Binduja’ while the
striver who gets an opportunity to have the company of liberated
souls, is 'Nadaja’.
In the scriptures, it is mentioned that it is difficult to obtain
human life, but it is even more difficult to have company of great
souls. Naradaji, has also written in his book 'Bhaktisutra’ that
"
831,"794 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
the company of .great. souls, is very difficult, inaccessible and
infallible. The reason is, that great souls are very rare, and if by
God's grace one. gets their company,* it is difficult to recognise _
them. But the company of great souls, never goes in vain.

his birth, there. | | |

Comment:—

‘Tatra tarn buddhisamyogam labhate paurvadehikam'—The ~
term ‘Tatra’ (there) has been used to describe the condition
of the dispassionate striver after his birth in the family of the
enlightened souls. | |

'Paurvadehikam'—(Acquired in the former body) and
‘Buddhisarhyogam’ (spiritual discernment) phrases mean, that
the dispassionate striver, does not go to heaven, but is born in
a family of enlightened Yogis, where he regains knowledge of the
previous birth, and is naturally drawn towards God, because of
the impressions and latencies of the previous birth and continues
to practise Yoga. A traveller, while travelling on foot feels tired,
and sleeps on one side of a footpath. But, when he awakes, he
has not to cover the distance, which he has already covered.
Similarly a striver, regains the knowledge of the previous birth.
He is like a student, who goes through old lessons and grasps
"
832,"Verse 43] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 795

these immediately. Thus, favourable impressions of the previous |

birth, are aroused in him. a
""Yatate ca tato bhiyah samsiddhau'—In favourable surroundings, oa .

a striver tries harder, than before, for perfection: : oe

If we interpret, that both kinds of strivers, who deviate from
Yoga, go to heaven, and out of them, the one who has desire for
pleasure is born, in the house of pious and prosperous, while the
other who has no lust is born in a family of enlightened Yogis,
will it make any difference? Yes, it will. We cannot call the
striver, 'Paurvadehika’ (of the former body) if he is reborn after
going to heaven, because the duration of his stay in heaven,
will come in between the two births. Moreover, in heaven he |
cannot have union with knowledge, because there is abundance
of pleasure, in heaven. _

There is one more point, which needs attention. A striver,
having lust goes to heaven. But why should a striver who is free
from passion and lust, go to heaven? It is a kind of punishment -
to send, such a striver to heaven, which is fully unjustified.

Appendix—tThe spiritual progress pertains to the self and the -
mundane progress pertains to the non-self. Therefore the worldly
wealth gets destroyed but the spiritual wealth is not destroyed
even by falling (deviating) from Yoga. The spiritual progress can
be veiled but cannot be destroyed and is revealed at times.

The impressions of the spiritual practice of the previous life
that are settled (left) in a striver’s intellect, have been called
here ‘buddhisarnyoga’.

Link:—In the previous verse, Lord Krsna explained that a
striver who is born in a family of enlightened Yogis regains, oe
knowledge of the previous birth and strives more than before,
for perfection. Now he describes the striver who deviates from
Yoga, and is born in the house of the pious and prosperous.

One who takes birth in the house of the prosperous, though
subject to the senses, is drawn towards God because of the former

~ Comment:— |
7 ‘Purvabhyasena tenaiva hriyate hyavaSo'pi sah'—A striver, who
is born in the house of the pious and prosperous, does not get
such a favourable environment and company, as. the one who is
born in the house of enlightened Yogis, yet because of sacred and _
spiritual propensity stored up in the previous birth, he is drawn
towards God, in spite of his attachment to pleasures.

‘Avaso'pi’ means, that though he has lived in heaven for ~
countless years and enjoyed pleasure there, and in the house
of the prosperous also, there are pleasures in abundance, he -
is overpowered by his senses. In spite of all this, he is drawn
towards ‘God, by force of the practice of the previous births.
The reason is, that the passion for pleasure is unreal, while the
influence of the spiritual life, is real. So the real influence draws
the striver, who deviates from Yoga, towards God.

'Jijiiasurapi yogasya Sabdabrahmiativartate'—In this verse, Lord
Krsna explains the importance of a seeker of Yoga, in order to
describe the importance of the Yogi. When the seeker of Yoga,
transcends actions and their fruits as laid down in the Vedas, how
can he having a firm determination for God-realization, have a
fall? He will surely, attain salvation or God-realization.

| The seeker of Yoga is he who attaches more importance
to Yoga than pleasures and prosperity but his desire for
pleasures and prosperity has not been wiped out. He has not
"
834,"Verse 44] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 797
attained perfection (to Yoga) and is a seeker of Yoga. Even
such a seeker transcends the actions and their fruits. Then
the striver who has deviated from Yoga is far superior to the /
seeker. The same fact has been explained by Lord Krsna in
the fortieth verse of the second chapter when He declares, |
""In this path of Yoga (equanimity) there is no loss of effort
and even a little practice of this discipline protects one from
great fear (of birth and death) viz., leads him to salvation.""
Thus the one who practises Yoga cannot have a fall, he will
undoubtedly attain perfection or salvation.

(i) Such strivers who practise Yoga but deviate from it are
very rare. Among thousands of people scarcely one strives for
perfection (Giti 7/3) and it is he who deviates from Yoga. There -
is great glory of such strivers. Even the seeker of the Yoga
transcends the fruits of actions viz., he develops disinclination -
even for the highest level of celestial existence, the Brahmaloka
(the abode of Brahma), because all the worlds including that of .
Brahma involve return and rebirth while he does not want rebirth.
When there is so much glory of the seeker of Yoga, how far
superior should the striver who practises Yoga, be? The reason
is that his aim has been to attain Yoga (equanimity) though at
the time of death he has deviated from Yoga.

Therefore, if a striver has an exclusive aim to attain God-
realization, he will transcend the fruits of actions, performed
with some motive as laid down in the Vedas.

(ii) Even if a striver fails to attain equanimity, he should have
it as his aim. As Tulasidasaji has said in the Ramacaritamanasa
about himself that he is a man of the meaner sort but his ambition
is very high, he wants to get nectar though even butter milk is
not available to him (1/8/4). It means that the striver should
have a lofty aim and he should have a keen desire to achieve
"
835,"798 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
that aim. It is God's nature that He does not mind the error of
action of the striver but He notices what he wants, feels, aims
and remembers hundreds of times what he has in his heart and
is pleased with it (1/29/2-3). | |
A blind saint went to a temple to behold the Lord. One day
a person asked him why he had gone to the temple when he
was unable to see the Lord. The saint replied, ""It is true that I
am unable to see Him. But is He also unable to see me? My
purpose is served when He beholds me."" a
Similarly, we may not attain equanimity but we should have
an aim to attain it. By doing so our purpose will be served
because God is omniscient and. He knows what a striver has |
in his heart. : :

_ Appendix—The worldly virtues (such as feeding poor etc.,
with desire for fruit) are virtues contrary to sins but the divine
virtues inculcated through association with God are extraordinary.
Therefore the worldly virtues do not draw a man towards God;
but the virtues pertaining to God, draw man towards God. These -
virtues are not dissipated by bearing fruit (Gita 2/40). Renunciation
of worldly desires and inclination towards God—these two are
virtues pertaining to God. . | |

‘Purvabhyasena tenaiva’—This expression means that though
in the present life the striver does not get an opportunity of good
company and good discussion pertaining to God, yet because of
the past latencies he is drawn towards God. In this past practice
there is no action (pravrtti) but there is (automatic progress)
‘gati’.* In ‘jijfia@surapi yogasya Sabdabrahmativartate’ also there
is no practice of action but there is progress as ‘gati’. It means |
that in this practice there is no effort and there is no doership

~ * In order to know the distinction between ‘Pravrtti’ and ‘Gati’ vide appendix
to the sixth verse of the fifteenth chapter (6/45).
"
836,"Verse 45] - SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 799
but there is ‘gati’ (automatic elevation). In ‘gati’ there is the
power of attracting a striver towards God. An endeavour for
spiritual gain is an action while ‘gati’ automatically goes on
(due to past latencies). | :

birth in the family of enlightened Yogis and striving more than

'Tu'—It means when the seeker of the Yoga of equanimity

should not transcend the fruit of actions and attain perfection.

steadily. He remains constantly conscious that he has to follow
~ - this path. . a ee |
The striver deviating from Yoga takes birth in the house
of the pious and prosperous and is drawn on one side towards _
God by force of the former practice, while on the other side
towards the world because of the worldly temptation. If he
by diligent efforts and manly behaviour renounces worldly
pleasures, he will realize God. The reason is that when even
a seeker of Yoga transcends the fruit of action, why will a
Yogi who strives with assiduity not realize God? As a person
engaged in forbidden action after getting a shock, deviates :
from it and strives more for God-realization, a striver by -
taking birth in the house of the pious and prosperous strives
hard. for God-realization. oe | oe
‘SamSuddhakilbisah'—By striving for God-realization, he is
purged of all sins viz., his desire for pleasures, prosperity, praise ;
and honour etc., is completely wiped out. His diligent efforts
reveal that he is purged of all sins. :

_ ‘Anekajanmasarhsiddhah'*—Spirituality has enhanced in him
through successive births. He has been purified from sins in the
human birth by practising Yoga, in the second birth in heaven
by having disinclination for pleasures, and in the third birth in
the house of the pious and prosperous by striving assiduously
for God-realization. Thus he is purified from sins through many
births.t Here many births denote these three births.

* ""Anekajanma’' (many births) means more than one birth. .

+ Similarly, a dispassionate striver who has deviated from Yoga is purged
of sins first by being dispassionate and secondly by striving promptly for God-
realization by getting birth in the family of the Yogi. Thus these two births are
many births for him.
"
838,"Verse 46] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI  =————™—CO. 8011
‘Tato yati param gatim'-——Therefore, he reaches the supreme
state. It means that he attains the Supreme Bliss, by gaining
which He does not reckon any other gain greater than that,
and wherein established he is not moved even by the heaviest |
affliction (Gita 6/22). — . oe a
a | A Vital Fact |
_. In fact every human being has passéd through many births
already. Therefore he has been called 'Aneka-janma-sarhsiddha’. In
heaven he enjoyed the fruit of his virtuous actions and thus was
purged of virtues. In hells by suffering tortures he was purged of
sins. Similarly, in the eighty-four lac forms of lives by getting
the fruit of his sinful actions he was purged of sins.* Thus by Oo
being purified from virtues and sins he has perfected himself.
Secondly, a human being by striving assiduously can attain
the Supreme State or Supreme Goal because the Lord by His
grace has bestowed upon him this human birth, the very last of
all births so that he may attain the Supreme Bliss. Therefore, -
every person should strive assiduously to attain perfection or
the Supreme Bliss.

‘Jnanibhyo'pi mato'dhikah'—Jfiant (men of learning), in

this context are those, who possess knowledge of scriptures,

such as the knowledge of the Disciplines of Knowledge, Action

and Devotion etc., and deliver discourses, but whose aim, is to

enjoy pleasure and prosperity. A Yogi, is superior to such men -

'‘Karmibhyascadhiko yogi'—A Yogi, is superior to those

ritualists, who perform elaborate rituals, such as sacrifice, charity,

and pilgrimage etc., in order to, obtain pleasure and prosperity

etc., here and hereafter, because the Yog1's aim is to realize God,

while the ritualists has a desire, for worldly enjoyments etc. 7
Thus a Yogi, is superior to ascetics, also men of learning

and ritualists, because his aim is to attain God-realization,

while others' aim, is to enjoy worldly pleasure and prosperity

etc. Ascetics, men of learning and ritualists—all the three, are

engaged in activities. Forbearance in ascetics, learning in Jnanis,

and rituals, in ritualists are special characteristics of the three.

All the three, having selfish interests, are not Yogis but Bhogis

(sensuous). If they had been selfless Yogis, God would have

neither compared them with a Yogi, nor would He have declared,

a Yogi superior to them. |
'Tasmadyogi bhavarjuna'—Therefore, Arjuna, be a Yogi free

from attachment and aversion viz., remain detached just like a

lotus leaf which though constantly in touch with water, does not

permit being wetted with it. The same fact, has been explained |
by Lord Krsna when He declares, “Be established in Yoga, O :
Arjuna” (Gita 8/27).
In the beginning of the fifth chapter, Arjuna asked Lord .
Krsna, ""Which of the two renunciation of action (Sankhyayoga),
or performance of action .(Karmayoga), is better?” In response to
his question Lord Krsna explained Sankhyayoga (the Discipline .
of Knowledge), Karmayoga (the Discipline of Action) and
Dhyanayoga (the Discipline of Meditation). But He, before this
verse, did not advise him to be a Yogi. It is only here that He
directs him to be a Yogi, because it is decidedly good for him. |
Appendix—There are two different spheres—one for ‘Bhogis’ _
(voluptuary) and the other for ‘Yogis’. A “Bhog? is not a ‘Yogi’
and a “Yog?’ is not a ‘Bhogi’. Those who work with an interested -
motive are ‘Bhogis’; while those who work in a disinterested
manner are ‘Yogis’. Therefore a Yogi, who has no desire for
fruit, 1s superior to ascetics, men of learning and ritualists who
have selfish motives. -

Comment:—
""Yoginamapi sarvesam'—Those Yogis, who want to break off
their affinity for Matter and practise the Disciplines of Action,
Knowledge and Meditation etc., are superior to ascetics, and
ritualists etc. But he who devoutly worships Me, is the best of all.
""Yah Sraddhavan'—He, who has faith only in Me, and My
glory, and existence, worships Me, with his mind focussed on Me.
‘Madgatenantaratmana mari bhajate'-—When a. striver,
accepts the affinity that he is God's and God is his, his mind
gets engrossed, in God automatically. As the mind of a girl
after her marriage is absorbed in the affairs of the house, of her ~~
father-in-law, a devotee's mind gets absorbed in God, without _
making any effort. His mind, while he performs several duties
of his routine, clings to God, automatically.
All activities, whether spiritual such as meditation, worship
etc., or secular, such as eating, sleeping or pertaining to livelihood,
such as farming, business or service etc., of a devotee, who ”
becomes only God's, without having any attachment for the |
world, are included in adoration. |
Lord Krsna in the fifty-fifth verse of the eleventh chapter,
explains the traits of a devotee having exclusive devotion to God,
who works for the Lord's sake, depends on Him, is devoted to
Him, is free from attachment and is without hatred, for any being.
‘Sa me yuktatamo matah'—All strivers, who having
disinclination for the world, are inclined towards spirituality,
and want to realize God, are devout. Those, who seek refuge
in the Lord, who is endowed with attributes, but is formless
viz., all-pervading Lord, are more devout. However, those who
take refuge in the Lord, Who is endowed with attributes, are
the most devout.
"
842,"Verse 47} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 805
A devotee, who is most devout, will get mastery over all
kinds of disciplines, (Yogas) such as of Action, Knowledge and
Devotion etc., because God is the great Lord of all the Yogas ;
(disciplines), and when a devotee takes refuge in Him, he becomes
the most devout.
The most devout, devotee never falls from Yoga, because
his mind never abandons the Lord, and therefore, the Lord
also does not abandon him. At the time of death, because of
unconsciousness or much pain, if he 1s unable to think of God,
God thinks of him.* So how can he fall from Yoga?
It means, that a devotee who wholeheartedly depends on -
God without depending on anyone else, or even on his efforts
does not fall from Yoga. God does not let him down. But, he -
who attaches value to worldly things and relies on his efforts,
for him there is possibility to fall from Yoga. His fall, may be |
due to his mind's diversion towards the world. A devotee, does
not fall because at the time of death, he calls the Lord due to -
his sole dependence on Him. Even if he is unable to think of the
Lord, the Lord thinks of him, because of his exclusive devotion
and thus he instead of falling, from Yoga, attains Him.
The Lord declares, such a Yogi is the most devout Yogi. It
does not mean, that other Yogis do not attain Yoga. It means,
that though all the Yogis by breaking off their affinity for the
world, become completely free from bondage and sins, and attain
the Supreme Bliss, yet, spiritual love manifests itself in him,
who becomes God's and that love accelerates every moment
without any decay, extinction and satiation. It is because of
*The Lord declares—""I myself think of the wood-like and stone-like
devotee at the time of his death and bestow upon him the Supreme State.
If a devotee at the time of death because of phlegm and wind etc., can't
think of Me, I Myself think of him. If I don’t do so, no one else can be
nore ungrateful than I.""
"
843,"806 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
this. manifestation, that the Lord regards, such a devotee, as the
most devout. | : : |

In the beginning of the fifth chapter, Arjuna asked Lord
Krsna; ""Which of the two, the Yoga of Knowledge or the Yoga _
of Action, is better?"" Lord Krsna replied, ""The Yoga (discipline)
of Action, is superior to the Discipline of Knowledge."" But He
did not tell him which discipline, was good for him. After
describing these in the fifth chapter, in the beginning of the
sixth chapter, He laid emphasis on the glory of, the Discipline
of Action. Then He described that equanimity, which is attained
by the Discipline of Action, is also attained by the Discipline
of Meditation, and He explained the Discipline of Meditation.
Then Arjuna said, that unsteadiness of mind is an obstacle to /
meditation. So Lord Krsna clarified the doubt. After that Arjuna -
asked, ""What fate does a striver, whose mind is diverted from
Yoga at the time of death, meet with?"" Lord Krsna, answered
the question and, in the forty-sixth verse while describing the
glory of Yoga, ordered him to be a Yogi. But, Lord Krsna did
not clearly mention, which Yoga in his opinion, is superior to 7
others. So, in the forty-seventh verse, He himself declares, ""He
who devoutly worships Me, 1s the best Yogi"".-But, Aruna 1s
not able to understand His view-point, and so he again puts the
question, at the beginning of the twelfth chapter, ""Who is the
better of the two—the devotees, who with their minds constantly
fixed in You, adore You, possessed of form and attributes, or
those who adore only the imperishable Formless Brahma?"" In
response to this question Lord Krsna says, ""I consider them to be
the best Yogis who, endowed with supreme faith, and ever-united
through love, with Me, worship Me, with mind centred on Me.""

The Lord, declares that a devotee following the Discipline
"
844,"Verse 47} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 807
of Devotion, 1s the best Yogt of all the other Yogis, because
the man (soul) is a fragment of God, and by accepting his
affinity for the world and the body, he is bound. When he
breaks off this assumed affinity, he becomes free and happy.
Though in this freedom, there is no dependence, on things,
men and actions etc., yet if he enjoys this freedom by thinking,
""I am free from pain and desire,"" he has subtle affinity, for
the world. This is finiteness (limitedness), in assumed freedom.
This state is called, state of having become one, with the eternal
(Gita 18/54). | |
This subtle egoism is also wiped out by being established
in that state of identity with the eternal, because by having no .
affinity for matter and its evolutes, egoism which is a fragment
of Matter, comes to an end. It means, that Yogis of Action and -
Knowledge, become free from egoism, with the passage of time.
But, the egoism of a Yogi of Devotion perishes in the very |
beginning, as he becomes God's. A Yogi of Devotion, possesses the
traits of friendliness, compassion etc., for all beings (Gita 12/13), -
which are rarely found, in the Yogis of Action and Knowledge.
It means that a devotee, following the Discipline of Devotion,
regards himself as insignificant from the very beginning* and he
develops the virtues of politeness, friendliness, compassion and
self-satisfaction etc., during the period when he strives, and these
virtues attain maturity during the state of perfection. Therefore,
subtle egoism, of a devotee perishes. So the Lord has called
such a devotee, the best.
The uniqueness of devotion, is that it accelerates in the new
form, it does neither attenuate, nor perish, nor get satiated. The
Lord also longs for such devotion, or love. This desire of the

: There is one ‘more point, which needs attention. In the, :
Disciplines of Action and Knowledge, a striver has his: own

devotee without having any independent faith or belief of his
own, depends completely on God, he identifies his desire with
His desire. He does not worry, even to attain salvation or God- ©

for his bodily maintenance and protects, what has already been

Appendix—A man is said to be established in that thing or
person where his mind and intellect get fixed (Gita 12/8). Here -
the expression ‘madgatenantaratmana’ denotes that his mind is
focussed on God, and the term ‘Sraddhavan’ denotes that his
intellect is fixed on God. Therefore such a devotee because of
his intimate kinship with God is established in Him. —

Out of all the Yogis such as Karmayogi, Jiianayog1, ;

_ Dhyanayogi, Hathayogi, Layayogi and Rajayogi etc., the devotee
of God is the best of all. The same fact about His devotee
has also been mentioned in several other references as ‘te me
yuktatama matah’ (12/2), ‘bhaktaste’tiva me priyah’ (12/20) and
‘sa yogi paramo matah’ (6/32).

Devotion is the most important of all the disciplines
for God-realization. Not only this but all the disciplines end
in devotion. Karmayoga and Jiianayoga etc., are means but
Supreme Love is an end. Devotion is so extensive that it is at
the beginning of every discipline and is also at the end. Devotion
at the beginning of every discipline consists in the form of
attraction towards God because without attraction no one can
engage himself in spiritual practice. At the end of a discipline,
"
846,"Verse 47] _SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 809
devotion~is, transformed into the form of Supreme Love which _-
enhances every moment—‘madbhaktirh labhate param’ (Gita
18/54). Therefore in ‘Brahmasiitra’ the ‘Dharma’ in the shape ,
of the devotion for God has been declared -as superior to other ;
‘Dharmas’——‘atastvirajyayo lingacca’ (3/4/39). oe |

His devotion is unworldly. In attainment of the Supreme Love
only lies the fulfilment of human life. |

INTRODUCTION
Lord Krsna, in the forty-sixth verse of the sixth chapter,
described the glory of a Yogi and in the forty-seventh verse, He
declared, ""Of all Yogis, he, who devoutly worships Me, with
his mind focussed on Me, is considered by Me, to be the most
devout Yogi."" When a devotee thinks of God, he gets absorbed
in Him. Similarly when something concerning His devotee is
discussed, God also becomes enraptured in it. In the same state
of mind, also Lord Krsna, full of grace and affection for Arjuna,
starts the seventh chapter on his own. |

| | The Blessed Lord said: | |
Listen, O Partha (Arjuna), how, with your mind attached to
Me, and taking refuge in Me and practising Yoga, you will, without
any doubt, know Me fully. 1 |
Comment:—
""Mayyasaktamanah'—He, whose mind is attached to Me alone,
has not to think of Me, but his mind always remains absorbed in
Me. He is not, in the least, attached to the sensual pleasures of
this world or the next world, and remains indifferent to comfort,
name, fame and other, earthly or heavenly acquisitions.
There are two means, by which mind may be attached to Him.
"
849,"812 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 7
(i) A striver, who from his heart depending only on God,
adores Him, his mind, by His grace is attached to Him. As a
servant, in his master’s house, even without doing any work
as the master did not allot any work for him on a day gets
payment, a devotee with the only aim to attach his mind to Him ;
by depending upon Him, gets success in attaching his mind to
Him, by His grace. - |
_ (i) God pervades everywhere, at all times and in all things,
: men and creatures etc., and He belongs to all. So a devotee
thinks, that He is here, He is present at the time, He is in
him, and belongs to him also. By believing so, if he chants
His name, his mind gets attached to Him very easily, during
spiritual practice. : | ;
'Madaégrayah'—He takes refuge in Me alone viz., and depends
on Me, alone. -
It is in the nature of man, that he depends on someone, or
the other. Being a fragment of God, he actually seeks God. But :
he, without knowing his true affinity for God, accepts his affinity
for the body and the world. All the worldly things, including -
body, are perishable and so they cannot satisfy him, while God, is
eternal, gracious and omnipotent, so he, by accepting his affinity
for Him, should depend on Him only, and be subject to His
| will, because He creates even unfavourable circumstances, for
his welfare.
Mind in God, gets absorbed through love. Love develops
through affinity. Dependence is sought, upon the greatest and the
most powerful, God is omnipotent. Therefore, a striver should rely
on Him only, and remain happy in His dispensation. He needs
nothing, such as, an individual, an object or any circumstance.
Dependence on God, in this way is 'Madasrayah’.
'Yogam yuijan'—A striver by accepting his true affinity
for God, remaining equanimous in success and failure, adores
Him. His performance of different activities either spiritual or
"
850,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI _ 813
mundane, is practice of Yoga. It means that he, depending on
God with his mind attached to Him, accepts his union with Him,
while discharging his duty. All his activities, are according to
His will. He does not act in such a way, that he may suffer
disunion from Him. | .

‘AsamSayam samagram mam'—He, whose mind is attached
to the Lord, who depends on Him and who has accepted his
true affinity for Him, knows Him in full, without any doubt viz.,
he knows that the Lord, manifests Himself in the form of Lord
Siva, GaneSa, Siirya (the Sun) and Visnu. He is known both
with form and attributes; and without any form and attribute.
He ts also in the form of incarnations.

_ A Jijanayogi, can know Him and realize Him. But a devotee,
can know Him in full, and have His vision in the form of his -
favourite deity. The Lord does not stop thinking of the devotion
of His devotees. : : |

'Yatha jiasyasi tacchrnu’'—By the term ""Yatha’*, Lord Krsna
says, that He will tell him how to know Him; and by the word
'tat't, He means, that He will tell him that, which he wants to _
know. In these words, Lord Krsna by using the second person |
for Arjuna, asks him to listen to Him, how he will know Him,
in full.
In the forty-seventh verse of the sixth chapter, in the expression
'He who worships Me endowed with faith, is deemed by Me,
to be the most devout’, the Lord by using ‘he’ the third person,
makes a general statement, while here in the expression 'Hear
how you shall know Me' He uses the second person pointedly
* The. term ""Yatha’ has been used to describe how to know him from the
gross to the subtle (As water is subtler than earth, fire is subtler than water and
air 1s subtler than fire etc.). It has been described from the fourth to the seventh
verses of this chapter.
f'Tat' means that God is the seed of the world. It has been described from
the eighth to the twelfth verses of this chapter.
"
851,"814 | SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
to address Arjuna, how he will know Him fully.

In the first six chapters, the word ‘Samagram’ (in full), has
not been used for the Lord. So, this term signifies, different
forms of the Lord, as well as, His glory and other divine traits,
while this term, in the twenty-third verse of the fourth chapter, |
in the expression 'He who works for the sake of sacrifice, the
whole action, is dissolved’ the term, 'whole’ has been used for
totality of actions. | BS

(i) Lord Krsna means that a devotee will know Him in full,
if he, instead of having attachment for pleasures, is attached to
Him. If he instead of depending on body, family and prosperity, —
depends on Him, and if he has no desire of his own.

(ii) Real affinity for God, is called 'Yogarh’ and assumption
(acceptance) of that affinity incessantly, is called ""Yufijan’.

It means, that a striver instead of assuming his affinity for
body, mind and senses etc., should realize his real affinity,
for God. | -
In fact practice of Yoga is not so important, as renunciation
| of attachment, for and dependence, on the world. By doing so,
meditation upon God will be practised automatically, and all
~ actions will be performed, without any desire for their fruit. In
such a case, he will not have to practise Yoga. It means, that
he who attaches importance to the perishable worldly things and
persons etc., cannot know, the all-pervading God. If a man has
_ links with a great man of the society, he feels exalted. Similarly,

- when our intimacy is aroused with God, who is our disinterested
friend and well-wisher and Whose fragment we are, how much
more exalted we must feel! In that case, unique and supreme
love, is aroused and the striver's mind gets attached, to Him and
he depends on Him, quite spontaneously. :
"
852,"Verse 1] ~ SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 815
-
: ‘Agraya’, ‘Avalambana’, 'Adhinata’, ‘Prapatti' and ‘Sahara’,
are synonyms of the term ‘surrender’ (refuge), yet they have
different meanings. _ | °
(1) Agraya:—We cannot live, without the support of earth.
In the same way, we cannot live, without the support of God.
This is called 'Agraya’.

(2) Avalambana:—lIf a man's arm is broken, it is dressed and
slung from the neck, with a band. Thus the arm, is supported with
a sling, while hanging from the neck. In like manner, a helpless
person seeks refuge in God. This support is called 'Avalambana’.

(3) Adhinat&a:—It is of two kinds: (a) Someone may force |
us to depend upon him. (b) We ourselves may willingly, depend _
on some other. Similarly, a devotee with exclusive devotion and
without any selfish motive, becomes an attendant upon God,
by regarding Him, as his master. This service with exclusive :
devotion, is called 'Adhinata’. :

(4) Prapatti:—When a devotee, like a helpless person, offers -
obeisance before a great man, prostrates before God, it is called
‘Prapatti’.

(5) Sahara:—When a devotee, in order to be liberated, from
the cycle of birth and death, takes refuge in God, like a drowning
man who catches at a straw, it 1s called ‘Sahara’.

A devotee, is said to take refuge in God, when he is attached
only to God and depends only on Him i.e., when he fixes his
mind and intellect only, on God. When a man himself takes
refuge in God, with his mind and intellect, he possesses all the
virtues, of a surrendered devotee.

When a striver resolves, that his so-called mind and
intellect, are God's, his mind is naturally attached to Him, and
he depends only on Him i.e., he becomes 'Mayydsaktamanah’'
and 'Madaérayah’. : |
"
853,"816 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA - [Chapter 7
In fact, all the worldly things are in the process of decay
‘every moment, and we being eternal, have’ no real affinity with
_ them. So, if we renounce this assumed affinity,.and only.aim at
__ salvation, we shall.take refuge in Him automatically, because we.
are God's, despite ever having developed disinclination for Him,
due to our inclination, for the world. As soon as, this. assumed
affinity or inclination are renounced, our: affinity or inclination
for God, will manifest itself, and that is axiomatic.
Appendix—-The devotee, whose mind has been naturally
attracted towards God, who has taken refuge in God and who
has accepted his axiomatic eternal union (intimate relationship)
with God, knows God in full. All is God this is the integral
(entire) form of God. | | ee |
In the term ‘mayyasaktamanah’ there is predominance of
love (devotion) and in-‘madasrayah’ there is predominance of _
faith (belief). : po |
‘Samagrarh mam’— In this expression the term ‘samagrarh’
is adjective and the term ‘marh’ (God) is the noun qualified.
A devotee’s affinity instead of being with adjective is with the |
noun-qualified i.e., with God. —
In the expression ‘sraddhavan bhajate yo mam’ used at the
end of the sixth chapter, what is the form of ‘mam’? The Lord
answers the questions here—‘mam’ is My entire form.
“Yatha jnasyasi tacchrmu’—I shall describe My full form
in such a manner, using such a device, in such a style that you
will easily know My real form. | :
Arjuna in the preceding chapter expressed his doubt—‘etanme
samSayam krsna’ (6/39). Therefore the Lord here declares that He
will unfold to him the fact by which he will have no doubt.

knowledge about Me, is limited, so they cannot know Myself, in

omniscient. After knowing it, nothing else remains to be known.
In the sixteenth verse of the tenth chapter, Arjuna says -
to Lord Krsna, ""You alone can describe in full; Your divine
glories"" (10/16). So Lord Krsna in response to his curiosity,
says, ""I shall tell you of My important divine glories, because
there is no end to My manifestations"" (10/19). At the end of
this chapter again, He declares, ""There is no end of My divine
glories” (10/40). Here (Gin 7/2) He declares, ""I shall unfold to
you the true essence of real knowledge (realization) and having
* Here the adjective ""Vijnana’ qualifies the noun 'Jiiana' and so is superior to
‘Jnana’. Here the belief that the world is born of the Lord and again merges in Him
is knowledge (wisdom) (Jiiana) while the realization, that in the world there is
nothing else except the manifestation of God, is the real knowledge (Vijiana).
7 A man cannot describe his own experience in full because the thoughts
and feelings cannot be clearly expressed in words. When a man cannot express his
own experience in words, how can he teach and unfold the knowledge (wisdom)
along with real knowledge like the Lord?
"
855,"818 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 7
known which, nothing else remains to be known.” It means, that
God's glories, manifestations and powers etc., are endless. In the
Ramacaritamanasa also, it-has been-declared, ""The form of the
Lord. without.attribute, is easy to know, while the form endowed —-
with attributes, is too difficult to understand. His manifestations,
are so varied, that even ascetics find themselves, at their wits end.

It means that there is no end to the glories of ‘the Lord,
endowed with attributes. So, how could a man know Him, by
using his mind? But a man can know the Divine essence, which
is all-pervading. As in different ornaments, made of gold, there
is nothing but gold, similarly, in the whole universe, there is
nothing else, except Divine manifestation. A-man, can know of
gold without knowing about different ornaments. Similarly, a
striver, can know that God pervades everywhere, in all creatures -
and things etc., even though, he may not know the names of
different .creatures and things etc.,. which form parts. of His
divine glories. By. knowing the reality about God, nothing else
remains to be known, in the same way, as thirst is quenched,
after drinking water. — . : -

In the second verse of the tenth chapter, the Lord declared,
""Neither gods nor great sages, know the secret of My birth.” In
the third verse, He declares, ""He who knows Me, as unborn and
without beginning, among men, is undeluded and purged of all
sins."" Now, a question arises, how a man can know Him, when
even gods and great sages, do not know Him. The answer is, that
if a striver, accepts Him as unborn and without beginning, with
a firm faith, it means that he knows Him, because it is within
the power of man, only to accept Him as unborn and without
beginning. As a child, cannot see a marriage procession of its
parents, so to gods, sages, liberated souls etc., cannot know
of incarnations, godly sports and divine glories, of the Lord,
because He is limitless and unfathomable. But a devotee can
know Him in essence. |
"
856,"Verse 2] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 819

In order to know the Lord in reality, in the Discipline of
Knowledge, there is pre-eminence of knowledge, while in the
Discipline of Devotion, there is pre-eminence of assumption, or
acceptance. If reality is accepted firmly, it cannot be given up, :
because it is real. When no one, can force a man to renounce,
even a false assumption, how can an assumption of real affinity
for God, be renounced? This assumption, is in no way, less
significant than knowledge; it is as effective as knowledge. |

In the Discipline of Devotion, there is pre-eminence of
acceptance. In the first verse of the tenth chapter, Lord Krsna says
to Arjuna, ""O mighty-armed, listen to My supreme word, which I
speak to you, out of a desire to do you good."" Here, ‘listen’ means .
‘accept’. Importance is attached to acceptance, because it is, the
context of devotion. In the Discipline of Knowledge, importance is ~
attached to knowledge. In the first verse of the fourteenth chapter,
Lord Krsna declares, ""I impart to you, the supreme knowledge, the
best of all forms of knowledge, acquiring which, all sages have |
attained the highest perfection."" In the Discipline of Devotion,
a striver knows Him by accepting His Existence, while in the -
Discipline of Knowledge, a man accepts Him, by knowing Him.
In perfection, both of them, are identified. _ |

An Exceptional Fact Pertaining to Knowledge (Wisdom)

The world, is born of the Lord and it merges into Him.
Therefore, He is the root of the world—this belief (acceptance)
is knowledge. There is nothing in the world, except God viz.,
the world is nothing except manifest Divinity—this realization,
is real knowledge (Vijfiana).

Lord Krsna (in 7/4—6) declares, ""My nature, is of two
kinds—lower and higher and I am the origin of the whole
universe."" By this declaration, Lord Krsna referred to knowledge
(Jnana). ""There is nothing else, besides Me. Like. clusters, of
"
857,"820 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA (Chapter?
yarn-beads, formed by knots on a thread, all this is threaded on
Me"" (7/7). By this declaration Lord Krsna explains what real
knowledge (Vijiana) is?

""I am the sapidity in water, the light in the moon and the
sun, the eternal seed, of all beings. Whatever other entities
there are, born of sattva (the mode of goodness), of rajasa (the
principle of activity), (the mode of passion) and of tamasa (the
principle of inertia), (the mode of ignorance), know these all,

| as evolved from Me, alone"" (7/8—-12). By this declaration, He
explains the essence of knowledge. ""In reality neither I exist in
them nor they in Me viz., I manifest Myself in all forms, because
none have their free existence"" (7/12). By this declaration, He
explains realization (Vijnana). _

""The whole of this creation, is deluded by objects, evolved

from the three modes of nature (prakrti). But those who are
not deluded, by the modes of nature and accept that these are
born of Me and are absorbed in Me—by accepting so, they
take refuge in Me alone, and cross the divine illusion of Mine. — -
Such devotees, are of four types—a seeker of worldly objects,
a sufferer, the seeker of knowledge, and a man of wisdom. All
these, are noble but the man of wisdom is extremely dear, to
Me and he is My own Self"" (7/13—18). By this declaration, He
explains of knowledge, ""The man of realization, who realizes, that
all is God, is very rare (7/19)."" By this declaration He explains
realization, (Vijiiana). |

""Those who, being motivated by desires worship gods, gain
perishable fruit, while those who are My devotees, attain Me. I
am not manifest to those, who do not know Me, as the unborn
and imperishable Supreme Spirit. I know the beings of the past,
the present and the future, but no one knows Me. Those, who are
subject to illusion, by the delusion of pairs of opposites, follow
a cycle of birth and death. But, the sins of those who worship
Me with a firm resolve, come to an end, and they become free
"
858,"Verse 2] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 821
from the pairs of opposites” (7/20—28). By this declaration also,
He explains knowledge (Jnana), “Those who take refuge in Me,
know Brahma (the Infinite), Adhyatma (Embodied souls), Karma
(Action), Adhibhuta (Matter), Adhidatva (Brahma) and Adhtyajiia -
{the unmanifest Divinity), viz., they realize that I manifest Myself,
in all the movable, as well as the immovable (7/29-30). By this.
declaration He explains realization (Vijfiana).
'Yajjfiatva neha bhiyo'nyajjiatavyamavasisyate'—After
knowing this wisdom, and with realization, nothing remains
to be known. It means that there is nothing else besides Me
(Gita 7/7), and that all, is God (7/19). After knowing this reality,
nothing else remains to be known. On the other hand, if a striver
possesses all knowledge about the world, without knowing Me, -
all his efforts are in vain, they bear no fruit. -
Whatever, a striver knows with his senses, mind and intellect, —
is not true knowledge about God, because these all belong to
matter and matter cannot know reality, which is beyond matter.
When one takes refuge in Him, he knows Him naturally, without
making any effort, because He can be known by the self, rather -
than, with mind and intellect etc.
Appendix—The Para Prakrti (higher nature) and the Apara
Prakrti (lower nature) have no independent existence—this is
‘jana’ (knowledge) and the higher and the lower nature—all .
is God—this is “Vijfiana’. Therefore all including ‘ego’ is only
God—this 1s Jiana with Vijiana. :
‘Jnatavyam’—which must be known and which can be known
is called ‘Jiiatavya’.
Having known ‘Jnana’ with ‘Vijiana’ viz., the entire form of
God, nothing remains to be known viz., he who wants to know
the Pure-Reality, nothing remains to be known to him. The reason
is that when there is nothing else besides God (seventh verse of
this chapter), then what more will remain to be known?
Someone may raise a question that the Lord declares that
"
859,"822 S§RIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
he. will tell ‘Jiiana’ with ‘Vijiiana’, it means. that the primary
importance goes to. ‘Jnana’ while -“Vijiiana’ is of secondary
importance. But. actually it is not so, only ‘Jiiana’ can lead
to salvation but ‘endless bliss of love’ is attained only when -
it is accompanied by ‘Vijnana’. ‘Jana’ is like money and
‘Vijiiana’ is the feeling of attraction. Money does not provide
the pleasure which attraction for money provides. Similarly the
bliss that is attained by “Vijfana’ (devotion) is not attained by
‘Jnana’ (knowledge). In ‘Jnana’ there is constant relish but in
“Vijnana’ there is such a relish which goes on increasing every
moment. Therefore while declaring ‘Jiana’ with ‘Vijfiana’, the
Lord specially aims at ‘Vijnana’ and he wants to explain that

it is superior to ‘Jiana’ because ‘Vijnana’ stands for the Lord’s |

entire form. -

that only those persons who do not indulge in the sensuous

of those, men who follow virtues and righteousness, are only

Persons, who have no desire to go to heaven, and to enjoy

past impressions who do not deviate from their principles and -

Worldly pleasures, seem pleasant only in the beginning. If strivers,

worldly pleasure and prosperity. Some people, who transcend
worldly pleasures, run after heavenly pleasures. But, there are

Therefore, the expression 'Manusyanam sahasresu kascidyatati siddhaye' means
‘Manusyanam sahasrani bhagavati rucim kurvanti sahasresu kascit siddhaye yatati
ca'1.e., ‘thousands of men have an inclination to God but one of those thousands :
of men strives to attain perfection.
* Divine perfection does not mean worldly and heavenly enjoyments and
accomplishment such as ‘Anima, Mahima’ and 'Garima’ etc., because they lead to
a downfall and to the cycle of birth and death (9/21). Therefore, here perfection
means God-realization.

| In fact, it is not. difficult to attain, God-realization but there
are oily a few aspirants who strive, sincerely from their heart, to
realize Him. Now, a question arises; why: do not strivers strive

for God-realization? The answer is, that there:are two stumbling
blocks—attraction of sensual pleasures and hope to realize Him,
_ 'Yatatmapi siddhanam'|—Here, ‘Siddha’ (the successful one),
is the striver whose mind has been purified, and whose only
aim, is to realize God. Though (in 7/19) the man of realization
who realizes that all is God, is called a gréat soul, yet in this
context, great souls are those strivers, who possess divine nature,
worship the Lord constantly, with exclusive devotion (Gita 9/13),
and strive to realize Him. ~ nn eT

Here, 'Yatatam' means, that strivers want to realize God,
from their heart and so strive for Divine perfection, and naturally
think of Him, with révérence. _ So -

'Kascinmam vetti tattvatah'—'Scarcely one knows Me in
reality.’ Here it does not mean, that the strivers who strive to _
know Him, cannot know Him. But, at present, anyone striver
out of the assiduous strivers, knows Him in reality; out of those
who know Him, scarcely anyone can speak of Him, and explain
to others. Other learned persons, may be there who may have

* God always pervades everywhere, all persons, things, incidents,
circumstances and actions etc. Therefore, God-realization need not be left for
the future. He is now, here, in everyone and everyone's. Moreover, He is superior
to all the persons etc. By having this belief, mind will be attracted towards Him
automatically and a burning desire to realize Him immediately will be aroused.

+ Here the striver has been called 'Siddha' (successful one) according to
‘Sati-siitra-nyaya’ because he will attain perfection in the same way as a saree will
be prepared of the Sutra (thread). If a striver depending on God, having exclusive
devotion for Him adores Him in order to realize Him, he will attain perfection,
there is no doubt about it. As far as a saree is concerned it may be prepared out of
the thread or even any other cloth may be prepared out of the thread or the thread
may be destroyed. But the devotee who adores God with exclusive devotion will
certainly attain perfection. :
"
862,"Verse 3] : _ SADHAKA-SANJIVANI. 825
knowledge, but they cannot explain to others. The Lord declares, oe
""One looks upon Him, as a marvel; another, likewise speaks of
Him, as a marvel"" (Gité 2/29). : -
Generally, people give illustrations about this verse, )in order /
to explain, that-it is very difficult to attain, Divine perfection.
But actually, it is not so. In order to attain Divine perfection,
it is difficult to -have keen desire and for the fulfilment of that
desire, it is not easy to have the company of liberated souls. |
Here, Lord Krsna says to Arjuna, ""I shall unfold (teach) to you
in full, this knowledge, combined with realization and you will
know it."" Such an omniscient speaker, as Lord Krsna Himself,
and such an inquisitive striver as Arjuna, are very rare. The fact
is, that it is difficult to have keen desire. By having keen desire, -
a striver has no responsibility of his own, the responsibility is _
shouldered by the Lord.
By using ‘tattvatah’ (In truth), Lord Krsna means that a striver |
comes to know the truth (reality), about Him, that He manifests —
Himself in the form of Lord Siva, Ganeéa, Surya (the sun), Visnu,
by incarnations and He is possessed of form and attributes and -
He is also, without form and attributes i.e., he knows that there
is no existence, in the least, besides the Lord.
Appendix—Out of all the God-realized souls who have
attained perfection after striving, following the disciplines of
Karma, Jiiana and Dhyana etc., the devotees, who know the
entire form of God in reality, in the shape of ‘all is God’ are
very rare, indeed (7/19).
*Yatatamapi siddhanam’—those liberated souls, are dissatisfied
with their state of liberation and from within they have a yearning,
a hunger to have supreme devotion (infinite bliss). Therefore
it is mentioned in the Brahmasutra—‘muktopasrpyavyapadesat’
(1/3/2)—‘that God Who is an embodiment of love (devotion) is
realizable (attainable) even by the liberated souls’. The reason
is that by attaining salvation, the desire for the perishable relish
"
863,"826 §RIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 7
is wiped out but the hunger for endless relish is not ‘satisfied.
That hunger is aroused by-God’s grace. It means that those,-who

| practise spiritual discipline by having faith and belief in God,
who have the latent impression of devotion, God:does not let -
them be satisfied with knowledge, does not let them stay there,
and makes the relish of salvation insipid for them. ———
A Karmayogi, a Jhanayogi, a Dhyanayog!, etc.,—all can attain
perfection (salvation) but all of them don’t know God in His entire
form. Therefore the expression ‘yatatimapi siddhanam’ means that
by striving, they have attained perfection with their own method
but they don’t know My entire (full) form. The reason is that
My entire form can be known by supreme devotion—‘bhaktya
mamabhijanati yavanyascasmi tattvatah’ (Gita 18/55), -
 ‘Kaécinmarh vetti tattvatah’—Here the term ‘mam’ stands for -
God in his entire form. The entire form of God can be known
by God’s grace, not by thought (Gita 10/11). Arjuna also after
hearing the gospel of the Gita said to Lord Krsna, “By Your
grace my delusion is destroyed and memory is gained”-——‘nasato
mohah smrtirlabdha tvatprasadanmayacyuta’ (Gita 18/73). As ~
while feeding the cow licks her calf with fondness, it provides
so much nourishment which the calf can’t get only by drinking
milk. Similarly the knowledge which is gained by God’s grace,
can’t be gained by thought because while thinking, the entity
of the self persists. |
-_ He who knows only attributeless God, does not know Him
in reality but he who knows both God endowed with attributes
and also attributeless God (entire) knows God in reality.

By Karmayoga ‘quiet bliss’ (peace) (quietude) is attained
because attachment to the world causes disquietude. By Karmayoga
renunciation of attachment to the world causes peace—
‘tyagacchantiranantaram’ (Gita 12/12). By Jnanayoga ‘unbroken
bliss’ is attained. This unbroken bliss is also called ‘self-bliss’
because it is the bliss of the self. In self-bliss the self merges
"
864,"Verse 3} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 827
into Brahma (Absolute) viz., as Brahma is truth, consciousness
and bliss solidified, similarly the self becomes truth, consciousness
and bliss solidified—‘mama sadharmyamagatah’ (Gita 14/2).
Though having attained the self-bliss (Self-realization) a striver _
lacks nothing, yet the striver, who has the latent impression |
of devotion and depends on God’s grace, is not satisfied with
that self-bliss.* Within him there is hunger for endless bliss.
Therefore by Bhaktiyoga, endless bliss is attained. Self-bliss is
the bliss of the fragment (soul) but endless bliss is the bliss
of the whole (God) (supreme soul). This is the principle that
the pleasure which is caused by the attraction of an object, is
not caused by the knowledge of that object. As the pleasure
which is derived from the greed for money, is not derived
from the mere knowledge of money. By knowing the money
we shall know how to make use of it, but there will not be -
special attraction. ‘Gain more and more money’—this attraction
will persist by being greedy for money. In fact there is no
pleasure in gaining money but it seems because of the evil of
greed, but God’s bliss is because of pure love and this bliss
really exists. The reason is that being a fragment of God, the oe
embodied self has an automatic attraction towards Him. This is
the principle that a fragment is naturally attracted towards the
whole; as a stone being a fragment of the earth when thrown
‘upward naturally 1s attracted towards the earth, fire is naturally
attracted towards the sun (upward)T and rivers naturally flow
towards the sea and so on. |
*He who attains salvation is naturally satisfied, but he who has the
impressions of devotion is not satisfied. The reason is that God showers his special
grace on such a devotee and does not let him stay there. (7/3)
_ [Here a doubt may crop up that the sun does not shine at night, then why
does fire rise upward at night? The clarification is that whether it is day or night,
the sun may shine anywhere but he is always above the earth. Therefore as the
people in India see the sun above the earth, so do the people of America (which
is almost in the opposite direction of India) also see the sun above the earth.
"
865,"828 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
Why do we need God? If we reflect upon it, we come to
| know that there is such a necessity which can’t be satisfied either
by our own self or by the world. In order to alleviate sufferings
and to attain supreme peace, there is no necessity for God. The
reason is that if desires are totally renounced, our sufferings —
will end and Supreme Peace will be attained—‘tyagacchantira-
nantaram’ viz., we shall attain salvation, we have necessity for
God in order to attain Supreme Love because we are fragments
only of God. | |
- The man who wants to be liberated from worldly sufferings,
who wants to be independent, being free from dependence, attains
salvation. But the man, who being tired of the worldly sufferings
thinks, “If there had been anyone my own who would have given -
me refuge in himself, who would have embraced me and who
would have removed my grief, sin, lack, fear and monotony -
etc., attains devotion.” It means that God is not needed to attain
salvation but he is needed to attain devotion. When a man comes
to know that in such a vast world, in endless universes, there
is nothing mine but only He is mine, in Whose one fragment _
endless universes are situated, then he feels the necessity for
God from within. The reason is that only the thing, which ever
stays with us and with which we may ever stay, can be ours.
Only God can be the entity Who may not be separated from us
and from Whom we may not be separated. |
Now the question arises when a man needs God, why is He.
not attained? The answer is that a man lives comfortably without
attaining Him, he forgets his necessity. He remains satisfied with
objects, ability and power etc., which are available to him. If
he realizes the need for God and can be ill at ease, there is no
delay in God-realization. The reason is what should be the delay
in attaining Him Who is ever attained? God is not a tree that
the seed is sown today and it will bear fruit after years. He is
present at all places, all the time, in all things, in all states and
"
866,"Verse 4-5] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 829
in all circumstances the same as He is. We have turned away
from Him, he has not turned away from us.

* The entity which is kaletdoscopic and never remains the same has been
mentioned as perishable (in 15/16), lower (insentient) Nature (in 7/4) and of
twenty-four categories—five subtle elements (ether, air, fire, water and earth), ego,

nature (para prakrti). The lower nature, is inferior, insentient
and changeful, while higher nature is superior, sentient and
changeless. |
Every man's nature, is different. As a man's nature, cannot be
proved to have its own separate entity, independent of that man,
similar is the case with that of God's nature. This nature is God's
own disposition, therefore, it is called as His nature. Similarly,
the embodied soul, being a portion of God, cannot be proved
to have its own separate existence, independent of God, as it is
: God itself: Though God itself, but it is named nature, because
_ Of its affinity with lower nature. As it accepts the activities of
the Lower Nature as its own, or in. other words attributes the
doership to himself, therefore, it is called, superior Nature, or |
embodied soul, otherwise, it is nothing else but God. When it =~
becomes free, from the bondage of being a doer, and an enjoyer
| (Gita 18/17) it is no more higher nature, or embodied soul.
Here the Lower Nature, includes earth, water, fire; air,
ether, mind, intellect and ego. If out of these eight, five gross
elements are supposed to represent the gross creation and the =~
- three, (mind, intellect and ego) are to represent the whole subtle
- creation, then this description of nature, remains incomplete, as
it leaves out the causal creation. To prove that in this description
of nature, all parts of nature, have been included, the venerable
commentators, have interpreted these in the following way.
According to them the five gross elements stand for gross as
well as their causes, five subtle tanmatras, mind stands for its
Origin ego; intellect stands for cosmic intelligence and ‘ego’
_ stands for the causal nature. Thus, this interpretation includes
_ full description, of cosmic nature, as it includes all the three
gross, subtle. and causal creation.
In scriptures, this cosmic nature has been described as prakrti
and vikrti. Here, a point needs attention, that Lord Krsna has not
described lower and higher nature from the view-point, of prakrti
"
868,"Verse 4-5] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 831
and vikrti or Nature-cum its.evolutes. Had the Lord defined so,
He would not have called the individual: soul, as higher nature,
because the soul is neither prakrti—the cause of any evolute nor
vikrti—the evolute itself. The soul is immutable and changeless. It ;
proves, that the Lord, has described matter, as lower nature, and
the individual soul, as higher nature, just in order to distinguish,
the insentient from the sentient. — a ee
_ According to this author, this eightfold division of Nature, |
includes the gross and: subtle, creation only. The five gross
elements enumerated here, include the. gross creation. These five
elements, also represent subtle creation, as these are evolutes of
five subtle tanmatras. Mind, intellect and ego, described here,
are also part of the subtle creation. De -
.. The ego has two aspects. The ego is matter, in its nature, _
and it is a modification, or a.trait of the inner sense @d:%t7),
It is a sort of an instrument. This is called, in the fourth verse,
as ego a. part of lower nature. The second aspect of ego, is
_ one's own personality and it represents itself as a ‘doer’. This
is described, in the fifth verse of this chapter, by the name of 8
higher nature. This ‘ego’, is the result of the soul's identification,
with causal body. _ . |
| This identification, has two aspects—insentient and sentient.
The insentient factor, is the causal body and one who cultivates
egoistic notion, is sentient factor, until Self-realization, this ego
persists assuming itself always, as ‘doer’. During deep sleep, it
lies dormant or is not manifest. After waking up ""I slept soundly
and am awake"", a man making this statement, represents the
ego, the higher-nature. After waking up he thinks, ""where and
how he is"", this is wakefulness. of mind, and when he knows,
that he is at a particular place and time, it is the wakefulness,
of the intellect. Thus, one who experiences his entity, is the ego,
representing higher nature, and through the ego, with which he
experiences, is a trait of the inner sense, it is lower nature.
"
869,"832 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7 |
. When soul, the sustainer and illuminator of this lower
nature—identifies itself, with this nature, it is then called higher
nature, or the embodied soul. This fact, has been described in
Gita by the term‘ aad aria srq’—by whom this insentient Nature,
is sustained. | |
__ If this sentient nature (soul: or spirit), without having: any
inclination for the insentient nature, has an inclination for God
i.e., accepts Him as Its own, it realizes the Self and then its (soul's
or man's) attachment, for the world, turns into love for God.*
This Divine love, is limitless, it is in the form of bliss, and it
increases every moment. After attaining it, nothing else remains
to be attained; and after realizing the Self, nothing remains to
be known and after applying all the objects etc., of the lower
nature for the service of the world, and having disinclination, for _
them, nothing remains, to be done. This is the state of perfection,
of human life. a , | |
'Prakrtirastadha apareyam'—It seems, that this eightfold |
lower nature is individual, lower nature, because a man is bound
because of his affinity for his body. If a man (soul) does not -
accept his affinity for it, there is no question of any bondage.
Man himself (soul or spirit), sustains this universe viz.,.accepts
his relationship with the universe, and that relationship leads
him, to bondage. — SO
An individual body, has no separate entity, different from
the universe. When a man (the self), assumes his affinity for the
body, he is bound. If he does:not assume this affinity, there. is
no question of bondage. =
In the seventh verse of the fifteenth chapter, Lord Krsna
*The striver following the Discipline of Knowledge will have revelation
of love for God in the form of Self-realization while a devotee following the
Discipline of Devotion will have that revelation in the form of Divine love. Thus
from this point of view the striver following the Discipline of Knowledge and
that following the Discipline of Devotion—both become one. |
"
870,"Verse 4-5] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 833
declares, ""The soul in the body, is an eternal fragment of Myself.""
- But it attracts the mind and the senses, that rest in Matter viz.,
it accepts the mind and the senses as its own. In the same way _
in the fifth verse of the thirteenth chapter, Lord Krsna describes |
the universe as Ksetra (field) and, in the sixth verse, describes its
evolutes (modifications). But actually these evolutes are found,
not in the universe, but in the body. Thus, affinity for the body,
is the main obstacle to emancipation. This body, being a fragment
of the universe, cannot be separated from it. =
The fact is, that primordial Matter, is neither a means nor
an obstacle to emancipation. When a striver does not accept
his. affinity for it, it proves helpful. But, when he accepts his
affinity for it, it proves an obstacle, because this affinity for :
prakrti (matter), gives birth to egoism (Tness). This egoism, is _
the cause of bondage. By the phrase ‘Itiyarn me’, Lord Krsna,
warns us that this Primordial Matter or lower nature, is His. So
a striver should not accept it as his own, otherwise this affinity
will lead him, to the cycle of birth and death. __
_ Inegoism (Tness), there are two desires—desire for pleasure, -
as well as desire for knowledge. The desire for pleasure, can
be wiped out by the Discipline of Action, while the desire for
knowledge can be satisfied by the Discipline of Knowledge.
Thus, a striver who 1s firmly established in either of the two, gets
the fruit of both (Gita 5/4-5) i.e., when the desire for pleasure
is wiped out, the desire for knowledge is satisfied. When the
desire for knowledge is satisfied, the desire for pleasures, is
wiped out. When the desire for pleasures is wiped out, or the
desire for knowledge is satisfied, there develops detachment,
automatically. If a striver does not enjoy that detachment 1.e.,
he is not pleased with that state, he attains Self-realization and
his human life, proves fruitful... |
‘Jivabhitam'—<Actually, the soul is a fragment of God, but
by accepting its affinity for physical, subtle and causal bodies,
"
871,"834 | _ §RIMADBHAGAVADGITA.— [Chapter7
it has become an embodied soul. It accepts its affinity, in order
to, enjoy mundane pleasures, which lead It to great affliction,
in the form of birth and death, © Oo :
""Mahabaho'—O: Arjuna, being mighty-armed, you are very ;
brave and powerful and. you can ‘understand the. difference |

Therefore, understand it. — - Ly : Ss
 ""Yayedarn dharyate jagat'*—In fact, this universe is a. |
manifestation of God i.e., all the universe is God (7/19) and
He is being and non-being both-(9/19).. The man (soul); has
sustained this universe i.e., the. man (soul), by accepting the
free existence of this universe, has started using it for his own
pleasure, and thus it has led him to bondage. If he takes this -
universe, as a manifestation or revelation of God, he will be _
free, from the shackles of birth and death. 7 :
The world, is transitory and kaleidoscopic, but man thinks it
permanent and pleasing, because of his temptation and attachment
for pleasure and things, by having feelings of 'T and 'mine’. It
is because of his attachment for pleasure and prosperity, that 7
he cannot behold this world, as a manifestation of God. As a
debouch cannot behold a woman, as mother, so can a person
having attachment for the worldly pleasure and prosperity, not
perceive that the Lord Himself, has manifested Himself, in the
form of the world. This attachment for pleasure sustains the
universe, i.e., 1s the cause of sustaining, the universe. |
Secondly, all human beings, are born of sperm and ovum,
which themselves are filthy and impure. But a voluptuary thinks,
the body as charming and beautiful, because of his attachment
for pleasure. This thought makes the world.
Once a gentleman said to a saint, who was standing on the
bank of a river, ""Sir, the water of this river and the men, on the
*In the Gita the term ‘Jagat’ (universe) denotes higher Nature (in 7/13),
lower Nature (in 7/5) and higher and lower Nature both (in 7/6).

bridge are flowing.” The saint. said, ""O brother, it is not only
the water of the river, or the men that are moving, but the river -
and the bridge themselves, are also moving."" It means, that all |
of these are moving towards, destruction. One day they will .
come to an end. Actually the whole world.is perishing every — 7
moment. In fact, the soul is neither born nor does It decay. But,
by identifying Itself with the body, It accepts the body's birth and
death as Its own, birth and death. If It does not identify itself |
with the body nor does It accept its affinity for it, this world
will have no existence at all. | |

The term 'Idam', means that as both body.and the world 7
are one, and the same, their difference is not real, it is merely .
assumed. Therefore, Lord Krsna, in the thirteenth chapter, says |
that this body is spoken of. as a field (ksetra) (13/1); but where
there is a description of this field, it is a description of the world 7
(13/5), while the evolutes such as desire, aversion, pleasure and
pain etc., have been described part of the individual body (13/6).
It means, that the world and the body are essentially the same. —
If we accept the body as T’, it gives birth to egoism (‘T'ness),
and if we accept the body as ‘mine’, it gives birth to 'mineness'’, ;
and both of these lead to bondage. If we realize, that the body
and the world belong to one and the same class, and the man
himself (soul) and God belong to one class, which is quite
different from that of the body and the world, egoism (‘T'ness)
and 'mineness' perish’ automatically. These can be wiped out,
by the three Disciplines of Action (2/71), Knowledge ( 18/53)
and Devotion (12/13). It means, that the assumed affinity for
matter, should be broken off and it can be, by accepting reality
through discrimination. : :

A teacher and a pupil have their own separate entity or
existence. But by having love and regard for each other, there.
"
873,"836 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
is a further affinity between the two.* Similarly, the soul which
is a fragment of the Lord, has accepted its affinity, with a body
and the world. It is because of this affinity, that there appears to
be a third entity, which is called Tness. This affinity of ‘T'ness, is
merely assumed, not real. But the soul, by accepting it as real, gets .
into bondage. A teacher and a pupil, have a separate existence,
and both of them accept their affinity for each other. But, out of
the soul (sentient) and the world (insentient or matter), only the
soul has Its own existence. By an error it accepts Its relationship
with the world, which is changing and perishing, every moment.
This assumed relationship, is also decaying every moment. But
it seems real to those, who. want to seek pleasure in the world.
It is because of their attachment for worldly pleasures, that a
world, which is never attained, seems to be attained; while God, /
Who is ever attainable seems unattained to them. As soon as,
they are free from this assumed affinity for the world, they will
realize the reality of their affinity—that they have their affinity
for God; and only He, not the world, can be attained.

To wipe out this feeling of ‘I'ness, a striver should have a
firm belief, that he is different from matter, he should not expect =
anything from the world, but perform actions for the service of
the world, because, whatever strength, intelligence and resources
he possesses, he has received from the world. By following,
this Discipline of Action, the direction of actions and objects,
is towards the world and the self, remains, so he attains self-
realization. By following, the Discipline of Knowledge, also by
using discrimination a striver, by breaking off his affinity for
things and actions, of the world, attains self-realization. Thus,
by breaking off his affinity for matter, he becomes free from his
assumed, ‘T'ness. Devotion to God, is aroused in the Discipline
of Devotion, by accepting 'I am only God's, and only God is

* In teacher-taught relationship the duty of the teacher is to do good to the pupil
and the duty of the pupil is to serve the teacher. In the same way every relationship
of the world is to do good to others or serve others without any selfish motive.

mine, I am not of the body, and the world, and the. body and

the world, are not mine’. Then a striver having disinclination for

the world, depends only on God and thus he becomes free from

the affinity of the world, and egoism ('I'ness).

Thus, by following, the Discipline of Action, the Discipline :

of Knowledge, or the Discipline of Devotion, in the right

perspective, a striver, becomes free from the affinity of matter

and realizes, God.
Appendix—When the self gets identified with the lower nature

viz., is identified with ‘ego’ and assumes itself ‘I am’, then by

becoming an embodied soul, it is called higher nature. On one

side of the ‘ego’ (I), there is the world (lower nature) and on

the other side there is God. But the embodied. soul instead of |

accepting God, accepts His lower nature and sustains it in the form

of the world which leads him to the bondage of birth and death. -
‘apareyamitastvanyam’—Different from ‘apara’ (lower) is

‘para’ (higher) and different from ‘para’ is ‘apara’. ‘Apara’ |

is different viz., belongs to another class. By catching

(sustaining) the alien this ‘para’ has become ‘jiva’ (embodied

soul) —‘jivabhitam’. | | :
Apara (kaleidoscopic) and para (unchangeable)—both are

God’s nature viz., power. Being powers of God, both are

identified with God because without the powerful, the power

has no independent existence. As nail and hair, in spite of being

lifeless, are not different from the living body, similarly the lower

nature, in spite of being insentient, is not different from God—-Who

is sentient—-‘sadasaccahamarjuna’ (Gita 9/19). In this way when

‘apara’ and ‘para’—both prakrtis are the embodiments of God,

then what remains besides God? Nothing remains—‘Vasudevah

sarvam’ (Gita 7/19). .
God’s integral form consists of both para and apara nature

meaning that Para, Apara; Sat, Asat; sentient and insentient all

are God. .
"
875,"838 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter7
“Yayedarmh dharyate jagat’. means that this world has no
existence in the eye of God as well as in the eye of an exalted
soul. It exists only in the eye of the individual soul. In the
eye of God ‘Sat’ and ‘Asat’ all is He Himself aaqrareasa
(Gita 9/19) and in the eye of the exalted soul “All is God”
“aged: aay (Gita 7/19). : ee
A man (the embodied soul) because of attachment and |
aversion has sustained the world in his intellect. The same
fact has been pointed out in the seventh verse of the fifteenth
chapter by the expression ‘manah sasthanindriyani prakrtisthani
karsati’. By cognising the existence of the world, attachment
and aversion arise. | : : : oe
The embodied self assumed the existence of the world and .
attached importance to it. By attaching importance, the desire _
for pleasure sprang up which 1n its turn led it to the cycle of -
birth and death. It means that by assuming any other entity
besides God, the being has been snared in the worldly bondage.
Therefore it is the being’s responsibility not to assume any other
entity besides God. If it does not assume the entity of the world,
where is the world? | |
The Lord declares that earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind,
intellect, ego—-these eight constitute ‘apara’ (insentient) prakrti.*
As the earth is insentient and is to be known, so is ego insentient
and is to be known. It means that earth, water etc.—all the
eight belong to the same ‘jati’ viz., class (category)}. Therefore
* If there is one thing common in several things, that is called ‘jati’. Earth,
water, fire, air, ether, mind, intellect and ego—in these eight there is oneness
of ‘jati’ (class) but there is not oneness of form viz., in spite of one class, their
forms are different. Therefore it has been called ‘astadha’ (eightfold). Being the
evolutes of ‘apara prakrti’ (lower nature), here earth, water etc., have been called
‘apara prakrti’. :
+ Earth is gross. Water is more subtle than earth. Fire is more subtle than
water. Airis more subtle than fire. Ether is more subtle than air. Mind is more subtle
than ether. Intellect is more subtle than mind. Ego is more subtle than intellect.
"
876,"Verse 4-5] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI | 839
the class to which the earth belongs, ego also belongs to the
same class viz., ego like a clod is insentient and is objective in
nature. Therefore the Lord has mentioned ‘ego’ as ‘this’—‘etad
yo vetti’ (Gita 13/1). ‘Etat’ (this) is never “aham’ (I). Therefore -
the Lord by saying ‘ego’ as ‘this’ means that ‘ego’ is not ‘the |
self’. When the sentient (self) identifies itself with ‘ego’, then
it gets bound—’ahamhkara vimidhatma kartahamiti manyate’
(Gita 3/27). This is called ‘cijjadagranthi’. 7
‘Ahankara itiyarhn me’—the pure ego is matter (insentient) in
its nature and belongs to the ‘apara prakrti’ (lower nature) but ‘I
am’—this identified ego is not only of ‘apara prakrti’ but it is
conjoined with ‘para prakrti’ (sentient). On Self-realization the
latter ego, which leads to birth and death, does not persist but
the former (ego of apara prakrti) remains. _
‘Actions and objects are neither in ‘para prakrti’ nor
in God but they are in ‘apara prakrti’. “Apara prakrti’ is in
the form of actions and objects. The Lord with the help of
‘Prakrti’? brings into being the whole creation. ‘Para prakrti’
viz., the embodied soul, by being attached to actions and objects -
(Apara prakrti) and depending on them, gets bound. Attachment
to the “Apara prakrti’ and dependence on it means ‘to sustain
the world’. Therefore the Lord at the very. beginning of the
seventh chapter has mentioned—to be attached to Him and to
take refuge in Him by the expression—‘*mayyasaktamanah partha
yogam yunjanmadasrayah’. If a striver (the embodied soul) is
not attached to ‘Apara prakrti’ and does not take refuge in it; he
will attain salvation. If he is attached to (loves) God and takes
refuge in him, he will become a ‘Bhakta’ (devotee).
The world has no independent existence. The soul has
cognised the existence of the world which leads it to bondage.
The soul sustains the world which causes pleasure, pain, bondage
In apara prakrti ego is the most subtle. Thus the Lord has described apara prakrti
from the gross to the subtle in due order.

cause any obstacle but attachment to the modes carries it to the _
higher regions or middle regions or lower regions—‘karanarh
gunasango’ sya sadasadyonijanmasu’ (Gita 13/21). The soul itself
gets attached to the modes. Apara prakrti does not get attached
to anyone. Neither Prakrti nor modes, nor senses; nor mind nor
intellect gets attached. But the embodied soul itself gets attached
and thus it feels pleasure and pain and follows the cycle of birth
and death. The soul is independent because it is ‘para’ viz., the
higher nature. The poor apara prakrti does nothing because it is
insentient and is free from desire. The being getting attached to.
it and making proper use or misuse of it, goes to high (good)
and low (evil) wombs and goes astray. It means that the being __
in spite of being unchangeable, being attached to the changeable
world, becomes the kaleidoscopic world (embodied soul)*
(Gita 7/13). It has an eye on the: body only, it. does not even
think of its divine nature. oe
The self identifies itself with the world viz., with the body,
senses, mind, intellect, ego which is altogether different from
it—-this is sustenance of the world. In fact the world is not
ours, because if we had attained the thing which is ours, our
desires would have ended forever and we would have been free
from mineness, fear, worries and desires. But the world can’t
afford us such a thing which is ours viz., of which there is
never any disunion. The entity which is ours, can’t be attained
by the world but can be attained by renouncing attachment to
the world. Our thing (entity) is God. We are the fragments of
that God—‘mamaivarnso jivaloke’ (Gita 15/7). The method
to attain Him (from the view-point of Karmayoga) is that the
objects (body etc.,) recerved from the world, should be used to
* Here the term ‘Jagat’ stands for the ‘changeable’—‘gacchatiti jagat’.
"
878,"Verse 4-5] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 841
render service to the world without desiring any fruit. A striver
should not be attached to any action or object. It is better not
to harm anyone than to serve them. If we don’t harm anyone
and do not do evil to others, service will be naturally rendered .
to them, we shall have not to render it.* We are not proud of
the action which takes place itself and there is no desire for its :
fruit. Having renounced pride and the desire for fruit we attain
the thing which is really ours. | | |
In fact ‘apara prakrti’ has no separate existence at all
besides God—‘nasato vidyate bhivah’. The individual self has
cognised its (apara prakrti’s) special existence. As money has no
importance of its own but we attach importance to it because
of our greed for it. We are attracted towards the object to a
which we attach importance. We attach importance, when we
accept evil i.e., some faultsT. It is due to the evil of lust for ~
sex, there is attraction for woman; because of the evil of greed
there is attraction for money; because of the evil of delusion,
there is attraction for family and so on, But when we identify
ourselves with those evils, we don’t perceive those evils as
evils and we don’t know that we, by assuming their (apara -
prakrti’s) existence, are attaching importance to them. When
this identification is wiped out, evils stay no more in us and
* If we don’t do evil to others, there will be two things—either we shall do
nothing, or if we do, only service will be rendered. By doing nothing and by serving
others—by these two things, attachment to the world is renounced. The reason is
that by doing nothing, no evil is done and by the service which is rendered itself
to others all evils are wiped out. As while eating food a man holds ‘I eat’—thus
the pride which is attached is not attached in the digestion of food because food
is digested itself. Similarly when service is rendered itself, the pride of doership
and attachment to the fruit of action, are naturally renounced.
TAll the worldly pleasures are born of evils. When we accept evils, they
seem to provide pleasure. Because of the lust for sex a man can’t live without
woman. Because of greed a man can’t live without wealth. Because of delusion
a man can’t live without family. It is because of evils that a man can’t perceive
the value of renunciation.

‘apara’. But he who sees, hears, studies, thinks, knows, assumes __ -

inseparable from God viz., they are the manifestations of God. __
Therefore in the inside and outside of endless universes and
in the form of infinite universes, there is nothing else. besides
God—‘vasudevah sarvam’ (7/19), ‘sadasaccahamarjuna’ (9/19).
All the philosophies and diverse opinions of the world have been ;
propounded .by-their heads (acaryas) but “Vasudevah sarvam’ is
not the philosophy or opinion of a particular ‘acarya’ (head) but
it is the irreversible principle of Lord Krsna within which all
philosophies and diverse opinions are included. 7
_. The individual self has assumed the independent existence
of :the . ‘apara’  (world)-—‘yayedath ‘dharyate jagat’. ‘Apara’ is
God’s but this self is bound because it has assumed ‘apara’ viz..,
body-senses-mind-intellect-ego its own and for itself. Therefore
if a striver perceives (sees) the world, it is his personal view.
The personal view is not a principle. Whatever is seen is limited
while the ‘Reality’ is limitless. As the sun appears like a metallic
dish, but actually it is not of the size of a metallic dish but it is
several times bigger than the earth. Oo 7
If the world is in cognizance of a striver, he should serve

it in a disinterested manner. The assumption that the world is
his and for him-and also. the tendency to derive pleasure out :
of it, is anti spiritual discipline and is the cause of bondage.
The reason is.that the body-senses-mind-intellect etc., whatever
we have, 1s of the world and for the world. Therefore if the
things received from the world, are used in rendering service |
to the world, the world will not appear as the world but it
will be seen as the manifestation of God, which really it. is.
It means whether a striver assumes the world as true or the
self as true or God as true, by anyone of the assumptions, |
he can practise spiritual discipline and can attain the final
reality ‘Vasudevah sarvam’. |

'Etadyonini bhitani’'—All the beings—gods, men, animals,
birds etc., which move and also trees, creepers and grass etc.,
which do not move, have their origin, in the union of My
insentient and sentient Nature.
In the twenty-sixth verse of the thirteenth chapter also, the
Lord declares, ""Whatever being, moving or unmoving is bom;
know that, as emanated from the union of Ksetra (matter) and
"
881,"844 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
Ksetrajna (spirit)."" The same fact has been pointed out, in the
fourth verse of the fourteenth chapter, when He declares, ""My
prakrti (nature) (primordial matter), is the womb of the bodies

of creatures and the soul (seed), which resides in those bodies, __
is My fragment."" The same seed or soul, has been called His |
higher (sentient) Nature (7/5), and His eternal portion (15/7).

‘Sarvanityupadharaya'—In the universe all the moving and |
unmoving creatures, are born of the union of the sentient and the
insentient nature (matter). It means, that soul has accepted matter,
as its own, and keeps its company, and so beings are born—So
think of this fact i.e., understand it in the right perspective, or
accept it. |

‘Aham krtsnasya jagatah prabhavah - pralayastatha'—All
objects emanate from God, and again dissolve in Him. So the —
Lord declares, ""I am the origin of the entire creation, and again
it dissolves in Me."" |

The Lord, is the source of entire creation because, creation
comes into existence, by His will* (Chandogya. 6/2/3). As a
potter, makes earthenwares and a goldsmith makes ormaments -
of gold, so does the Lord create this world. Thus, like a potter
and a goldsmith, He is an efficient cause, of this world.

The universe, again dissolves in Him. As an earthen vessel

_ is of clay, it was clay in the past, before it was moulded into
this shape and will remain clay, when the vessel is broken into
pieces. Similarly, the creation is born of the Lord, resides in Him
and merges (dissolves) in Him. Thus, he is the material cause
of this creation. This is knowledge. The realization, that in the
world there is nothing besides the manifestation of the Lord, is
Vijiiana (real knowledge of Manifest Divinity).

*There is a fact which needs attention that only Ksetrajfia (spirit), not
Ksetra (Matter) has accepted this affinity. If it does not accept this affinity, it can't |
be reborn because, ""Attachment to these Gunas (modes) is the cause of his birth
in good and evil wombs"" (13/21). |
"
882,"Verse 6] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 845

In the expression 'Krtsnasya jagatah', Lord Krsna declares.
Himself to be the origin of entire creation, and also its dissolution.
Here it is appropriate for Him, to talk of Himself as the origin
and dissolution of Matter (insentient Nature). But how is the :
origin of soul (sentient or higher nature) and its dissolution,
possible? The soul is eternal, omnipresent, immovable, constant
and everlasting (Gita 2/24), while the world is ever-changing. But, .
here the word ‘creation’ denotes, both the lower nature (matter)
and higher nature (Soul). The reason is, though the soul is eternal,
changeless and constant, yet It identifies Itself with perishable
matter and thus accepts its (insentient's) creation and dissolution
as Its (sentient's) own creation and dissolution. So, the soul is ;
said to be born and decayed. Therefore, Lord Krsna, has declared .
Himself to be the origin of the entire creation and also its end. ~
Thus, within creation, (i.e.,) all the moving, unmoving; sentient, |
insentient beings, will be included. Moreover, Lord Krsna, in
the thirteenth verse of this chapter, declares, ""The whole of this
creation, being deluded by objects evolved from the three modes
of nature, does not know Me.” Only the sentient can know Him. ;
Therefore the term ""Jagat"" (universe), includes both matter (the
insentient), as well as soul (the sentient).

In the eighth verse of the sixteenth chapter, according to men
of demoniacal traits, the universe includes both insentient and
sentient beings, because they accept all beings, not only insentient
ones, as unreal. If the term ‘Jagat’ (universe), is interpreted as
only matter, the followers of non-dualistic principles, who accept _
the universe as unreal, untrue and baseless, will be included,
among men of demoniacal traits, which is totally improper and
unjustified. Similarly, in the twenty-sixth verse of the eighth
chapter, there is description of the two paths, the bright and the
darkness of the world. But the paths, can be followed by the
sentient only. The sentient, by identifying with matter, is called
‘Jagat’ (world or universe). _
"
883,"846 . SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA ‘({Chapter7
_.. Thus, we conclude that soul by identifying Itself with
Matter, is called embodied soul (world or universe). But, when |
having disinclination for Matter, it realizes its identity, with pure
consciousness (God), this individual soul becomes, the Cosmic
Soul. Such a person is called a Yogi. | |
Appendix—The ‘Apara prakrti’ is that which may know neither
(to) itself nor others. The ‘Para Prakrti’.1s that which may know
itself and also others. All beings moving and unmoving are born
by. the union of the two—apara and para (Gita 13/26).

this evil is wiped out, all evils will be wiped out. Similarly .
_ the basic virtue is also one which reveals all virtues and that -
is—attachment to God. |
We may assume ‘apara’ eternal or transient but our relationship
with it is transient-—this is a unanimous fact. This attachment to
this apara is the cause of birth and death—‘karanarh gunasango’sya

“I am the origin of the entire creation and again it dissolves

‘because besides Me there is no other cause or effect of this
world (Gita 7/7) viz., Iam its instrumental cause and I am its

Lord Krsna, in the second verse of this chapter, announced
that He would unfold in full, the knowledge (wisdom) along
with real knowledge of the manifest Divinity (Vijfiana), having :
known which, nothing else would remain to be known. But, here
He declares, that there is no other origin of the universe, besides
Him. In both the verses, by using, the expression ‘Na anyat' (No
anything), He means that, when there is nothing besides Him,
how can anything else remain, to be known after knowing Him? ;
Therefore, Lord Krsna says, ""All this is threaded (strung) on Me""
and further, He declares ‘All is God' (7/19) and 'I am being and 7
non-being both’ (9/19). The effect, has no independent entity,
except its cause. The cause, only is manifest in its effect. When
the cause, is realized (known), the effect, merges in the cause.
It means that the effect has no separate identity from the cause.
Similarly, it can be realized, that God is the cause and the world, -
is the effect. Hence, the world has no separate entity from God.
This is God-realization. Actually, it is He who manifests Himself
in different forms i.e., this universe is nothing besides, Divine
manifestation. Thus a striver, will come to know that the entire
universe, is His manifestation. ,
""Mayi sarvamidam protarh siitre manigana iva'—'""The. whole
universe, like clusters of yarn-beads formed by knots on a string,

nothing else, besides the Lord. As the beads and thread, though
being one and the same, seem different, all the beings having
different shapes and names, seem to be different, but actually,
it is all Divine manifestation. Lord Krsna, in the second verse

that His lower nature in the form of beads, is His own self and
His higher nature in the form of thread, is also His own self. He
pervades both the two. So long as, a striver attaches importance
to the world, he cannot realize God, Who pervades everywhere,
in this universe. But, when one comes to know the reality, he
realizes that He and only He pervades, everywhere, and there
is nothing else, besides Him. To stress the fact, that all things
are pervaded only by God, the Lord has described Himself, as
the cause of all manifestations. |

spheres and eighty-four lac forms of life etc., is divided into
infinite forms and infinite groups.

"" The distinction between Apara and Para is because of the
Apara prakrti, as the soul by assuming the existence of the Apara,
by valuing it and by establishing relationship with it, has become
the embodied soul (fifth verse of this chapter). Therefore Apara
prakrti is there in the world as well in the embodied soul. But
in God there is neither Apara, nor Para; nor the world nor the
embodied soul. It means that there is neither thread nor beads
but only cotton is there. Similarly there is neither apara nor para
but there is only God. The same fact has been described by the
Lord ahead upto the twelfth verse. From the term ‘mattah’ used
"
887,"850 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA == Chapter?
in this verse upto the expression ‘matta eva’ used in the twelfth
verse, the Lord has mentioned this fact that there is nothing else
besides Him. Here the term ‘mattah’ denotes entiré God (God in
full) Who is the owner of both prakrtis—Para and Apara.

The cause changes into effect; as cotton is changed into
thread and the seed grows into a plant. Therefore God being:
the Supreme cause of all, only He manifests Himself in all
forms—‘Vasudevah sarvam’. Therefore it is a misperception to
see any other entity besides God.

‘Mattah paratararh nanyatkificidasti,—He who is better
(superior) of the two is called ‘paratara’. God is unique
(unparalleled), besides Him there is nothing else, then how can
He be ‘paratara’ (superior to anyone)? The term ‘paratara’ does :
not apply to Him. Here the term ‘paratara’ has been used in order =—s—
to mention the uniqueness of God. It means that there is nothing
else besides God and therefore there is no question of anyone
being superior to Him. In the Upanisad it is mentioned— |

“There is nothing else besides that Purusa. He is the Highest
limit and the Supreme destination of all.” Arjuna while addressing

Comment:— : |
[Generally people attach a lot of importance to money.
So, greedy people have a natural inclination to earn money and
accumulate it. Similarly, by accepting the fact that the Lord is
the source of the entire creation (7/6), there is no existence of
the creation besides the Lord. By accepting this fact, a striver has
his natural inclination, towards Him without making any effort..
The same fact, has been pointed out by the Lord, in the eighth
verse of the tenth chapter, when He declares, ""I am the source of | -
the creation, all things evolve from Me. Knowing this, the wise
adore Me, with all their heart."" In the forty-sixth verse of the
eighteenth chapter, He declares, ""He from whom the evolution
of all beings is, by whom all this is pervaded, worshipping Him
through the performance of his own duty, man attains perfection."" -
Here the same principle is explained further. ]
'Raso'hamapsu kaunteya'—'O son of Kunti! I am sapidity
in water’. Water emanates, from a subtle form of sapidity, (rasa
tanmatra)* it remains in it and it merges in it. If the taste is
removed from water, water cannot remain water. _
‘Prabhasmi §Sasistiryayoh'—""I am radiance (light), in the
* The causes of the five gross elements—earth, water, fire, air and ether are
respectively smell, taste, form, touch and sound which are called five Tanmatra
(seeds). These five seeds can't be known by senses and mind but they are only
assumed by hearing the scriptures. The evolutes of these five seeds are also smell,
taste, form, touch and sound which can be known by senses and mind.
TIn subtle element fire there are two powers—radiance (brilliance) and
combustion (burning). Radiance is called ‘Prabha’ and combustion is known as
""Teja’. The power of radiance can function without the power of combustion as in
gems and the moon, but the power of combustion can’t function without radiance.
Here in this verse there is predominance of radiance while in the ninth verse of
"
889,"852 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
moon and the sun."" Without radiance the moon and the sun,
will lose their essence.
""Pranavah sarvavedesu'—""I am the syllable Om, in all the
Vedas."" First of all, there was revelation of the syllable Om. It
was from this sacred syllable Om, that Gayatri was revealed and ~
it was from Gayatri, that the Vedas were revealed. Therefore,
the gist of the Vedas, is the sacred syllable Om. |
‘Sabdah khe'—Ether, emanates from the subtle element, sound, __
it remains in it and merges in it. Therefore, sound manifests
itself as ether. Without sound, ether is meaningless.
'Paurusamh nrsu’—""I am manliness in men."" It is not enough
for a man to possess the human body, in order to gain worldly
_ riches, knowledge, name and fame etc., but all these are perishable. :
The real man, is he who has attarned God-realization, the ultimate
aim of human life. God existed in the past, exists now and will __
also exist, in future, because He is eternal. Therefore, a man's
‘Purusartha’ exertion consists in making efforts with promptness
and zeal, to realize God. Without attaining Him, human life is,
in vain. |
Appendix—In the sixth and seventh verses the Lord has
mentionéd that He is the cause of the entire creation. Therefore
now the Lord describes His divine glories in the form of ‘cause’
from the eighth verse to the twelfth verse. Though the effect has
special characteristic which is not found in the cause, yet the
cause has its independent existence viz., without cause the effect
has no independent existence. As earth (clay) is the cause and
Jar 1s its effect. Water can be filled in a jar but this characteristic
is not found in the earth. But without earth (clay) a jar has
no independent. existence. It means that the cause is changed
this chapter there is predominance of the power of combustion. So there the
term 'Teja' has been used. |
The sun and fire possess both of these powers while in the moon there is
only radiance, and instead of combustion there is mildness. |
"
890,"Verse 9] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 853
into effect. In making a jar, the doer, the material (cause) and
the effect—the three are not one viz., the cause (clay) and the
effect (jar) are of one class but the doer (potter) has his different
(independent) existence. But in creating the universe the doer,
the material and the effect—these three are only God. Therefore .
sapidity is also God and water is also God. Radiance is also
God and the moon and the sun are also God. ‘Or’ is also God
and the Veda is also God. Sound is also God and ether is also |
God. Manliness is also God and man 1s also God.

[The earth is changed into the form of a jar but God does
not change into the form of the world. The reason is that the
thing which is changed is mutable while God is immutable. As.
in the dark a string (rope) appears in the form of a snake or
the snake appears in the form of a coil, similarly God appears :
in the form of the world. It means that in God there is no -
distinction of effect and cause because there is nothing besides
Him. There is a distinction between the cause and the effect
from the man’s point of view. Therefore in order to explain it
to men, by assuming the existence of some other thing or the
other, God is described, discussed, considered and reflected upon -
and there are questions and answers etc., on Him—‘nodyam va
pariharo va kriyatarh dvaitabhasya. ]

element, smell, stays with it, and merges in it. The earth, is of
no importance without pure fragrance, fragrance is a characteristic
_ of earth. So, the Lord declares, ""I.am pure fragrance in earth.”
The Lord, uses the objective ‘punya’ (pure) in order to explain
that naturally there is pure fragrance in the earth. But bad smell
is produced, because it becomes polluted. ©
- 'Tejascasmi vibhavasau'—Combustion is born of subtle |
element, fire, is inherent in it, and at the end, ‘Merges in it.
Therefore, in fire combustion is the. essence. In fire, if there is
no combustion it is useless. So the _Lord is that combustion.
‘Jivanarhn sarvabhiitesu'—Lord Krsna declares, ""I am life, in
all beings."" All beings possess. life-power, by which they .are
alive. It 1s because of that power, that man even in sound sleep,
remains different from adead man. | :
""Tapascasmi tapasvisu'—Endurance, in the pairs of opposites, is  ~
called austerity.(tapa). But real austerity, is that in which a striver
remains uniform (unchanged), unaffected in difficulties, which
he has to face, in realizing God. This austerity, is an invaluable
possession, of ascetics. Without austerity, they cannot be called
ascetics. So Lord Krsna declares, ""I am, austerity in ascetics."" __
Appendix—In the creation of the universe God is the agent
(doer), God is the cause and God is the effect. Therefore smell |
and earth, lustre (combustion) and fire, life-power and. beings,
austerity and ascetic—all of them (cause and effect) are only
God. The reason is that Para and Apara—both being the power
of God are inseparable from. Him. Therefore the entire universe
which is born by the union of Para and Apara is only the
manifestation of God. ee |
*Punyo gandhah’—‘Gandha-tanmatra’ (smell-subtle element)
is the cause and earth is its effect. By calling the smell pure the
Lord means to say that the cause (tanmatra) is ever pure. Impurity
is caused by alteration (modification) in the effect. Therefore as
fragrance tanmatra is pure, similarly sound, touch, colour and .

O Partha, I am the eternal seed (source), of all beings. All of _
them, are born of Me, Who am their seed, they live in Me and

A seed, grows out of a tree and it perishes, after creating a
tree. But the seed, described in this verse, is eternal without its -
origin and end. In the eighteenth verse of the ninth chapter, it
has been called an 'Imperishable seed’. Remaining imperishable
and unaltered, this eternal seed, is the source, producer, resort
and illuminator, of the entire universe.
In the Gita, the word ‘seed’, has been used, both for God and
the embodied soul. In this verse, 'Seed’ denotes God, because
here, the divine glories have been described. In the thirty-ninth |
verse of the tenth chapter also, the word ‘seed’ denotes, God
because there, Lord Krsna declares, ""I am the seed of all beings.""
In the eighteenth verse of the ninth chapter also, this word has
* In the sixth verse of this chapter Lord Krsna used the term 'Upadharaya’
(know) and here he uses the term 'Viddhi' (know). It means that he wants to say
that the striver should understand, know and accept the fact that the universe is
nothing besides the Divine manifestation.
"
893,"856 =—=—~—«CSSRIMADBHAGAVADGITA =—SSS—SCs[Chhapter7
been used for God, because, in the nineteenth verse of that
chapter, Lord Kysna says, ""I am being and non-being both.” In
the fourth verse of the fourteenth chapter, the.term ‘seed’, stands
for embodied soul. The seed, signifies the embodied soul, only
when, it has accepted Its affinity for matter (nature), otherwise
itis asupersoul(God),
""Buddhirbuddhimatamasmi'—""I am the intelligence, of the

-'Tejastejasvinamaham'—The Lord, is the glory of the glorious.
This glory is a divine trait. Liberated souls, possess a special
_ aura, which enables even dissolute and immoral persons, to
become virtuous. 7 ;
God, is the origin of the whole universe. He always
pervades, everywhere. He exists, even when the entire universe
perishes. In the universe, there is nothing besides God. Therefore,
in the Upanisads (parts of different branches of Vedas), there ~
_ are illustrations of gold, clay and iron. As in ornaments, made
of gold, there is nothing besides gold, in the pots made of clay
there is nothing besides clay and in the arms and weapons made
of iron, there is nothing besides iron. Similarly, in the entire
universe which is born of God, there is nothing besides, God. In
the Gita Lord Krsna, has given the illustration of a seed. A seed,
is born of ‘a tree and after giving birth to a tree, it perishes. But,
- God is not an ordinary seed, He is an eternal seed (7/10) and an
imperishable one (9/18). It means, that unlike an ordinary seed
which after creating another tree, perishes, He does not perish,
He remains the same. . |
Gold, clay and iron, are seen with physical eyes, in ornaments,
earthenwares and arms respectively, but God is not seen in the
world. So the seed too is not seen in a tree. When a tree sprouts
"
894,"Verse 10] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 857
the seed in the form of fruit, then we come to know that the
tree is born of that particular seed, though the tree grows out
of a seed and ends in a seed. Similarly, God, is the seed of the :
entire universe, This universe is born of Him, and merges in |
Him. In the end only God remains (Srimadbhagavata 10/3/25).
Those, who see only the tree and the world instead of the seed
and God, do not observe in the right perspective. It is only, He =
Who reveals Himself, in various forms (Chandogya. 6/2/3).

The universe, including a body, is made of five subtle
elements—earth, water, fire, air and ether, but it so appears only
if we think over it deeply otherwise not. If we-say that these
physical bodies, are made of earth because there is predominance
of earth-element, people without a deep thought, do not believe,
because they say that bodies are different from earth (clay) with -
which they wash hands. But if the entire universe is burnt to
ashes, nothing will remain, besides earth (clay).

If we think deeply, we come to know that a body, is born
of the parents’ sperm and ovum, which arise from corn (grain), |
grown out of earth. Thus a body is said to be born of earth. In -
the end, it merges in earth. After death a body is either buried,
or burnt or eaten by animals and birds. In either case it returns,
into earth. Thus, the origin and end of a body, is earth. It means,
that its middle, is also earth, though it is not seen with physical
eyes but it can be conceived by thought. Similarly, by thinking
seriously, the world can be perceived, as a manifestation of the
Lord. In the entire universe, there is nothing else besides the Lord.
Having created the universe (the bodies), He has also entered it
(Taittiriyopanisad 2/6). He, as the self (soul) also abides in these
bodies. Thus the entire universe is His manifestation.

Appendix—The Lord’s purpose in calling Himself the seed
of all beings is that all beings are His manifestation. There are —
infinite universes and in those universes—there are endless beings.
But the seed of those endless beings is only God. In spite of the
"
895,"858 _ $RIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
creation of endless universes, there is no diminution in that seed,
because that seed is not subject to diminution (Gita 9/18). With
that one seed several kinds of universes are born (Gita 10/39).
We may scan the seed with a keen sight (subtle sight) yet the
fruit, flowers and leaves will not be visible in it because they are ~
latent in that seed in their causative form. Even the two leaves
born of the same tree, are not similar—Even this diversity. is
present in that seed. OO | oo,
There are several kinds of a thing in the universe. In different
countries there are several castes (classes) of human beings. In
their bodies there is so much difference that even the lines of
the thumbs of two men are not similar. Their shapes, natures,
interests, temperaments, assumptions and feelings etc., are also _
different. There are several.kinds of cows, buffaloes,.sheeps,
goats, horses,.camels and dogs etc., and in each kind (class) ~
there are several sub-classes. Among trees also each kind of
tree has several classes. Similarly there are endless. differences
. in each kind of knowledge (art). There are three main colours _

and by their mixture several colours are formed. Out of them in
each colour there are so many differences that two men don’t ~
perceive a colour similarly. Thus in the universe any two things,
which appear similar, are not really similar. In spite of so much
diversity, the seed of the universe is only one. It means that
God alone manifests Himself in numberless forms and in spite
of manifesting Himself in different forms He remains one.*

God is endless from all viewpoints such as place and time

*In spite of diversity among beings, there should be the unity of love among
them. As a thorn pricks the foot but the eyes are filled with tears, the same feeling
for the welfare of others should prevail among all beings—‘sarvabhitahite ratah’
(Gita 5/25, 12/4). Only love is the feeling which knows no distinction. There
can’t be any distinction in love. All become one in love. In knowledge there is
no difference in reality but differences in opinions persist. In love there is no
difference in opinions. Therefore there is nothing beyond love. By love even the
Lord of the three worlds becomes submissive to the will of the lover.
"
896,"Verse 11] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 859
etc. When even the universe created by God is endless (limitless), 7
how can a limit be set to God? Upto this day whatever has
been thought of, whatever has been said, whatever has been
written, whatever has been assumed about God, even if all this :
is combined, it remains incomplete about Him. Not only this
even God Himself can’t describe the full details about Himself,
if He is able to describe it, how will He remain endless?

O Arjuna, I am the strength of the strong without their desire

Comment:— | |
""Balam balavatam caham kamaragavivarjitam'—The strength,
free from desire and attachment, utilized on noble and holy cause |
and sanctioned by scripture and saints, gets sanctified and therefore
the Lord declares, ""I am the strength of the strong, free from |
desire and attachment."" This strength is acceptable.
Lord Krsna Himself, has explained that the strength possessed
of attachment and desire, should be abandoned (17/5) because
it is a demoniacal trait. Similar, is the case with strength used
in 16/14, 16/18 and 18/53. In 6/34, it has been used as an
adjective for mind, and it is a demoniacal trait, because it also
possesses, attachment and desire. Thus, such strength (power), is
to be abandoned. But, strength free from desire and attachment,
as explained in 7/11 as well as in 17/8, is sanctified strength,
which is acceptable.
""‘Dharmaviruddho bhiitesu kamo'smi bharatarsabha'—""I am

righteous passion approved by the scriptures.” Desire, free from
attachment and pleasure* is laudable, because it helps in producing
offsprings and it remains under control of man. But sexual desire,
possessed of attachment and pleasure, misguides aman, enables.
him to perform actions, against dictates of scriptures and leads _
him to afflictions, sins and degradation. |

People who, by using birth-control methods, indulge in.
sexual intercourse for sensual pleasure, pave their way to hell.
Men and women, in the true sense of the terms, are those
who have the-capacity to produce children, otherwise they are

| impotent. An eunuch, is not authorized to perform religious

rites, such as religious sacrifice and offer water and food etc.,
to manes. A woman, is called a mother, because she gives birth —
to children, who call her mother. If the potentiality of generating -
children is destroyed,. she no more deserves to be addressed as
‘Mother'—a very venerable vocative. Therefore, strivers should
have sexual desire to produce children, according to ordinance
of the scripture, in order to lead a pious family life, or they
should observe celibacy. . | -

Appendix—tThe entire moving universe is born of passion.
Therefore a man’s passion not conflicting with righteousness
and which is approved by the scriptures, is the manifestation
of God. The Lord has already declared—“mattah paratararm
nanyatkificidasti” (7/7) (there is nothing else besides Me) and
further He will declare—“ye caiva sattvika bhava” (7/12) (all
entities born of sattva, rajasa and tamasa are evolved from Me)
and ‘Vasudevah sarvam’ (7/19) (all is God). Therefore just as
righteous desire is the manifestation of God, similarly unrighteous
passion is also not different from God. Those who act being
guided by unrighteous desires, pave the way to hells in the forms

* Here the desire stands for the desire of the householders sanctioned by the
scriptures rather than the desire which has been mentioned as the most sinful in

of God because hells are also God only. But the aim of the Gita
is not to lead a man to hell or to the cycle of birth and death
but is to lead him to the attainment of salvation. The aim is
ever for salvation or bliss, not for sufferings. No one wants pain
(suffering). Arjuna has also entreated Lord Krsna to tell him the
highest good for him.* For example, words are good and also
bad, but in grammar only the good words are reflected upon,
because grammar etc., also aim at a man’s salvation. .

'Ye caiva sattvika bhava rajasaéstamasasca ye'—It means,
that in the entire universe, all the Gunas (attributes of things
and actions) evolve from God. He is. the root, support, base
and illuminator of all of these. Whatever, singularity is seen
in the entire universe, that is the Lord's. So, a man should
have inclination towards Him, rather than, towards the mode
of goodness etc. This inclination towards God, will lead him to
emancipation, while inclination towards the mode of goodness
etc., will lead him to bondage.
Actually all the objects, attributes (modes) and actions, are

‘yacchreya etayorekam tanme bruhi suniscitam’ (Gita 5/1)
"
899,"862 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
nothing else, besides the manifestation of the Lord. Now a question
arises, when every action is a manifestation of the Lord, why
is there, sanction or prohibition for these? The answer is, that
actions which are sanctioned by scriptures, result in favourable
and happy circumstances, while actions which are prohibited :
(forbidden), result in unfavourable and sad circumstances. So, if a
person performs forbidden actions, regarding these as manifestation
of the Lord, the Lord as a result of those actions will manifest
Himself, in the form of punishment and hell.

As far as actions are concerned, a striver should perform
only those actions, which are sanctioned by the scriptures. As far
as, acceptance (assumption) and knowledge, are concerned, one
should accept that God exists and he should know the self or 7
the world. By assuming the existence of God, he should develop
a keen desire to attain Him. He should try to please Him, by -
obeying Him and by following His principles. He should also know
that bodies and the universe, are kaleidoscopic and perishable,
and these are neither his nor meant for him. By knowing this
fact, he should cease attachment for them. By doing so, he will
realize the reality. But, even after knowing the fact that they are ;
perishable, if a striver, attaches importance to them, he will not
be able to attain emancipation.

‘Matta eveti tanviddhi'—All are evolved from the Lord viz.,
He is all in all; the cause and the effect, which seems distinct.
But, the effect has no separate and independent existence, from
the cause. Therefore, the effect is a manifestation of the cause,
only. As in ornaments made of gold, there is nothing else, besides
gold, similarly the universe evolved from God is nothing else,
besides God.

By using the phrase ‘Matta eva’ Lord Krsna, means that
His lower nature and higher nature, are not different from Him.
As an appendix to the seventh chapter in the ninth chapter,
Lord Krsna declares, ""Through My nature, I bring forth again
"
900,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 863
and again, all this multitude of beings"" (9/8) and further, He
declares, ""With Me as the supervisor, nature brings forth, the
whole creation"" (9/10). Actually, both of the declarations, are
one and the same. In both the cases, there is predominance of
God. The same fact, has been pointed out here in 7/6. ""I am the -
source and the end of the entire universe."" While concluding it,
He declares, ""Whatever entities there are born of sattva, rajas
and tamas, know them all, as evolved from Me."" |
The Lord, having promised to discuss knowledge and
realization, started the topic by mentioning that among thousands, -
one scarcely knows Him, in truth. Then having explained His
higher and lower natures, He mentioned these as the source
of all beings. Then, He explained that He, is the source of the -
universe (7/7). The same fact, has been pointed out here, while
concluding the topic of His divine glories, when He declares ~
""Know that the sattva (mode of goodness), the rajas (mode of
passion) and the tamas (mode of ignorance), are evolved from Me.”
'Na tvaharn tesu te mayi'—""I am not in them, and they are
not in Me."" It means, that those attributes have no independent
existence of their own, besides the Lord. All actions, objects, ;
are born and then they decay. If the Lord, had been in them,
with their decay He would have also decayed. But, He never
decays. It means, that He is not in them. If they had been in
Him, they should have also been imperishable, like Him. But it
is not so, they perish, while He is eternal. It means, that they are
not in Him. As a seed, takes the shape of a tree with its branches,
leaves, flowers etc., but these cannot be perceived in it, similarly,
nature, constituted of the three categories (modes)—-sattva, rajas
and tamas has origin in Him, but He is not perceived, in them.
Actually, there is nothing else, besides Him.
As clouds evolve from ether, reside in ether and dissolve
in ether, yet ether, remains the same, without any modification.
All the divine glories, described from the eighth verse upto this
"
901,"864 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
verse, evolve from the Lord, reside in Him and dissolve in Him.
But He is not in them and they are not in Him i.e., they are
nothing else, besides Him. The Lord by pointing out this fact,
wants to wam people, that they should not be entangled in
worldly pleasures and prosperity, because there is nothing else,
besides Him. So they should attach importance, only to Him.

All the entities born of sattva, rajas and tamas, are born of
God's nature and as God and His Nature, are one and the same:
It means, that they are born of God and they dissolve in Him.
But, the higher nature (embodied soul), has accepted its affinity
with Nature (Matter). It has accepted it as its own, and for its -
own—this is sustaining the world by an embodied soul and so -
it is born and it decays. In order to, free man from this bondage
of birth and death, Lord Krsna declares, that all entities born of

_ §attva, rajas and tamas are born of Him. Similarly, He declares,

in the tenth chapter, ""These diverse feelings of creatures, emanate
from Me alone"" (10/5) and ""I am the source of all creation .
and everything in the world, moves because of Me"" (10/8). In
the fifteenth chapter also He declares: ""Memory, wisdom and
ratiocinative faculty emanate from Me"" (15/15). When everything
emanates from God, it means that man actually has no affinity
for the attributes (modes). Therefore, if one does not accept his
affinity for them, they cannot lead him to bondage i.e., to the
cycle of birth and death. | |

In the Gita, in the context of devotion also, Lord Krsna
declares, that He is all—""I am being and non-being both"" (9/19) _
and Arjuna also says, to Lord Krsna, ""You are being (existent)
and non-being (non-existent) both, and also beyond, both of
them” (11/37). Lord Krsna also, declares about a devotee having
exclusive devotion ""Such a devotee realizes, that all this is God""
(7/19). A devotee having exclusive devotion, like a chaste wife
"
902,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 865
who perceives only her husband, and thinks of no other man
even in dream, beholds nothing else besides, God.

In the Discipline of Knowledge, the Lord declares, the real
and unreal, as separate entities. ""The unreal has no existence,
and the real never ceases to be"" (2/16). Similarly, matter (nature)
spirit, and Ksetra (field) —Ksetrajiia (knower of the field) are
described in the Gita, time and again, as “Know matter and spirit
to be both, without beginning"" (13/19); ""The knowledge of Ksetra |
(field or matter) and ksetrajiia (spirit), is true knowledge"" (13/2);
""Whatever being, is born, the unmoving or the moving know it,
as emanated from the union of Ksetra (Matter) and Ksetrajfia 7
(spirit) (13/26); 'Ksetrajiia (the Lord of the Ksetra viz., spirit),
illumines the whole Ksetra (field or matter) (13/33); ""Those -
who perceive with an eye of wisdom, this distinction between /
the Ksetra and Ksetrajna, reach the Supreme"" (13/34). Thus, by
distinguishing the two, a striver realizes, that self is unconnected
with Matter, and is totally untainted.

A striver, should possess both devotion and knowledge. In,
the Discipline of Devotion, there is predominance of devotion, -
while knowledge is secondary. In the Discipline of Knowledge,
there 1s predominance of knowledge while devotion occupies a
secondary place. In, the Discipline of Devotion, it is believed that
all the entities (beings) born of sattva, rajas and tamas, evolve
from Him (7/12) while, in the Discipline of Knowledge, it is
thought, that qualities (modes) of sattva (goodness), rajas (passion)
and tamas (ignorance), are born of prakrti (nature) (14/5). Both
types of strivers, accept that they are free from those qualities
(modes), and both of them realize, the same reality which cannot
be called, either dual or non-dual, neither, real nor unreal.

The strivers, following the Discipline of Devotion, having
exclusive devotion identify themselves with God and thus become
free from Matter, while devotees following the Discipline of
Knowledge, by discriminating between matter and the spirit,
"
903,"866 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
realize the self, and thus become free from matter.
Appendix—While explaining in details the notion of the
expression ‘mattah paratararh nanyat kificidasti’ (there is nothing
else besides Me) (7/7), whatever the Lord told in the preceding -
four verses and whatever He has not told—all that has been
concluded in this verse. The Lord declares, “All the Sattvika,
Rajasa and Tamasa modes evolve from Me and I provide them |
existence and agility; yet neither I am in them nor are they
in Me viz., only I am all. Therefore the striver who wants to
attain Me, instead of getting entangled in these modes, should
be inclined to Me. If he gets entangled in these modes, he can >
never attain salvation or devotion.” | -
The modes that are seen, heard and understood and that are
not seen, heard and understood—all of them should be included -
within the term ‘ye’ (whatever). |
The Sattvika, Rajasa and Tamasa modes have been called
‘bhava’ because they evolve from God. It means that God is in
the form of ‘bhava’ (ever-existent)*, therefore only the existent -
‘bhava’ will evolve from Him, how will ‘abhava’ (Non-existent)
evolve? As all these ‘bhavas’ (modes) evolve from Him, so
all of them are the manifestations of God—‘bhavanti bhava
bhutanarh matta eva prthagvidhah’ (Gita 10/5). It means that
with the body-senses-mind-intellect whatever Sattvika, Rajasa
and Tamasa feelings, actions, objects etc., are perceived, they
are all only Godt, Even the ‘sphurana’ (mere fleeting thought)
that comes to the mind whether good or bad, is only God. In the
world whatever good or bad, pure or impure, friend or enemy,
‘madbhavam so’dhigacchati’ (Gita 14/19)’, ‘sarvabhitesu yenaikam
bhavamavyayamiksate’ (Gita 18/20). |
{manasa vacasa drstya grhyate’ nyairapindriyaih | |
ahameva na matto’nyaditi budhyadhvamafijasa
(Srimadbha. 11/13/24)
"
904,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 867
wicked or noble, virtuous or sinful etc., is seen, heard, thought |
of and understood etc.,—all is only God. Besides God there is
nothing else anywhere. | :
If there is any selfish motive and we have a desire to take }
anything from others, then Sattvika, Rajasa and Tamasa—these :
three different kinds appear. But if there is no selfish motive and
we have an eye on the welfare of others, then these are nothing
but the manifestation of God. If we regard them for us and derive
pleasure from.them, they pave the way to ruin (Gita 3/37). |
‘The three modes are evolved from Me’—by saying this the
Lord means that a striver instead of having an eye on these modes, -
should have his eye on Him Who transcends these modes viz., he | :
having assumed the existence and greatness of the Lord, should .
establish relation with Him so that he may attain Him, and being
free from the sufferings forever, may attain the Supreme bliss. -
‘I am not in them and they are not in Me’—by saying this, the
Lord means, “If anyone instead of attaching importance.to Me |
as reality and my greatness, attaches importance and value to
Sattvika, Rajasa and Tamasa modes, objects and actions and is
attached to them, he instead of attaining Me, will follow the cycle -
of birth and death—‘karanam gunasango’sya sadasadyonijanmasu’
(Gita 13/21).
The Lord uses the expression ‘matta eva’ as if He wants
to say, “The three modes are evolved from Me, then instead of
having an inclination to Me, why do you get entangled in the
modes? Those who get entangled in these modes, can’t worship
Me (Gita 7/13). But those devotees, who don’t get entangled in
these modes, worship Me (Gita 7/16, 10/8). These modes are
not lasting because the cause stays, the effect does not stay. As
gold stays, ornaments don’t stay; earth stays (persists), the jar
does not remain; God remains, modes don’t stay (remain). The
modes are kaleidoscopic and perishable but God ever remains
the same, He is neither kaleidoscopic nor perishable. Therefore
"
905,"868 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 7
God is not attained by modes, but He is attained by renouncing
attachment to the modes. Therefore by overpowering Tamoguna
by Rajoguna and Rajoguna by Sattvaguna, the striver has to
transcend all the three gunas (modes).
| Here a point needs special attention that God endowed with
attributes and form is in fact only attributeless because He is free
from the modes of Sattva, Raja and Tama but He possesses virtues
such as glory, sweetness, beauty and generosity etc. Therefore |
the devotion to God Who is endowed with attributes and form,
is also called ‘Nirguna’ (free from the modes of goodness etc.,)
as “mannistharh nirgunarn smrtam’, ‘manniketarh tu nirgunam’, /
‘nirguno madapaérayah’, ‘matsevayarn tu nirguna’ (Srimadbha.
11/25/24—27).
Question—When all is God, why are Sattvika-Rajasa-Tamasa -
‘bhavas’ (modes) to be renounced?
Answer—As in the earth there is water everywhere but that
is available in the well, similarly God exists everywhere but :
the place where He attained is ‘Yajfia’ (performance of duty
selflessly)—‘tasmatsarvagatarh brahma nityarm yajiie pratisthitam’
(Gita 3/15). But Sattvika-Rajasa-Tamasa bhavas (entities) are not
places where God is available viz., by them God is not attained
(Gita 7/13). Therefore they are not useful for a striver. So the
Lord has declared—‘Neither I am in those modes nor are they
in Me.’ |
As in the field of millet, only millet is substantial, stalks and
leaves are not substantial. The aim of the farmer is only to get
millet. In order to get millet, he waters the field and manures it
for nourishing the soil (field) so that he may get the millet of
a good quality. Similarly a striver should aim at attaining God,
not the world. In order to attain God, a striver should serve
the world without any selfish motive. There is value of millet
rather than of stalks and leaves, because at the beginning there
is millet and in the end also millet remains. After taking out
"
906,"Verse 13] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 869
millet whatever stalks and leaves are left, they are not useful for
men, but they are feeds for animals. Similarly Sattvika, Rajasa
and Tamasa modes are for the deluded (unwise). These three
modes bind a man (Gita 14/5). Therefore these modes in spite
of being the manifestations of God are not for the self but their ;
use with discrimination is for worldly dealings. As poison is also
the manifestation of God but that is not to be taken. :
As leaves and stalks also emanate from the seed of millet
but there is no millet in them and in the millet there are no
stalks and leaves, similarly though the Sattvika-Rajasa-Tamasa
modes evolve from God, yet God is not in them and they are -
not in God.

born of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas, are born of Him, still neither
He is in them, nor are they in Him. It means, that God is free

eternal portion of God, is also free. But how is it bound? The

mohitam nabhijanati mamebhyah paramavyayam
Beguiled by these threefold dispositions (gunas) of Nature
(prakrti) this world (embodied soul) does not know Me, who is
beyond these and imperishable as well. 13
Comment:—
""Tribhirgunamayairbhavairebhih...paramavyayam'— The three
disposition (modes) of Nature—sattva, rajas and tamas, evolve
and dissolve. A man, by identifying himself with these modes,
thinks himself as sattvika, rajasika or tamasika. Being deluded
"
907,"870 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
by. them, he cannot deem that he is an eternal fragment of God.
Losing sight of this eternal affinity with God, he accepts his
affinity with transitory mental tendencies—this is his delusion.
The term ‘Jagat’ (world), here denotes ‘embodied soul.' The
spirit (soul), because of its identity with the kaleidoscopic body —
is called ‘Jagat’ (world). It accepts, the body's birth, death, health
and sickness etc., as its own. So long as, it continues to accept
its identity with the. body, it will remain the world ie., it will
go on following the cycle of birth and death, without living
permanently anywhere. | 7
Men are deluded, because they accept as separate entities _
the three modes of nature, besides God. If they accept these as
Divine manifestation, they cannot be deluded.
Delusion arises, out of either of the assumptions, regard
the body as yours, or accept yourself as the body. Acceptance
of the body as yours, is 'mineness' while acceptance that the
self, is body is egoism. This Egoism and 'mineness'’, is called,
delusion. It is because of delusion, that a man cannot know, the
reality about God. It is a rule, that a man can know the world by
isolating himself from it, and he can know God by identifying __
himself with Him, because, he is totally different from the body,
and one with God. |
Our affinity with God, is natural because we are His eternal
fragment, but our affinity with body and the world, is man-made
and artificial. If we accept this artificial affinity as real, that is
_ our delusion, and it obstructs in realizing real affinity.
Now, there is a question, whether first man turned away from
God, or got deluded by the three modes of nature. Philosophers
are of the opinion, that both of them have been there from times
immemorial, they are without beginning. Therefore it cannot be
said which of these is former and which is latter. Man should
make the right use of freedom given to him, by God. By doing
so, he can transcend the three modes of Nature, and be free from:
"
908,"Verse 13] ~SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 871
the cycle of birth and death. This proves, that by misusing his
freedom, and being entangled in sensual and ephemeral pleasures,
he cannot realize God.
By the term 'Paramavyayam’, Lord Krsna says, that He is ;
above the threefold modes of nature i.e., He is unconnected with
and free from them, there is no modification in Him. Moreover,
He is imperishable. But the man, deluded by modes of nature
cannot know His real self. |
Appendix—The man, who instead of seeing God, perceives
(sees) Sattvika, Rajasa and Tamasa dispositions (modes), enjoys
them and derives pleasure from them, he is deluded by those -
dispositions viz., is bound by God’s Divine illusion, and the
result is that he follows the cycle of birth and death. It means -
that Sattvika, Rajasa and Tamasa dispositions (actions, objects, =
time, nature and modes etc.,) are transient while God is eternal.
Those who enjoy the transient, get bound; but those who having
renounced the transient, take refuge in God, get liberated (Gita 7/14).
In this verse the term “Jagata’ has been used for the embodied
soul. It means that the being by according reality, by valuing -
and by being attached to the entity which really does not exist,
becomes ‘Jagata’. The sentient (by flouting Viveka) becomes
insentient. The higher nature (prakrti) becomes lower nature. The
soul assumes the origin and destruction of the world as its origin
and destruction, and the profit and loss of the world as its own
profit and loss. As a man, by becoming, obsessed with desire,
becomes ‘kamatmanah’ viz., gets practically identified with desire
(Gita 2/43); and by intimate kinship with God ‘manmayah’ viz.,
gets absorbed in God (Gita 4/10); similarly the embodied soul (self)
being deeply attached to the world becomes the world (Jagata).
The only difference is that a striver’s (the self) identity with God
is eternal but identity with desire or ‘Jagata’ (world) is transient.
A man (the self) has assumed the existence of other entity
besides God, by assuming its existence he regarded it as valuable,
"
909,"872 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 7
by valuing it he got attached to it and by being attached to it,
he lost his independent existence and became ‘Jagata’. He who
regards the existence of the. world only, forgets one’s own reality
and becomes ‘Jagata’ which is unreal; and who assumes the _
existence of God, being oblivious of the independent existence
of his own, becomes God—‘mama. sadharmyamagatah’ (Gita
14/2):Who is real. si . ee

The Lord calls the embodied soul ‘Jagat’ because of not
cognising the fact that “I am sentient”, man started assuming
the insentient body as ‘I’ (his own self) and as ‘mine’. The self
though attributeless and imperishable yet because of being ‘Jagata’ = -
gets bound by Sattvika-Rajasa-Tamasa modes—‘nibadhnanti |
mahabaho dehe dehinamavyayam’ (Gita 14/5). In fact the self ~
being a fragment of the divine God is divine only (Gita 13/31) _
but being attached to the mundane ‘Jagata’ he becomes mundane
(worldly). From ego (the elements) downward to the earth—all
is “Apara Prakrti’—lower nature (Gita 7/4). Therefore as the
earth is insentient (matter), so is ego also matter. When the self
being identified with ego becomes ‘ahankaravimudhatma’ viz., -
assumes ego as the self, then having a gradual downfall it (he)
becomes the insentient world viz., its divinity (sentience) is lost
(forgotten) and it does not realize its divinity. |

Those who don’t get attached to the modes, the matter vanishes
for them but they see only God everywhere—‘Vasudevah sarvam’
(all is God) (Gita 7/19). But those who are attached to modes,
can’t see God but see the world only, therefore they perceive
God also as worldly. They perceive even the transcendental Lord,
bound by modes and see immortal (imperishable) God as mortal
(perishable) (Gita 7/24). A devotee sees nothing else besides
God but the worldly people, attached to the modes, see only the
world, nothing else. Therefore a devotee attains only bliss while a
worldly person suffers only sorrow—‘duhkhalayam’ (Gita 8/15).

'‘Daivi hyesi gunamayi* mama maya duratyaya'—The
Divine illusion of the Lord, consisting of the three modes of -
nature-—Sattva, Raja and Tama is extremely difficult to surmount. _
People because of the desire of pleasures and prosperity, cannot
be free from this illusion. Because of their attachment for the
world, including the body and its pleasure and pain etc., they
get entangled in them. This Divine illusion, is hard to surmount,
when they accept the independent existence of the modes of -
Nature. If they do not accept their separate entity, besides God,
they will overcome this Divine illusion. |
""Mameva ye prapadyante mayametam taranti te'—Those, who
take refuge in Me, alone cross this illusion, because instead of
beholding the three modes of Nature they behold Me only. As has
already been described, these three modes :of nature are neither
* Lord Krsna in the twelfth verse has declared that the three modes of
goodness, of passion and of ignorance proceed from Him. The same fact has been
pointed out here when the Lord declares that His illusion consisting of the three
modes is divine. The term ‘Esa’ stands for the threefold modes of nature by which
the world is deluded as has been described in the thirteenth verse.
The Divine illusion has been called to be consisting of the three modes
because this illusion in the form of the modes of Nature is the evolute of Nature.
These are the modes rather than Nature (Prakrti) which bind the man (soul).
"
911,"874 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
in Me nor am I, in them. I perform all actions without having
the least attachment. Thus, those who know this reality, do. not
get entangled, in the three modes and pierce this illusion. They
do not depend on mind and intellect etc.,.because they know
_ that mind and intellect etc., also belong to nature (matter), which —
perish every moment. So they have a disinclination towards matter,
and an inclination towards Me, because they know that soul is
an eternal fragment, of Mine. | ,
_ Lord Krsna, by using the terms 'Mameva', means to say that
they take refuge only in Him, because they do not accept any
other existence, besides Him. Thus, those who without depending
on money, material and men etc., take refuge in Him onlyie.,
depend on Him only, cross this illusion. -

The senses, body, mind, intellect and worldly possessions,
belong to the Lord and therefore, these are to be used in the
service of the Lord, without any selfish motive. If we do not
do so, we are dishonest and we do not perform our duty. But,
if we use it in His service, He gets pleased and by His grace,
we penetrate the veil of illusion. |

Actually, all things have been given to us by God, but
we feel proud of them, by thinking these as our own. This is
an error. God is.so gracious and generous that He gives the
things, in such an unique way, that He does not show that they
have been given by Him. So we accept these as our own. Only
devotees, can realize His grace and generosity. But, those who
have disinclination for Him, cannot realize that all the things
have been bestowed upon them, by God, by His grace and they
cannot possess them forever. So they cannot have an exclusive
devotion, for God.

This verse means, that those who take refuge in Him Le.,
those who possess divine traits, cross His Divine illusion, and
those who take refuge in gods i.e., those who possess, demoniacal
traits—attaching importance to body and pleasures etc., cannot
"
912,"Verse 14] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 875
cross His Divine illusion. Such persons, possessing demoniacal
traits have to return to life even though they might have gained,
the world of Brahma, but they have to follow, the cycle of birth
and death. : =
_ Appendix—When a man turning away his face from the
world, takes refuge in God, then he crosses (overcomes) the
‘Maya’ (the evolute of the lower nature) viz., his ego is totally
destroyed. ‘Refuge in God’ means to identify the self with 7
God viz., to accept the entity of God only. He should assume
neither the independent entity of the self nor of the ‘Maya’. He
should depend neither on ego nor on ‘Maya’ (modes). It needs
no exertion, no effort. -
The man himself has assumed the existence of ‘Maya’— _
‘yayedam dharyate jagat’ (Gita 7/3), ‘manah sasthanindnyani
prakrtisthani karsati’? (Gita 15/7). If he, not recognising the -
existence of ‘Maya’, had taken refuge in God, he would have
crossed the ‘Maya’ viz., for him the ‘Maya’ would have had
no existence.
A man, by depending on the insentient (matter) viz., by ;
assuming it as his and for him, himself becomes insentient
(matter) and is called ‘Jagata’ (Gita 7/13). But by depending
on God, he attains divinity and becomes a devotee. By becoming
a devotee, the world is lost to him viz., for him the world does
not remain the world but it becomes the manifestation of God
which it really is. |
By the term ‘mameva’ the Lord means to say, “The soul is
a fragment of only Mine (My own) (mama eva)—‘mamaivamso
jivaloke’ (Gita 15/7). Therefore if a striver takes refuge only in
Me (mam eva), he crosses the ‘Maya’. So the devotees, who
take refuge in Me, have no relationship with anyone else besides
Me, their relation with anyone else is impossible because they
hold that there is no other entity at all, besides Me. They don’t
see anyone else and anyone else is not seen to them. From
"
913,"876 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
their view-point there is neither existence nor value of the lower
nature and they don’t regard it as theirs. They regard it as My
manifestation as really it is.”

The devotees who follow the guidance of “Viveka’, having
renounced dependence on ego viz., by renouncing the world, |
depend on God. But those who cannot follow the dictates of
their Viveka, but have the predominance of faith and belief,
such simple hearted and straightforward devotees with theirego
(as they are, so) take refuge in God. The Lord Himself destroys
the ego of such devotees (Gita 10/11).

mayayapahrtajiianad asuram § bhavamasritah

The evil-doers, the deluded, the lowest of men, deprived of
discrimination (wisdom) by illusion (maya) having succumbed to
demoniacal nature, do not take refuge in Me. 15
Comment:— |

‘Na mam duskrtino midh&h prapadyante naradhamah'—
Those, who are evil-doers and deluded, do not take refuge
in Him. Evil-doers are those, who have attachment, for the
acquired worldly kaleidoscopic things, and who have desire to
get unacquired ones. Fulfilment of desires, leads to greed and
obstacles to fulfilment of desires, lead to anger. Thus, those
who because of their desire, enjoy sensual pleasures against the
ordinance of scriptures, because of greed, commit sins, such as
"
914,"Verse 15} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 877

falsehood, fraud, betrayal and dishonesty etc., and because of

anger, have feelings of envy, jealousy and enmity and commit

violence, are all evil-doers.
Desire, evolves when a man attaches importance to any ;

worldly entity. This desire, leads a man to delusion and he thinks —

that he should, enjoy worldly pleasures and should live. Thus

he instead of seeking refuge in God, seeks refuge in perishable

things and objects etc., owing to pre-ponderance of the mode .

of their ignorance. | :
Men are deluded, because they cannot discriminate, between

the real and the unreal, the imperishable and the perishable, the -

improper and the proper etc., and they are disinclined, towards

God. Such _ evil-doers and deluded ones, cannot have a resolve, -

for spirituality, then how can they take refuge in Him? _
Those evil-doers and deluded ones, are the lowest of men.

They are lower than, even animals, because animals follow rules

of nature, while they do not. Moreover, animals, while suffering

the fruit of their previous actions, move higher towards human

life, whereas, human beings by having this body (bestowed upon _ -

them for God-realization) by doing sins and injustice, follow the

path, which leads them to hell and animal-life. Lord Krsna, has

declared about such people (Gita 16/19-20)—""I repeatedly, throw

those evil, cruel, haters, and vilest among men, into demoniacal

wombs. Thus cast, they sink into, still lower depths.""

the wonderful illusion of the Lord, consisting of the three modes

of nature (7/14) possessing demoniacal traits viz:, busy with

bringing up senses, body and mind etc., such people have total

disinclination for Him, and thus cannot seek refuge in Him.

Secondly, such people, are so much deprived of discrimination,

that they cannot perceive the perishable nature of the worldly

things, and so they hanker after prosperity, pleasure, praise etc.

They consider it to be their chivalry and success, and think that
"
915,"878 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA (Chapter7
there 1s no aim of life, besides them. So they cannot perceive
reality about the world that it is perishable and they have no
lasting connection with it. |

The term ‘asu', stands for, vital force (prana). In spite of,
perceiving them as active and perishable, they are ever-engaged __
in nourishing them. They attach importance only, to mundane
objects, which are necessary for the maintenance of their life.
They attach more importance to money, than to necessities of life. :
Money is not usable by itself. It is useful through commodities.
They attach importance, not only to money, but to its quantum.
The quantum enhances pride, which is a demoniac trait, and
leads to all afflictions and sins.* | :

Here Lord Krsna has declared, that evil-doers do not seek __
refuge in Him, while in the thirtieth verse of the ninth chapter,
He declares that even if the vilest simmer worships Him with
exclusive devotion, he should be considered a saint, and he secures
lasting peace. How? The answer is, that the vilest sinner has no
natural inclination to God, but if his unfavourable circumstances -
or grace of saints or any virtuous action of the past, inspires
him to take refuge in Him, he becomes a saint because God
is equanimous to all, without having any hatred or liking
(Gita 9/29). He, equally showers His blessings, upon all
creatures, whether they are vile of virtuous.

In fact, a vile person is more deserving, as far as God's
grace is concerned, because he thinks that he has no virtue. As
a mother, loves all her sons equally, the Lord's heart is naturally
gracious to all beings. The Lord, the mother of all ages, loves
all creatures equally. Therefore, if a man seeks refuge in Him,
the Lords’ heart, melts with a great compassion and He instead

* Pride is the root of the world which is in the form of birth and death and
it causes innumerable kinds of afflictions and miseries (Manasa 7/74/30).

916,"Verse 15] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI ° 879
of thinking of his past errors, thinks of what he has in his heart
now (Manasa 1/29/3). :
It has been declared by Him, in the Ramacaritamanasa that
even a man having envy with all beings but finding himself ;
helpless, in the world, however takes refuge in God, He by His
grace, without paying any heed to his pride, delusion, fraud and
deception etc., keeping his good sentiment in view makes him
a saint very quickly (5/48/1-2). : |
_ A righteous man, depends on his righteousness and so does
not depend on God exclusively, while a vile person, without
having any support, depends on the Lord exclusively. Therefore -
the Lord's heart melts, and thus the vile person, becomes a saint.
Moreover, the nature of evil-doers does not allow them to take
refuge, in God. But, if anyone somehow or the other, takes _
refuge in Him, He is ever-prepared to embrace him. Therefore,
in the two contexts, there 1s no contradiction, but God's grace,
is revealed in both of these.
The virtuous and vile, are not those who perform virtuous
and vile actions. But, virtuous are those, who have inclination -
for God, while vile are those, who have disinclination for Him.
Though performance of actions, such as oblation, charity, penance,
pilgrimage, fast is good, but when these are performed for their
fruit, they are not so valuable, as is the inclination for God, because
God's grace enables a man to become pious very quickly. Being
pious is far superior to piety gained, through virtuous actions.
Therefore, when a man being helpless and disappointed from all
quarters, invokes Almighty, His heart melts and enables him, to
become a loving devotee to Him. |
Feelings of the heart, are more important, than actions
performed, with the body, while exclusive devotion of one's
own self, is far superior to such feelings. No evil can stand,
where there is exclusive devotion. It is this, which enables a
man to become pious very quickly, because the soul being an
"
917,"880 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
eternal portion of the Lord, is pious. It is because of sins and
ill-feelings, that he has become impious. = = |
Appendix—Those people who don’t take refuge in God, depend
on the fiendish, demoniacal and delusive nature (Git4 9/12). They
have an eye on the world only (objects and actions). They don’t
believe in the existence of God, then there is no question of their
- taking refuge in God. Their final aim is to hoard riches and to enjoy
pleasures—‘kamopabhogaparama etavaditiniscitah’ (Gita 16/11).
Their wisdom being carried away by ‘Maya’, they come under the
sway of ‘Maya. Being under the sway of ‘Maya’, they can’t cross it.
*‘Mayayapahrtajnanah’—This expression means that ‘Maya’ -
has overwhelmed their “Viveka’. They remain engrossed in ‘Maya’
viz., they indulge in enjoying pleasures, in accumulation of wealth,
in decoration of the body and the house etc. They make new ©
inventions which provide pleasure and comfort to the body and
they attach special importance to them. How can such people,
who know only the transitory and ephemeral objects, know the |
unchangeable reality? They don’t even cast a glance and can’t
cast a glance at the Supreme truth. - | ;

"

Comment:— - _
'Caturvidha bhajante mam janah sukrtino'rjuna'—There are,
four types of virtuous men (devotees), who worship God viz.,
seek refuge in Him. In the preceding verse, the Lord talked
of the evil-doers, while here He talks of the virtuous. These
virtuous men, don't perform actions, for their fruit, but for God,
by having affinity for Him. They are of two types. First, are
those who perform oblation, charity and penance etc., and other
actions, according to their caste and creed etc., in accordance
with the ordinance of scriptures for God. The second ones are -
those, who have constant remembrance of God, loud chanting
of His name and are engaged in narrating or listening to stories :
of the drama of Lord's human life.
Those, who are inclined towards God, are fortunate and
virtuous, and deserve to be called, human beings. Their inclination
might have evolved, either from virtuous actions of the past, their
frustration in life, their thoughtfulness, good company or study —
of the sacred books etc. Inclination towards Him, is prosperity: |
and disinclination for Him, is adversity (Manasa 5/32/2).
God has bestowed upon man,. this human body so that. he
may realize God. Man is independent, in realizing Him. Therefore,
if a man, by making proper use of this body, by giving up
actions, which are not sanctioned by scriptures, is engaged in
God-realization, he can attain Him, easily. But if he does not
make proper use of his freedom, and does the contrary, he paves
the way to hell. and eighty-four lac forms of life. Thus, only
persons who are engaged in adoration of the Lord, are virtuous
and they deserve to be called men.
Arto jijiiaisurartharthi jiiani ca bharatarsabha'—The distressed
(sufferer), the seeker of knowledge, the seeker of wealth and a
man of wisdom—all the four types of virtuous men, worship
God viz., seek refuge in Him. , :
(1) A seeker of wealth—Devotees, who seek, wealth only
"
919,"882 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
from God, are seekers of wealth. They worship God to gain
wealth. Their conviction is, that none else besides God, can fulfil
their desire for wealth. Holding this view, they recite and chant
_ God's name and adore Him, scrupulously for getting riches.
One who resorts to worldly means, for fulfilling his desire
- for wealth, but sometimes invokes God for it, is not a devotee
-to God, he is a devotee to riches.
But, devotees of God seek wealth only from Him. Such
devotees gradually develop inclination, for God, and their desire
for wealth, slow by diminishes and finally it disappears. Dhruva
was such a devotee. : : | -
One day, Dhruva wanted to sit in the lap of his father, but
his step-mother did not allow him to do so. She said, ""You have -
not worshipped God. You are unlucky, because you are the son
of your unlucky mother. So you do not deserve, to sit in the 7
lap, of your father."" Dhruva narrated the incident to his mother.
His mother said, ""My darling, she is nght. Both of us have not
worshipped God."" Dhruva said, ""Mother, now I am going to
adore God."" Saying these words Dhruva made for the forest, for ;
adoration. On the way, he met sage Narada, who said to him,
""O innocent boy, where are you going, all alone? In the jungle,
there are wild animals which will devour you. Come with me
to the king. He, on my request will make arrangement for your
mother, as well as for you."" Having listened to Narada, his faith
in God was intensified and he said, ""Sire, I want to be engaged
in adoration (tapa)."" Having learnt of his determination, sage
Narada imparted to him the sacred Mantra of twelve letters,
(Om namo bhagavate vasudevaya), and advised him, to meditate
-. upon the four-armed Lord Visnu and then directed him to go to
Madhuvana, for adoration. | |
Dhruva worshipped the Lord, with such a firm belief, that
the Lord revealed Himself to Dhruva, within six months. The
Lord granted him the boon that he would become an heir to
"
920,"Verse 16] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 883
the throne, but Dhruva was not pleased with this boon. His
mind was purified by adoration, and so he felt ashamed that he
committed a mistake in having a desire to gain a kingdom. It
means that Dhruva wanted to gain kingdom but not by any other
means, besides devotion and adoration. By means of adoration,
he gained a kingdom and his desire, perished. Thus, a seeker of
wealth devotee seeks wealth only from God.
Now-a-days people, who want to earn money by foul means,
sometimes pray to God to grant them money. Such people are
seekers of wealth, but they are not devotees of God, because
instead of believing Him, they believe in falsehood, fraud and :
other foul means, while devotees, depend on God only, and by
having affinity for Him adore Him only. Such devotees, because
of any factor, such as past-influence etc., sometimes, desire for ~
favourable circumstances. They are devotees, no doubt, but due
to this desire, they are called, seekers of wealth,  —_
(2) Distressed (sufferer) devotees—Such type of devotees,
pray to God in adversity. They pray only to God, to do away ;
with their miseries and misfortunes. Such a distressed devotee,
was Uttara*, because she did not seek refuge in anyone else,
except the Lord, to get md of her troubles.T
Those, who having affinity with God, depend on Him only
and do not desire, for favourable circumstances, but sometimes,
* The examples of Draupadi and Gajendra (the elephant) are not befitting
because they adopted other means to be free from suffering. Draupadi sought help
from others and also used her power to do away with her suffering. Similarly, the
elephant also sought the help of other male and female elephants and also used his
power. Thus both of them went on suffering. But as soon as both of them sought
refuge only in God, they were relieved of their sufferings. ——
f O Lord of the gods, Master of the world, the great Yogi, protect me from
the burning iron-arrow which is moving quickly towards me. O Omnipotent, there
is none besides You in the world who can protect me because all the people are
killing each other. O Lord, it will not make much difference if this red-hot arrow
burns me but it should not destroy the fruit of my womb.
"
921,"884 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 7
the desire itself evolves in them, to be free from suffering. Such
devotees are also distressed ones.

(3) Devotees, as seekers of knowledge—The devotees, who
want to know the self, and reality, depend only on God, having
exclusive devotion for Him. Uddhava, can be named among such

‘devotees. Lord Krsna, imparted to him divine knowledge which
is known as 'Uddhava Gita’ (Srimadbhagavata 11/7-—30).

Those, who having affinity for God, are engrossed in —~
His adoration but sometimes, because of company or past
influences want to know the self or divinity, are also called,
seekers of knowledge. : - ;

(4) Men of wisdom—tThe term 'Ca', has been used, to show
the superiority of the men of wisdom, to other three types of = -
virtuous men. Devotees, who neither have a desire for favourable
circumstances, nor are worried about the unfavourable ones, nor |
have a desire to know the self, but by depending on God, are
engrossed in divine devotion, are called men of wisdom. They

_ perceive, the desirable and undesirable circumstances, as sport of
God. They ever remain engrossed, in His devotion without having
a desire, in the least. The Gopis, whose desire was nothing besides
Lord Krsna's happiness, can be named, among such devotees.

Here, a fact needs attention that the seekers of wealth,
the distressed, and the seekers of knowledge, who adore the

: Lord, devotion for God is aroused in them, and they are called,
devotees. But those who seek knowledge, wealth and freedom
from suffering, by anyother means, have no affinity for God,
and so devotion is not aroused in them, so they cannot be
called devotees. | |

Saint's utterances, affirm that it is God alone, who loves
His devotees, whereas devotees merely surrender, themselves to
God. It is so, because he alone is qualified to be a true lover,
who does not expect anything from others. A devotee, has only
affinity for God. God actually surrenders Himself, to all His
"
922,"Verse 16] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 885
creatures. When a devotee surrenders himself to God without
having a desire, in the least, he is called a man of wisdom
viz., a devout devotee. In that case, he has no separate entity,
he becomes one with God, viz., there ts only God's entity. .
(1) Four boys were playing. Just then, their father, came
with four mangoes. At the sight of the mangoes, one of
the sons, asked for a mango, the second cried for a mango.
Both of them, were given a mango each. The third one, only
looked at the mangoes and the fourth one went on playing, -
without even having a look at the mangoes. The father, gave
one mango to each of the other, two boys also. Here the -
boy who asked for the mango is a seeker of wealth, the one .
who wept is distressed, the one, who looked at the mango,
is a seeker of knowledge, and the fourth one, is a man of
wisdom. The seeker of wealth seeks favourable (desirable)
circumstances, the sufferer seeks to do away with suffering,
the seeker of knowledge, wants to know God, while the wise :
(devout devotee), seeks nothing.
All the above-mentioned men, are virtuous, because they
Jepend on God predominantly. So they are different from men,
vho have fallen from Yoga (Gita 6/41-42). Similarly the seekers
% wealth and distressed devotees, are different from, those
elfish persons who perform actions for their fruit, because
heir wisdom has been lost by various desires (Gita 7/20), so
ney are included among men, of demoniacal traits. Among
1e devotees, such as_ seekers of wealth etc., the degree of
aperiority or inferiority in their devotion, is due to desire.
1 spite of desire, they are not ‘Hrtajnanah’ viz., their wisdom
as not been carned away. Rather, the Lord has called them
yble (7/18), and virtuous, and thus has praised them.
Those, who seek refuge in the Lord may have hidden
"
923,"886 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 7
desires but there is predominance of devotion for God, in
them. So the more intimacy they develop for the Lord, their
desires diminish and then they become unique. So the Lord
has called them noble and declared the man of wisdom verily
His own self (7/18)..

(2) Acceptance of affinity with God, is the best means to
attain Him. This affinity, wipes out all evil and defects. Moreover,
the Lord does not look at defects, but He perceives affinity. All
the creatures are His, but it is an error on their part, that by
forgetting real affinity, they have accepted their affinity, with
the world. As soon as, this error is rectified, they attain to Him.
In having this affinity, a devotee need not resort to mind and ~
intellect etc., while, in other means, he has to take their help. _

| Even the vilest creatures, are His. So He, as mentioned, in
the sixteenth chapter of the Gita, throws them into demoniacal ~
wombs, so_ that they may be purified. The Lord, like a mother
who does not consult a child while bathing him, does not consult
the creatures, because He wants to purify them.

A devotee, has real affinity for God, but sometimes, he has a
desire. In that case, there is predominance of affinity, while desire
occupies.a secondary place. Such devotees hold a higher position.

The second type of devotees, are those who want their desires
to be satisfied, by other worldly people. But when they are not
satisfied, they pray to God. Because, of the lack of exclusive
devotion, they hold the second position. |

The third type, is those who have affinity with God, so that

_._their desires may be fulfilled. In this case, there is predominance
of desire, while affinity with God occupies a subsidiary place.

Desire is of two types—spiritual and mundane.

(i) Spiritual desire—It is of two kinds, for salvation and
for exclusive devotion. oo .
"
924,"Verse 16] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 887
In the desire for salvation, there is desire to know the self
or reality. So, it is not desire, it is need or want. A need is,
that which is positively satiated, and with its satiation no other
need is born.* Need, means lack of something necessary, and
this need is for God-realization.
The second kind of desire, is for exclusive devotion, in
which a devotee surrenders himself to God, because he himself :
is His fragmentt.
Thus desires mentioned above, are not really desires.
(ii) Mundane desire—It 1s also of two kinds—the desire to get 7
pleasure and the desire to get rid of pains. Desire for comfort,
luxuries, name, fame and pleasures etc., here and hereafter, are -
such that they lead a man, to bondage and degradation. These -
are demoniacal traits, which should be renounced.
The second type of desire, is to do away with pain. Pain can
xe caused by fate, such as flood, drought etc., which is known as
adhidaivika’, or by creatures, such as lions, snakes and thieves
‘tc., which is known as ‘adhibhautika, or it can be pertaining -
o mind and body etc., such as worry, fear, lunacy and diseases
tc., which is called adhyatmika.'+
* A desire 1s never satisfied. One desire gives birth to other desires. As a
‘an has desire for a certain amount of money. When he gains it, he desires more
id thus his desire for money is never satisfied. Similar is the case with other
‘rishable worldly things such as pleasures, praise, health and family etc. Thus
‘sires should be renounced because they are never satisfied. Moreover these
sires for the perishable have an access to the body and the name, not to the
lf. So they are not yours.
+The desire for exclusive devotion for God is superior to the desire for
vation; because in salvation he has a desire to get something, he wants to
ain salvation but in exclusive devotion he wants to surrender himself to God,
gives himself to God. In salvation there remains ego in its subtle form while
Jevotion there is no ego.
¢The 'Adhyatmika’ pain is of two kinds— 'Adhi' and ""Vyadhi’. Worry is |
wn as 'Adhi' and physical disease is known as 'Vyadhi'. Adhi is of two kinds—
.unacy (11) Worry, sadness, fear and agitation etc. Lunacy is the result of the
"
925,"888 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
Actually the mundane desires, are never satisfied, because if
one is satisfied, another spring up, and the process continues.

: Appendix—In the fourteenth verse the Lord declared, “The
devotees, who take refuge in Me, cross the ‘Maya’ consisting —
of the three modes.” Who are those devotees who take refuge

\ in God?—this fact is related in this verse. |

In the preceding verse the Lord described the evil-doers;
now in this verse He describes the virtuous persons. The most
deadly evil or sin is to assume the world, which is different

from us (the self), to be our own, while the most virtuous act
is to regard the Lord who is inseparable from us as our own. -
- Therefore those who regard the world as theirs are evil-doers
while those who regard the Lord as theirs, are virtuous. -
A sensual man does not worship God, therefore a seeker of -
wealth can be the devotee of God but the seeker of pleasures
cannot be the devotee of God. The reason is that the seeker
of pleasure is more engrossed in the world, while a seeker of
wealth is less engrossed in the world and he is more inclined
towards God. Because .of the assumption of any other entity -
to some extent besides God, a devotee is either the seeker of
wealth or the afflicted or the seeker of knowledge. If there is
no such assumption at all of any other entity besides God, then
he becomes the wise (devotee). It means that because of the
assumption of any other entity besides God, there are four kinds
of virtuous men. In fact besides the existence of God no other
- entity is possible. : :
He who wants to know ‘Jnana’ (knowledge) with “Vijnana’
in other words he wants to know God fully (in full) is a ‘Jijnasu’

_ (seeker of knowledge). A ‘Jijfiasu’ wants to know the glory,
influence and power of God, therefore he has special relish in
actions of the past while worry and sadness are the results of ignorance. When a
man possesses knowledge his worry and sadness are wiped out but he may suffer
from lunacy as the fruit of his past actions.
"
926,"Verse 16] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 889

the Lord’s sportive display and stories. The Lord instead of

using the word ‘mumuksu’ (seeker of salvation) has used the

term ‘Jijfidsu’ (seeker of knowledge) because a ‘mumuksu’ is

one who wants to realize the self, while a ‘Jijiasu’ may want |
to realize the self or may want devotion. In a ‘mumuksu’ there

is predominance of attaining salvation, while in a ‘Jijnasu’

devotee, there is predominance of surrendering himself to God.

A ‘mumuksu’ has knowledge of the Supreme (the Absolute)

and a ‘Jijmasu’ devotee has knowledge of ‘Vasudevah sarvam’

(all is God). A self-realized (enlightened) soul has knowledge

of the Supreme but a devotee has the knowledge of God in its
entirety (Gita 7/29-30).

In the seekers of wealth, in the afflicted and in the seekers :
of knowledge, gradually attachment to the world decreases and -
attachment (devotion) to God increases. So long as a striver
sustains the world, he remains the seeker of wealth or the sufferer |
or the seeker of knowledge. When he does not sustain the world,
hen he remains only a ‘Jnani’ (the wise) (a devotee).

The devotee who has knowledge of God in full viz., ‘all :
s God’, has been called ‘Jnani’. The same “Jnani’ devotee has
een called ‘Jnanavan’ (the man of wisdom) 1n the nineteenth

erse of this chapter.

An ‘artharthi’ without being satisfied with the circumstances—
vallable wants wealth. An ‘arta’ is satisfied with the circumstances,
> 1s placed 1a, but while he suffers pain, he can’t tolerate it. In
1 ‘artharthi’ craving for wealth is not predominant, eagerness
r God is predominant. He has the desire for wealth but he
ants this desire to be satisfied only by God. The reason is that
od lacks nothing. The lower nature is only of God. The ‘arta’
ints his sufferings to be removed only by God. The ‘Jijnasu’
mts knowledge to be imparted by only God. But when a
votee has such a keen yearning to love God alone, then he

longer remains a seeker of wealth, a sufferer and a seeker
"
927,"890 _ SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
of knowledge but he becomes a ‘Jani’ viz., a devotee having
exclusive devotion to God. ,

An ‘artharth’ has constant attachment to wealth because he
hankers after wealth every time. But an ‘arta’ has no continuous
relation with suffering because suffering does not persist all the —

. time. A ‘Jijiasu’ does not care for pleasure or pain, therefore
he has neither a desire to get pleasure nor a desire to get rid
-of sufferings. The seeker of wealth and the sufferer—both by -
‘becoming seekers of knowledge become ‘Jiiani’ viz., devotees.

The devotee who is seeker of wealth when is gifted with

‘wealth by God, repents of his mistake; as Dhruva repented of ;
his desire for kingdom when he got the kingdom. But a sufferer-
devotee does not feel so much sorry, but he has the notion that _
God frees sufferers from sufferings; as Draupadi and Gajendra
(king of elephants) after being protected, didn’t feel sorry, but —
they had an inclination towards God. A sufferer-devotee can’t
tolerate suffering—this is his weakness.

A jJijiiasu devotee does not know God in full. He is not
satisfied by attaining salvation or enlightenment but he. has hunger _
for love (devotion). But for a Jiiani-devotee besides God there
is no other entity in the least at all, then how can he feel the
lack of anything? Therefore the Lord has called a Jnani (the man

Of wisdom) (the devotee with exclusive devotion) His own self
- (manifestation)—‘jnani tvatmaiva me matam’ (Gita 7/18).

Comment:—
'Tesaim jiiani nityayukta'—Among the four kinds of virtuous
men, a man of wisdom is the best, because he 1s steadfast viz., os
he is constantly established in God. He thinks of nothing, besides
God. As the cowherdesses while milking cows, churning curd
and discharging other domestic duties, thought only of God* a
man of wisdom while performing all the mundane and spiritual
actions, is attached to God alone. -
'Ekabhaktirvisisyate'-—The man of wisdom, without having | .
any desire of his own, has an exclusive devotion for God. So
he is the best one. ~
Though all the four kinds, of virtuous men are engaged in
30d's devotion, yet the first three, have no exclusive devotion,
recause they have some desire or the other of their own. The
eeker of wealth, seeks favourable circumstances, a sufferer —
seks to do away with unfavourable circumstances, a seeker of :
nowledge, has a desire to know his self or Divinity. But, the
ian of wisdom (devout devotee) has exclusive devotion for God,
ithout having any desire of his own.
‘Priyo hi jnanino'tyarthamaham sa ca mama priyah'—I am
tremely dear to the wise, because he has exclusive devotion
c Me, without having any desire of his own. Therefore, he is
tremely dear to Me.
Though all creatures, being fragments of God, are naturally

dear to Him, and He brings up all of them, without any partiality,
yet, those who have an inclination for Him, become especially
dear, to Him. ,

When a devotee, becomes free from desires, axiomatic
devotion (love) is aroused, in Him. This love, neither ends nor
lessens, but increases every moment, and is limitless, endless
and knows no satiety.

- Appendix—The Lord has called His devotee who is
exclusively devoted to him ‘Jnani’ (wise) because “All is
God”—this is the real and final knowledge (wisdom), there
is nothing beyond it. Therefore the devoted (devout) devotee,
who has realized this knowledge, is a real Jnani. (Gita 7/19). —
The reason is that such a devotee holds that there is no other —
entity besides God, while a man who applies his Viveka, holds
that there are two entities—the real and the unreal. It means ~
that here the term ‘Jnani’ has not been used for the liberated
self-realized soul but it has been used for the ‘Jnani’ viz.,
the devoted (devout) devotee who has realized ‘All is God”.
In the Gita, the Lord principally has called a devotee ‘Jnani’
(7/16—18) because he is the highest and real ‘Jnani’. He loves ~
God alone, therefore he is the best—‘ekabhaktirvisisyate’ .
- The Lord’s devotee who is the seeker of wealth is ‘anitya-
~ yukta’ (not constantly established in God). The sufferers is less
- ‘anityayukta’ than the seeker of wealth. The seeker of knowledge
is less ‘anityayukta’ than the sufferer. But a ‘Jani’ is totally
‘nityayukta’ (constantly established in God).

‘Priyo hi jianino’tyarthamaharh sa ca mama priya’—this expression
means that when a devotee has realized ‘Vasudevah sarvam’,
then between that devotee and God there is relationship of
true love alone, nothing else. In the scriptures, this has been
called every moment—increasing love and infinite bliss.

Comment:— | SO |
'Udarah sarva evaite'—All these are noble. The term ‘Udarah' -
(noble), has several interpretations— _
(1) In the eleventh verse of the fourth chapter Lord Krsna
declares, ""Howsoever men approach Me, even so do I seek them.” |
A devotee, likes God and so does God like a devotee. But, a :
devotee is noble, because he accepts his ‘affinity and surrenders -
himself first to God. He does not bother, whether God calls him
His own or not. _ oe a
' (2) Devotees of the gods (deva) perform oblation, charity,
penance etc., following the rules for fruits. The gods, grant
them boons, as desired by devotees, without thinking of the
welfare of devotees. But, God grants only boons, which are
for their welfare and which enhance their devotion. He does
not grant boons, by which their devotion is not enhanced
and they may be entangled in the world, because He is the
supreme. father and the greatest well-wisher. So, the devotees
of God, worship Him, not caring whether their desires are

In divine love, the lover surrenders himself to his Beloved
and identifies himself with Him. Similarly, the Beloved also

surrenders Himself to His lover. So they identify themselves,
with each other. This union in the Discipline of Knowledge,

(love), it increases every moment, and in it the lover and the
Beloved even having separate entities, are one and in spite of,
being identified with each other, are two. This love cannot

of divine love, between a lover and the Beloved, continues
for infinite years, in. infinite forms. There develops such an.

of wisdom by being steadfast in mind, remains established in
God, who is supreme and above whom, there is none. Such
a devotee remaining unaffected by favourable or unfavourable .
circumstances, is always absorbed. in Him. He has a firm
belief, that only God is his, and that affinity is enhanced in
both desirable and undesirable circumstances. Thus, hé remains :
firmly established in Him. °°
Appendix—The worldly seekér of wealth instead of yearning
for God, wants only wealth, therefore he is a devotee of _
falsehood; fraud and dishonesty etc. From his heart he attaches
much importance to wealth, therefore he is not generous’ (noble) -
but he is very miserly. Therefore the term ‘generous’ is not .
‘applicable to him. But the seeker of wealth; who is a devotee
of God, from his heart does not attach importance to ‘wealth |
but attaches importance to:God. So-he is not miserly but: he
is generous (noble). Therefore ‘the. Lord has called him noble.
Here generous (noble) means renunciation. The seeker of wealth, 7
the sufferer and the seeker of knowledge—all these devotees
having renounced :the world: (pleasure and prosperity) have
started worshipping God—this is their renunciation. Therefore
all of them are noble—‘udarah. sarve evaite’. Because of the
predominance of their relationship with only God,.the seeker
of wealth, the sufferer and the seeker of knowledge also
afterwards naturally become ‘Jani’ (devotees).
.. There is a vital point that atheism is more defective. than a
desire. Those who, instead of worshipping God, worship other
deities, if they are desire-ridden, they follow the cycle of birth
and. death—‘gatagatarh kama kama labhante’ (Gita 9/21). But
those who worship only God, if any desire remains in them,
then by. God’s grace and by the influence of their: worship,
they attain God. The reason is that if a man is connected with
"
933,"896 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 7
God in anyway, he attains only God* because basically he is a
fragment of God. 7
The seeker of wealth, the sufferer and the seeker of
_ _knowledge—all the three have been called ‘noble’ by God. But
those who don’t worship God but worship other deities, the
_ Lord instead of calling them noble, have called them men of
meagre intellect (Gita 7/23) and their worship has been called |
as the worship in a mistaken manner (Gita 9/23). Their worship
is in a mistaken manner because they regard gods as different
from God viz., they don’t regard gods as the manifestation of
God and moreover they are desire-ridden. It means that ‘not
to behold God in all’ is more harmful than ‘to work with an ~
interested motive’ because in the former there is no relation with ;
the sentient (divinity) (God). Po |
An enlightened (self-realized). soul has his ‘tattvika ekt@’ —~
(unity in essence) viz., ‘Sadharmata’ (merger into God’s Being)
with the Supreme but a devotee has his ‘atmiya ekta’ viz., he
becomes the Lord’s own self—‘Jnani tvatmaiva me matam’. In
‘tattvika unity’ (Sadharmata), there is ‘abheda’ between the self
and Brahma viz., as Brahma is truth, consciousness and bliss —~
solidified, similarly he also becomes. truth, consciousness and
bliss solidified and nothing else remains besides the Supreme
Reality. But in a devotee’s “atmiya’ unity the self and God
become ‘abhinna’ (inseparable). In this “abhinnata’ the devotee
and the Lord in spite of being one, become two in order to
exchange love with each other. In this state both are lovers
and both are beloved (Sometimes God is the lover and the
devotee is the beloved and vice versa). Therefore in spite of

being two, they remain only one. | Oo ,
A man (the self) is a fragment of God. The more disinclination
he has for God, the more his ego is inflated; and the more
inclination he has to God, the more his ego is wiped out. Even .
after being established in the self, he can have an iota (trace)
of subtle ego. But in devotion living in developed oneness with
God through devotion, a devotee’s attachment to the lower nature
(apara prakrti) is totally renounced and his ego is totally wiped
out because ego is the evolute of apara prakrti. Therefore the
Lord declares—jiiani tvatmaiva me matam’ (a Jiiani viz., devout
devotee is verily My own self): | Se -
A seeker of wealth, a sufferer and a seeker of knowledge, ;
gradually lose their independent entity (ego), while a Jnani
(devotee) has no independent entity. Therefore the expression ~
‘tvatmaiva’ means that a lover (devotee with exclusive devotion)
has no independent entity besides God and only God remains
viz., the lover becomes the manifestation of God—tasminstajjane
bhedabhavat (Narada. 41). This ‘atmiyata’ (intimacy) with God
is dualism for devotion which a devotee accepts himself in
order to enhance devotion and it is far superior to the non-
dualism of Jiiaénayoga—‘bhaktyarthath kalpitarn (svikrtarh)
dvaitamadvaitadapi sundaram’* (Bodhasara, Bhakti. 42).
‘Mamevanuttamam gatim’—There is no other Supreme goal
besides God. The term ‘gati’ has three meanings—knowledge,
speed (act of going) and attainment. Here the term ‘gati’ has
been used for attainment. Being the final attainable Reality, God
is the Supreme goal to be attained. - a
‘Asthitah’—One steadiness is gained by practice and the
other steadiness is natural. As every being feels ‘I am’—this is

. ""Bahiinam janmandmante'—This human. birth, is the last
of all. births. The Lord, has given man full right to be free,
from the cycle of birth and death. But man,. because of his -
attachment, for the world, failing to attain Him, returns to the
path of the mortal world. (Gita 9/3). So Lord Krsna,. while
describing men possessing demoniacal traits, declares that such
fools, instead of attaining Him, sink into still lower and baser,
depths (Gita 16/20). CF

Itis mentioned in the scriptures and in the utterances of saints,
that the only aim of human life, is to attain salvation, it is not for
enjoying the pleasures of the world, and heaven: Therefore, in
the Gita, such people who look upon heaven as a supreme goal
are called unwise, (2/42) and of meagre intelligence (7/23).

‘This human life, is the very first and the very last, of all
births. It is the first, because the actions performed during this
human life lead him to, eighty-four lac forms of lives and hell
and in these forms of lives and hells he has to suffer pains
"
936,"Verse 19} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 899
and tortures,’ because of the vices he committed in the course |
of a human life. It is the very last, because a man can attain
salvation or God-realization and be free, from the cycle of birth |
and death. , ) , a | Be
Lord Krsna, in the sixth verse of the eighth chapter, declares, -
“Whatever being a man thinks of, when he leaves his body at :
the time of death, that alone does he attain."" Therefore, the Lord
has given him independence to think of the Lord, and attain ,
salvation. Thus the Gita, declares openly, ""Even the vilest sinner
and those who are of inferior birth, because of their sins of the |
previous birth, by taking refuge in Me, attain the Supreme Goal”
(9/30—33). The Lord, has used the terms 'Papa yonayah' (born 7
of the sinful womb). It means that creatures of the inferior birth, ==
such as pariah, animals, birds, msects, trees and creepers etc., all :
can. be included. But, the. difference between man.and creatures. -
of inferior births, is that man because of his. discrimination, can
follow the spiritual path, while other.creatures cannot. But being
fragments of God, all of them have got the right, to attain Him. =
Yet, many of the creatures because of God's and saints’ grace,
as well as, the influence of a place of ‘pilgrimage etc., attain :
salvation. The gods, hanker after pleasures, in heaven. So they —_—
do not think of their salvation. But if they also think of God- =
realization due to any circumstances, they can realize, Him. It -
is. mentioned in the scriptures, that Indra, the king of the gods, -
had true knowledge. The Lord, has bestowed this human life, the -
very last of all births upon us, so that we may attain salvation.
So, if, we just become instrument in his hand. and be subservient
to His will, we can attain salvation, undoubtedly. . 7
_ A man should not misuse the independence given to him
by God, by working against the ordinance of scriptures and
against. his own discrimination. In that state, of the right use ==
of independence, either he will do nothing, or. act according to :
ordinance of scriptures: If he has no interest for doing anything for |
"
937,"900 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 7
himself, :he will cease his affinity with senses, mind and intellect
etc. The:reason is, that when-he has desire to do something, a
sense of doership is born and he. has affinity: for senses and
| mind. He has affinity for the fruit of action, when he acts for
himself. When he does nothing, there will neither be a sense of
doership, nor desire for fruit and thus he will be established in
_ the self. If he works according to ordinance of.scriptures, without
- expecting a fruit for actions, the momentum for actions perishes,
and his affinity with actions and things, breaks off and then new
desires do not evolve, and old attachment perishes. Thus he
automatically realizes the truth in the self (Gita 4/38). |
Lord Krsna in the Gita, declares—One who works without —
having any desire for the fruit of actions, all his actions melt _
away (4/23). One will be saved from all sins, by means of
knowledge (4/36). The Lord, liberates His devotees, from all —
sins (18/66). He, who knows God as unborn and beginningless,
is purged; of all sins.(10/3). In this way, a devotee is purged of __
all sins, through all the three Disciplines of Action, Knowledge
and Devotion. It means, that the aim of human birth, the very
last of all births, is nothing besides, salvation. | ;
_ If we have got good company, sacred books such as the Git,
and realized the importance of the name of the Lord, it means
that God by His special grace, has given us an opportunity,
to attain ‘salvation. But, it does not mean that we should stop
adoration. etc. We should devote, our time and ‘energy, to attain
Him by becoming an instrument, in His hands. If He had not
decided to liberate us, from the cycle of birth and death, He by
His grace, would not have bestowed this human birth, upon us
(whose only aim is.to attain God-realization). So, with a firm
faith, that we'll attain salvation, we should follow a spiritual
path, by becoming an instrument,.in His. hands. |
.A question may arise, that this human birth may be a fruit of
virtuous actions of his previous birth. If-we accept this assumption,
"
938,"Verse 19] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI Oi |
we come to know that even animals, birds and insects etc., also
get the fruit of their previous actions. If it were so, there would
be no difference, between men and other.creatures. In that case,
it would not. be correct to say, that human life has been bestowed Be
upon us, by the kind grace of God. Then. how can we regard
human life, unique and glorious? The glory of human life; lies —
in surrendering ourselves to God and attaining salvation.*

''Vasudevah sarvam'—In the beginning of the universe, God
Himself assumes different forms. and at the time of its dissolution,
only God remains. Thus, when at the beginning and the end, there
is none besides God, how can someone else, be besides God,
in the middle? This creation, has evolved out of Himself only.
There was no other material, with Him besides Him. Therefore,
the whole universe is nothing, besides His manifestation.

_ As in the case of ornaments, made of gold, there is nothing

besides gold, as in the earthenware vessels there is nothing besides -
clay, and in toys made of sugar, there is nothing besides sugar, -
so in the universe, there is nothing besides God. So long as, a
man is preoccupied with the beauty and forms of ornaments, he -
does not pay attention to the purity of gold. Similarly, so long
as a man attaches importance to the world, he does not discern
God, he does not perceive that ""All is God."" | a,

to the brim with divine bliss, and.then for him, nothing further
remains.to be done, to be known and to be achieved. ©
_ For such a devotee, following. the Discipline of Devotion,
the so-called world, becomes divine: Being absorbed in God the
body of a devotee also becomes unearthly or divine, as Mirabai's
body merged into God's idol. In devotion, towards the Lord first
there are three different entities—service, servant (devotee) and
master (God). But when there is complete devotion, the devotee . -
in the form of service merges into the master, and only the

‘Vasudevah Sarvam'—Divinity can be understood, in two :
ways—(1) The world has no existence, only God exists, (2)
All is God viz., this world is the manifestation of God.
Strivers can follow, either of the two ways. Those, who are
attached to the world should follow the first path, while those -
who are totally detached from the world and are engaged in
meditation and adoration etc., should follow the second path.
Though both, are one and the same, yet there seems to be _
a difference- in them in the same way as, there’ seems: to be
difference in different kinds of ornaments of gold and the gold :
itself. In the former, there is predominance of discrimination, -
while in the latter there is predominance of devotion (faith).
Devotees who worship attributeless God attach importance, to -
discrimination, while those who worship the Lord, with attributes
attach importance, to devotion. == - ~~ a
But in fact; both of these are the same. Therefore, Lord Krsna,
in the Discipline of Knowledge, has used acceptarice inthe sense
of knowledge (3/28) while in the Discipline of Devotion, He has
used knowledge in the sense of acceptance (5/29; 9/13; 10/3, 7,
24; 27, 41). There is one point which needs attention—To know
God orto accept Him both is knowledge, while to know the
world, as having its own separate existence, or to accept it as
real both is ignorance. oO a |
_ By knowing, the reality about the world, the world loses its
existence, and by knowing reality about God, one realizes, Him.
Similarly, by accepting firmly, that the world is a manifestation
of the Lord, the world, is seen as divine manifestation. Thus, by

realizing divinity, knowledge and faith, become one,
om jiianavanmath prapadyate'—Those, who accept the
existence of the kaleidoscopic world, are ignorant and foolish, ~ |
while those who understand that the Lord pervades everywhere,
in different forms, are learned and wise. Only the Lord is, at all
places, in all beings and in all forms—this is realization of, a
wise devotee. Therefore, in the nineteenth verse of the fifteenth _
chapter, he has been called ‘Sarvavit' viz., he has known all,
what was to be known. © 7 ee
_ The surrender of a-man of wisdom, is different from that of
a sufferer, the seeker of knowledge, and a seeker of wealth. So,
the Lord has called him His own self (7/18) because according
to him, there is none other entity, besides the Lord. The Lord
- Himself declares, 'Like clusters of yarn-beads formed by knots on = -
_ a thread, all this is threaded on Me' (7/7). As in a rosary made of
yarn-beads, there is nothing besides yarn, so in the world, there _
is nothing, besides God. One who realizes this fact, .is said to ~
take refuge, in Him. This realization is, real surrender to Him.

'Sa mahatma sudurlabhah'—Some of the people, never think ~
of God-realization. A few think of it, but they have no. exclusive
devotion, for Him. A few make efforts, but soon lose heart, because
of their ignorance in realizing Him. They miss this excellent
opportunity, and thus, are deprived of the highest gain.

The Lord Himself, in the third verse of this chapter, declared,

""Among thousands of men, scarcely one strives to realize Me,
_and of those who strive, scarcely one, knows Me in truth.” The
truth is ""All is God.” Such a great soul, is rare indéed. It does
not mean that God cannot be realized, without facing several
hurdles. But, it means that such devotees, who want to realize
God from the core of their hearts, are rare. If a devotee wants
to realize Him, he can realize Him, because the human birth's
purpose, is nothing else, besides realizing Him. a

All the people cannot enjoy worldly prosperity and pleasure,
"

equally but all of them can realize God, as was realized by Lord |
Sankara, Narada, Vasistha, Sanaka-Sanandana and other sages, ae
and ascetics etc. So, a man should never miss such‘a golden |
opportunity. — | - -
The Lord, possesses an unparalleled trait that He reveals
Himself as food for the hungry, water for the thirsty, pleasure
for the seekers of pleasure and also, as person, senses, mind,
intellect and thoughts etc. In the form of pain, He warns us, that
pain is the result of enjoyment of pleasure. So, if one enjoys
sensual pleasure, he will have to suffer. So, he should not enjoy
pleasure because, these are nothing besides the Lord and the Lord -
has to reveal Himself‘as pleasure for him. But how gracious the
Lord is, that He reveals Himself as a creature desires! Such a
great soul who realizes that, all is God, is very rare.
There was an ascetic, who worshipped God Ganesa. He had
an idol of Ganega, and another one of a rat, both made of gold.
Both of these weighed equally. Once the ascetic decided to go on -
a pilgrimage. He went to a goldsmith to sell them. The goldsmith
weighed them and told the ascetic, that the value of each of .
the two was the same. At this the ascetic grew angry with the
goldsmith and asked him how a vehicle could be equal, in value
to the Lord. The goldsmith replied, ""Sir, I am not buying either
God Gane§a, or his vehicle, the rat. I buy gold. So I shall pay
you according to their weight."" Thus, as a goldsmith does not
notice Lord Gane§a or his vehicle, he sees only gold. So does
a great soul behold God, he does not, see the world.

down to make water, in the field, of a farmer. The farmer,

realized his mistake, and said, ""Sir, forgive me for my mistake;

‘Vasudevah’ (God) is real. The unreal has no existence and the

teal never ceases to be—‘nasato vidyate bhivo nabhavo vidyate

satah’ (Gita 2/16). It means that only the real exists, the unreal has BS

no existence at all. There is only God (Vasudeva), all (Sarvam) is

not there. But the strivers, who speak, who hear and who study,

hold that there is existence of ‘Sarvam’ (world), therefore the |

Lord in order to Wipe out this wrong ‘notion of ‘sarvam’ (world) |

utters ‘Vasudevah sarvam’. Be oo

Inthe scriptures different types of yogis have been described

such as Jfidnayogi, Dhyanayogi, Layayogi, Hathayogi, Rajayogi, .

Mantrayogi and Anasaktayogi etc., but the Lord does not declare

that they are very rare. But He declares that the exalted soul

who realizes ‘All is God’ is very rare indeed. -
God is the seed of the entire world—‘yaccApi sarvabhiitanam

bijarh tadahamarjuna’ (Gita 10/39), ‘bijarh mar sarvabhitanarh :

viddhi partha sanatanam’ (Gita 7/10). Whatever products .are ~

produced from a kind of seed, they are‘the different forms of

that seed only. The crop produced from wheat is the wheat-crop -

only. The farmers say that there is a .good crop of wheat, the

field is full of wheat (it appears to be merely grass and there

is not even.a single grain of wheat. in it). But a businessman

of a city will not accept that this is wheat. He will say that he

has bought and ‘sold so many bags of wheat. and tf he does not

know what the wheat is; it is grass, in it there are stalks and

leaves, it is not wheat. But a farmer, who cultivates the field,

will say, “This is not grass which amimals eat, but it is wheat.”

If a cow grazes plants of the wheat, the farmer says, “Your cow

has grazed our wheat”, while she has not eaten even a single

grain of wheat. In the field even a single grain of wheat may

not be seen, but the crop is wheat—in it there is no doubt.

The reason is that first the seed of wheat was sown and when

the crop is ripe, wheat will be taken ‘out, and so in the mid

state also it is only wheat. Now it appears to be green grass
"
947,"910. SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA. . {Chapter7

- but when the crop is ripe, the wheat will be taken out of it. In

this way God existed before the origin of the world—‘sadeva
somyedamagra asidekamevadvitiyam’ (Chandogya. 6/2/1), andin =~

the end also God will remain—‘Sisyate Sesasarnjiiah’ (Srimadbhi.

10/3/25). Therefore in. the mid state also all is only God—

| ‘Vasudevah Sarvam’. : | Oo :

___ So long as a striver has the egoistic notion, he is a ‘bhogi’
(voluptuary). I am a yogi—this is the enjoyment of yoga; I am
wise—this is enjoyment of wisdom; I am a lover—this is the

_ enjoyment of love. So long as he enjoys pleasures, there is
possibility of his downfall. He who enjoys yoga, can also enjoy :
| objects of senses; he who enjoys knowledge, can also enjoy
ignorance and he who enjoys love, can also enjoy attachment.
The reason is that he is possessed of such disposition, the habit —-
for pleasure. When he no longer remains ‘bhogi’ (voluptuous),
then only Yoga persists. With the persistence of yoga, a man
attains salvation. But-even after having attained salvation, the —
_ exalted soul has the latent impression (a subtle iota of ego)
(Sarnskira) of the spiritual discipline by which he attained — -
salvation. This latent impression of ego does not let him be
one with other philosophers. This is also because of the latent —__
impression that there are differences:among philosophers and their
philosophical thoughts. The latent impression of a particular sect
does ‘not let the philosopher of that sect respect.the sects of other
philosophers. But when the love, which increases every moment,
is attained, then the latent impression of his sect does not persist,
he becomes one with other philosophers, all differences come
to an end and ‘Vasudevah sarvam’ is realized. In fact then the
exalted ‘soul; who realizes, ‘all:is God’ who knows it and. who
- mentions it loses his identity and only God remains Who is the
same ‘from the time immemorial. By ‘beholding .God in all, all —
sects are equally respected because it is not possible to oppose
one’s. own favourite God—‘nija prabhumaya dekhahim. jagata
-- kehi sana karahirh birodha’ (Manasa, Uttara. 112b). Co

_ . There are two types of description about God and the soul—
(i).God is the ocean and the soul is.its wave viz., the wave
-belongs to. the ocean and, (ii) the. soul. (self) is the ocean: and Soe eo
God is its wave viz., the ocean belongs to the wave. Out of these

two the wave belongs to the sea—this assumption seems to be
proper. The ocean belongs to the wave—this assumption does

not seem proper because the ocean is, comparatively enduring :
while the wave, is transient. Therefore the wave: belongs to the
sea, the sea does not belong to the wave. If a striver regards
himself as the sea and God as the wave, it will be very improper — |
because by this assumption the sense of ego will be inculcated -
and ego: will remain, eternal while God will. become transient.

The reason is that the. self has maintained the sense of ego
(individuality) from time immemorial. Therefore if we call the
self as. ‘I’ (ego), it is the..same.ego which we have maintained
since time immemorial. Salvation is attained when this ego is :
-wiped out. Besides the above-mentioned two assumptions, there -
is the third remarkable fact.that in water-element there is neither
the sea nor the wave. viz., there.is:no distinction of the sea and
the wave. This is the truth. Fhe sea and the wave are relative

terms but ‘the water-element is. independent (having nothing to

do with the:sea or the wave).-... ~~ - |
_ As in‘'water-element, the sea, the river;-rain, dew; fog, steam

and cloud etc., all: having lost their identity (individuality) become

one, ‘similarly in ‘Vasudevah sarvam’ (all is God), all spiritual
disciplines having lost their identity become one as God. As
in water-element there is no difference of forms, similarly in
‘Vasudevah sarvam’ there is no difference of opinions. Differences
in opinions (sects) cause dissatisfaction but in ‘Vasudevah sarvam’,
as there are no differences of opinions, so all are totally satisfied.
In ‘Vasudevah sarvam’ there is neither a Yogi, nor a Jfiani nor a
Premi—so the exalted soul, who has realized it, is very rare indeed.

Water is chan ged into. different forms such as snow, fog,
"
949,"912 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA | [Chapter7

cloud, hail, rain, river, pond and sea etc. If snow is put in a deep

frying pan and the frying pan is put on fire, the snow melts into

water. Then water is evaporated and then the steam by becoming -

atoms becgmes shapeless. Water assumes the form of fog, it

assumes the form of a cloud, the same becomes shapeless, the

same assumes the form of snow, the same assumes the shape

of hail, the same in the form of rain falls on the earth, the

same assumes the form of a river and the same water assumes

the form of the sea. In spite of assuming so many forms, the

water as an element remains the same. Similarly God assumes

numberless forms. As water being very cold turns into snow

or ice and becoming liquid by heat turns into steam (vapour) ;

and then is changed into the form of atoms; similarly God by

getting cold in the form of ignorance, appears in the form of

inert world, and by the heat in the form of knowledge appears -

in the form of subtle and sentient God. Water may appear in .

the form of snow or vapour or cloud etc., but, essentially it is ;

only water. It is nothing else besides water. Similarly God may

appear in the form of the world and in other forms but He is

only God. There is none else besides God. -
A striver commits an error that keeping himself aloof (separate)

he wants to behold the world as the manifestation of God viz.,

he perceives ‘all is God’ with his intellect. In fact not only the

world, which is beheld as the manifestation of God but he who

sees it is also the manifestation of God—‘sakalamidamaharh ca

vasudevah’ (Visnu puraria 3/7/32). Therefore a striver should

assume that all including his body is only God viz., the body is

the manifestation of God, senses are also His manifestation; the

mind is also His manifestation, intellect is also His manifestation,

the life-breath is also His manifestation and ego (I’ness) is also

the Lord’s manifestation. All is God—in order to accept this

reality a striver should not apply his intellect but naturally without

making any effort, should accept the truth as it is. Therefore in

Srimadbhagavata it is mentioned— | :

When ‘all is God’—it is determined then a striver by this
spiritual science being free from all kinds of doubts, by beholding .
God everywhere, should. become tranquil viz., ‘all is God’—he
should not think of it but God should be clearly seen to him. | |
It means that ‘all is God’—he (the self) should remain
indifferent to this notion also viz., there should remain neither
the seer (one who: sees), nor the seen (which is seen) nor the
seeing (the action of seeing), but only God should. remain. -
‘*Vasudevah sarvam’—can be realized in different ways— __
(i) Actions, objects and persons have a beginning and an
end but the self ever remains the same. Therefore a man realizes -
that actions, objects and persons are perishing but the self never |
perishes. This realization from the discrimination point of view _
is the realization of “Vasudevah sarvam’ (all is God).
(ii) Before the creation of the universe only God existed and
in the end also God will exist, then how can there be anyone
else besides God in the mid-state? This is from the reasoning
point of view ‘Vasudevah sarvam’. |
(iti) Only God is,-mine, besides God none is mine and if
there is anyone else, let him be, what have we to do with him? |
This is from a simple, straightforward, believer-devotee’s point
of view “Vasudevah sarvam’. As in Vraja a sage was talking to
some one near the well, “Brahma (the Supreme) is so and so and
the soul is so etc.” A cowherds woman came there to draw water
from the well, she heard the conversation and asked the other
cowherds woman, “What are these Brahma and the soul?” The
other woman said, “They should be our beloved’s kith and kin,
therefore these sages are talking about them, otherwise what have
they to do with anyone else besides our beloved Lala (Krsna)?

has been led astray). But the persons described here have the

predominance of desires; so they are ‘hrtajfianah’,

_ The seekers of wealth and the afflicted devotees take refuge -
in. only.God but these persons leaving God. aside, take refuge in
other deities. Desires, deities, men and precepts—all these are
various. If in spite of having several desires, only God is to be _
worshipped, then He will lead the devotee (worshipper) to salvation.

But if desires are numerous and the deities worshipped are also
numerous, then who will lead. such a person to salvation? -
There is no other entity besides God—this knowledge is
veiled because of the desire for pleasure. The desire has been . -
caused neither by prakrti nor by God but it has been caused
(made) by a man himself. Therefore it-is his responsibility to
wipe it out. The Lord by the term..‘hrtajnanah’ means to say that
the discrimination has not been destroyed but because of desire
it has been carried away. The same. fact has been mentioned
in the Gita by the expressions, ‘mayayapahrtajianah’ (7/15),
‘ajtanenavrtam jilanam’ (5/15) etc. . OO
In the fifteenth. verse of this. chapter, in the expression
‘mayayapahrtajfianah’ there. is predominance of the mode of
ignorance while the mode of passion is secondary, but in
the expression ‘“kamaistaistairhrtajianah’ used here, there is
predominance of the mode of passion and the mode of ignorance
is. secondary. In the expression “mayayapahrtajnanah’ there is
predominance of the desire for wealth and in ‘kamaistaistairhrta-

jianah’ there. is predominance of the desire for pleasure. The
difference between the two is that the men deluded, deprived
of discrimination. by Maya, don’t worship gods but the men Se
whose discrimination has: been led astray by desires can worship
gods. The reason is that there is no distaste for wealth—‘jimi
pratiladbha lobha adhikai’ but there is certainly distaste
for pleasures.. In ‘mayaydpahrtajiianah’ a man depends on
demoniac traits such as falsehood, fraud and dishonesty etc., but in
‘kamaistaistairhrtajianah’ there is dependence on God. Therefore
in ‘mayayapahrtajiianah’ there is special inertness (insentience)

answer is, that He stabilizes their faith not only in gods, but in

change their wish,. because they have discrimination which is a
, divine gift to every human being. Had they been weak, incapable
and helpless, in. changing their inclinations (desire), then where .
is the glory in this human birth? By using this discrimination,
they can kill the enemy in the form of desire (3/43). |

The man who lacks something, tends to make the other -

He make anyone His servant-(dependent)? But if a man wants
to become a servant of God, He does not.refuse and. accepts -
him as a servant by showering His grace. This is His special
generosity. As a man by seeing a lovely child gets pleased, it
does not mean that the man has any selfish motive. Similarly
when anyone becomes a servant of God, He is delighted with
his simple heartedness—‘morerh adhika dasa para priti’ (Manasa,
Uttara. 16/4). In the eighteenth chapter of the Gita when the
Lord asks Arjuna to do as he wishes—‘yathecchasi tatha kuru’
and Arjuna is very much perturbed, then the Lord out of His
grace says to Arjuna in order to console him, ‘Take refuge in
Me alone’—‘mamekarh Saranarh vraja’ (18/66). But before this
utterance, the Lord says to Arjuna that this is the Supreme
secret (18/64) and afterwards He forbids Arjuna to unfold the
Supreme secret to everyone (18/67). It proves that though the
Lord has no intention of making anyone His servant, yet if a
man, without getting any other support, is perturbed and wants to
become His servant, He out of His grace, accepts him. It means
that if a man has faith in a deity, God makes his faith firm in

By using the phrase ‘Alpamedhasam', (meagre intellect),
Lord Krsna says, that such devotees are of meagre intellect,
because they have to undertake several vows, and follow several _
methods, but the fruit is finite and perishable. So, in the worship
of the Lord, a devotee without undertaking vows and without
following various methods, gains infinite and imperishable fruit. ~
Worshippers of the gods, follow the cycle of birth and death,
while the worshippers of the Lord, being free from the shackles -
of birth and death, attain salvation’ ~~ =~ ""7 .

'Devandevayajo yanti madbhakta yanti mamapi'—Worshippers
of the gods attain at the maximum the gods, whereas devotees of
the Lord, attain Him. As they are votaries of gods, they are not
devoted to the Lord, so their intellect is meagre and mediocre.
The devotees of God, whether they worship Him with a desire
or without a desire, attain Him. But, it is not necessary that
their desires, may be satisfied. God satisfies their desires only,

if these are for their welfare. But if they are harmful, for the
devotees, the Lord does not satisfy these. yo

Our affinity for God is eternal, but we are reminded of it
through adoration. Having attained Him, there is no return to this
world (Gita 15/6). But’our affinity with the gods, is not eternal
and therefore, having attained to them, we have to return to this

world of mortals (Gita 9/21). a Oo
“My devotees attain Me alone."" Having this feeling, the Lord
has referred to four types of devotees—seekers of worldly objects, -
-the sufferers, the seekers of knowledge and men of wisdom,
virtuous and noble (7/16—18). — . .
‘Madbhakta yanti mamapi'—It means, that even a vilest |
sinner, being His fragment may attain Him, if he abandons his
affinity, for the world which is an assumed one. — | a
The whole universe, is nothing besides, the manifestation of
‘God. But, we are unable to realize this fact, because, first we

have desires. If we accept the universe as Divine manifestation, -
our desires, will be rooted“ out, or if we root out. desires, the
- universe, will be seen.as a Divine manifestation. Then, all our -
actions will be performed, as a service to God. If both are done
together, we will be immensely and instantly benefited. :

the abode of gods from where they have to return to the mortal _
world, but the worshippers of God attain'Him only. If a striver _
regards the deity as the manifestation of God or worships him —

Some people, interpret this verse to mean that those who think

the incarnation of God, Who works as Arjuna's charioteer, as
formless, are of poor understanding.
But, both views are not correct. The reason is, that the former
will censure the Lord endowed with form, and His devotees,
while the latter will censure formless God, and the devotees
who worship a formless God. When, even the elements such as
earth, water and fire etc., can be with form and without form,
why can the Lord, not be with form and without form, with
attributes and without attributes?

in spite of being immortal, disappears and despite his being the
Lord of the whole universe, becomes an obedient son or pupil,
while in the fourth verse of the ninth chapter, He declares that

Veiled, by My divine potency (Yoga Maya), I am not manifest

and imperishable Supreme. 25 —
Comment:— : : .
'Miidho'yam nabhijanati loko mamajamavyayam'—I am
unborn and imperishable (i.e.,) free from birth and death. But,
I stage a play of My revelation, and disappearance. In spite of -
being unborn, I incarnate and in spite of, being imperishable,
I disappear, in the same way as the sun rises and sets. Thus, |
those who know Me without birth and death, are undeluded - |
(Gita 10/3, 15/19). But those, who regard Me, as the Lord of
creation, yet an ordinary mortal, subject to birth and death, are -
fools (Gita 9/11).
The reason, why a man does not regard the Lord, as unborn
and imperishable, is that he by forgetting his real affinity with
Him, by error he has accepted his affinity with this body, ""I am
this body and this body is mine.” It is because, of this veil, that
he regards the Lord, as born and dead.
Men do not regard Him, as unborn and imperishable,
because of two factors—One, is that He is concealed by His
divine potency, and the second is due to their own folly. It can
be explained, by an illustration. A man, remains confined to his
house which is shut. He is free to go out of his house. But, he
is unable to cross the walls round the city, when the gate of the __
walls, is shut. But, a king can open the gate of the city, and
also force the sentry to open the gate of his house. Similarly, a
"
965,"$28 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 7
man can get rid of his folly. But he can realize God only, by
God's. grace. Only, he whom God enables to realize Him, can
know Him. If a man surrenders himself to Him, He removes his _
ignorance, as well as, His deluding potency.
‘Naham prakasah sarvasya yogamayasamavrtah'—I, am not
manifest, to a group of ignorant people, because they instead
of recognizing Me, as unborn and imperishable Supreme-Spirit,
neglect Me considering Me, as an ordinary man. It means, that
I hide myself in My divine potency, to those, who regard Me
as mortal, and I am not manifest to them. But, I am manifest to
those, who having faith in Me, regard Me as unborn, imperishable .
and the Lord, of the whole creation.
The Lord's divine potency, is strange and uncommon. Men °
see God, who is hidden ‘by His divine potency, .according to _
their own sentiments.* 7
Here, the Lord has declared, that those who do not recognize
Him as unborn and imperishable, are ignorant, while in the second -
verse of the tenth chapter, He declares, that neither gods nor great
sages, know the secret of His birth. So, a doubt arises why the -
Lord has declared, those who do not recognize Him as unborn
and imperishable, as ignorant, while He has not declared those
gods and sages ignorant, who do not know, the secret of His
birth. The clarification is,. that. the Lord Himself, has declared,
that He is the origin of all the gods and great sages, and as
a child cannot see the birth of his father, the gods and sages,
cannot know the secret of His birth; but men can accept Him,
as unborn and imperishable. If they do not do so, they are
called, ignorant. : |
* When Lord Krsna along with Balarama came to the arena, he seemed
diamond-hard to wrestlers, a virtuous person to common men, Cupid, the god of
love to women, a kinsman to cowherds, a strict ruler to the cunning kings, a child to
elderly people, death to Kamsa, gigantic to the ignorant, cosmic soul to the ascetics
and favourite God to the devotees of the Vrsni clan. (Srimadbha. 10/43/17)

I Know, O Arjuna, the created beings of the past, the present
and the future, but the ignorant one, does not know Me. 26
Comment:— | : -
'Veddham samatitani vartamanani carjuna bhavisyani ca
bhitaéni m4m tu veda na kaScana'—Here, the Lord has used
three adjectives, to express the past, the present and the future
for the beings, but for Himself, He has used only the present.
It means that in God's eye, the past, the future and the present
are simply present. So, He knows all the beings of the past, the
future and the present. As in a movie, the incidents, for persons
seeing a movie seem to occur in the past, the future and the
"
967,"930 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 7
present, while in the film they are all in the present. Similarly,
from the view-point of beings, there is distinction between the
past, the future and the present, but in reality, there is only the :
present, because the beings are within a limit of time, while the
Lord is beyond the limit of time. Time, things, men, incidents
and circumstances etc., change, while God ever remains the same.
Knowledge of the beings, who are bound by time, is limited, .
while knowledge of God, is limitless. The beings, by practising
Yoga, enhance their knowledge, but that knowledge, is limited.
Such Yogis, are called ""Yufijana Yogi (the ascetics who are
practising austerities, but have not attained final beatitude). The -
Lord, is 'Yukta Yogr i.e., He knows ali beings and the whole
world, all the time, without practising Yoga. All beings of the
past, the future and the present, constantly abide in God; they _
can never be separated from Him. It is beyond His power, to
separate Himself, from them. So, they can never escape, His
observation. ~ :
‘Mam tu veda na kaScana'—It means, that the ignorant folk,
who do not recognize Me, as unborn and imperishable, but regard -
Me as an ordinary man, do not know Me, but I know, all of |
them. As a man from inside, can see the outerside through a
curtain made from split bamboo sticks, hung on the door, but
a man from outside the door, cannot see inside through it, the
ignorant people, veiled by the curtain of divine potency, cannot
see the Lord, while He can see all of them.
Now, a doubt arises, that as the Lord knows the future of
all beings, it means that man's emancipation and bondage, are
also predestined. Then, how can a man attain emancipation, or
salvation, by making efforts? -
The clarification is, that God has bestowed upon man, this
last life. Now, it is upto him whether he attains salvation or he
has a downfall (Gita 7/27; 8/6), it is not decided by God.
The Lord Himself, in the nineteenth verse of this chapter,
"
968,"Verse 26] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI - 931.

declares, ""In the very last of all births viz., in this human burth,

man of wisdom, takes refuge in Me, realizing that, all this is

God. Such, a great soul is rare indeed."". It means, that men are —

free to attain salvation, or God-realization. If a man's rebirth —

in a particular womb, is predecided by God, it means that man .

is not free, in attaining salvation and there is.no recourse for .

sanction and prohibition, preached by God, saints and preceptors, 3

and in scriptures. Moreover, the Lord's declarations, ""Whatever

form any devotee with faith wishes to worship, that faith of his,

I make steady"" (7/21) and ""Thinking of whatever being he at

the end, gives up his body, to that being, does he attain"" (8/6)

will prove futile and man's worship and the freedom bestowed

upon him, of the last thought, which determines his next birth,

will also go, in vain. : 7 -
The Lord by His grace bestows this human body, so that

a man may attain salvation. In the thirty-third verse of the

eleventh chapter, Lord Krsna says to Arjuna, ""These warriors -

have already been slain by Me. You, be merely an instrument.""

Similarly, the Lord, has bestowed upon men all the resources, -

for attaining salvation by His grace. He should merely become

an instrument in his hand. The Lord also declares, ""By receiving _

this boat, in the form of a human body and favourable wind,

in the form of My grace, one, who does not attain salvation,

commits, suicide"" (Srimadbha. 11/20/17). In the Gita, it is also

declared, ""Seeing the same Lord dwelling equally in all, he does

not kill his self, by the self and thereby reaches, the supreme

state"" (Gita 13/28). It proves that the Lord has bestowed upon

human beings, the right, resources and understanding, so that they

can attain salvation. If they do not attain salvation, by receiving

this priceless opportunity, they commit suicide and follow the |

cycle of birth and death. If on receiving this human body, a man

makes proper use of the resources, without working against the

ordinance of scriptures and God, his salvation is axiomatic, and :

there is no obstacle to it. : . ;
"
969,"932 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 7
_ Thus, a man should have a firm determination, to make the
best possible use of his resources, in accordance with the scriptures.
But, if they are misused by an error, he should have a burning - 7
sensation, and pray to God, ""O God, I regret for my error. Give
me power, so that I may not deviate from your ordinances and
principles."" In such cases, God's help is certain.

| Man's inability can be of two kinds—First, a man is not able
to do a piece of work, because he has not got enough power, just
as a servant, cannot lift a house and carry it, if desired by his
master. Secondly, that he has the power and can do the work,
but because of indolence, he does not do it. A striver, suffers -
from the latter sort of inability. In order, to do away with this _
inability, a striver should pray to God.

God can never wish that a human being may have to take, so -
many births, because He-has given him freedom, to attain salvation. /
Not only this, the Lord would not wish countless animate and _ |
inanimate beings, to take births. God, does not force a man to
follow the cycle of birth and death. Other beings, besides men,
follow this cycle of birth and death according to the fruit of their :
actions. But, if anyone of those beings, either in human birth or
even in any other birth, takes refuge in the Lord, He liberates
him, from sins of infinite births (Manasa 5/44/1).

Appendix—Here a doubt may arise that when the Lord

_ knows all beings, it means that a man’s bondage and salvation
are predestined because the Lord’s knowledge is eternal. This
doubt arises because we assume the existence of the world and
we value the world (it is our point of view). From the view-
point of God and exalted souls, the world has no existence,
only God exists—*Vasudevah sarvam’. Because of ego we have
assumed the existence of the world and have valued it. Therefore
the Lord talks about the past, the present and the future in our
language. If He does not speak in our language, how shall we
understand? As, if a teacher of English language who wants
"
970,"Verse 26] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 933
to teach us English, uses only English, we shall not be able to
learn English. .

The knowledge of God is eternal. All is within the knowledge ~ 7
of God. There is nothing else besides Him—‘mattah paratararh
nanyatkincidasti’ (Gita 7/7). The embodied soul because of
ego (ignorance) has sustained the world. Therefore bondage
and salvation are man (the self)-made. In Pure-Reality there
is neither bondage nor salvation but there is only God.* The
purpose of the use of the term ‘ca’ two times is that no
time is permanent. Neither the past nor the present nor the |
future ever stays but God ever exists. As the past and the -
future don’t persist now, so is the case with the present also.

The conjunction of the past and the future is called present.
There is a formula of Panini-grammar—‘vartamanasamipye -
vartamanavadva’ (3/3/131) viz., near-present is also like the
present. As the action which was performed in the past, is |
said in the present ‘I have come now’ and the action of the - |
future is also said in the present ‘I am going now’—this is
near-present which is called present. Had there been present -
really, it would have never changed into past. In fact time is
not present but only God is present. Therefore the Lord has
used the verb in the present tense ‘Vedaham’ (I know). God is
ever present in the past, at present and in future also, but in
God there is neither past nor future nor present. God’s present
existence does not depend on time because God transcends all
limits of time. Time has no existence either from the view-
point of God or from the view-point of an exalted soul. |

Comment:— | |
'Icchadvesasamutthena dvandvamohena bharata sarvabhitani

sammoharn sarge yanti parantapa'—Delusion, arises from desire -

and aversion, and it is because of this that beings, having

disinclination for God, follow the cycle of birth and death. _
Man, by having disinclination for the world, should be

engaged, in adoration of God. The main obstacle to this

engagement, is that a man, without attaching importance to

discrimination, performs actions being guided by attachment

and aversion, and thus, he degrades himself. A man, has two

contrary mental dispositions— inclination and disinclination. He,

has to be inclined towards God, and to be disinclined, from the

world i.e., he has to be devoted to God, and dispassionate, to

the world. But, when he applies both these dispositions to the

world, his devotion and dispassion, are respectively changed into

attachment and aversion, which cause him to be entangled in the

world and he has a total disinclination for God. Thus, because

of his attachment and aversion, to the pairs of opposites such as

pleasure and pain, etc., he cannot move towards spirituality, even

though sometimes he may attend religious discourses, study. the

scriptures and think over them. But, because of his attachment to

the world, he has a mind, that he has to make efforts to cause
"
972,"Verse 27] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 935
favourable circumstances, and to do away with, unfavourable
ones, as he cannot maintain his body, without these.

Out of these pairs of opposites, if he is particularly attached - 7
to one, viz., God or has even aversion to Him, or may also lead
him, to salvation. For example, Bilvamangala was attached only
to a prostitute, named Cintamani. He was scolded by her, that
if he had worshipped the Lord, with the devotion with which
he loved her mortal body, he would have attained salvation.

As a result, of her scolding, his attention was diverted to God,

and he attained salvation. Similarly, the attachment of Gopis for

Lord Krsna, led them to salvation. Sisupala's aversion to Lord -
Krsna got him salvation, while, Karhsa's fear of God gave him
salvation. Though Sisupala and Karhsa also, attained salvation,

yet they could not enjoy, the bliss of devotion. It means, that _
attachment or aversion, to God leads to salvation, while attachment

or aversion to the world, leads to degradation.

By the pairs of opposites, attachment for the world becomes 7

firm, because of desire for one, and aversion for the other.
Therefore, Lord Krsna, in the second chapter, orders Arjuna -
""Rise above the pairs of opposites"" (2/45). He also declares,
""He, who has transcended the pairs of opposites, is easily freed,
from bondage” (5/3). ""The undeluded devotee, freed from the
pairs of opposites, attain an imperishable supreme state"" (15/5).
In the thirty-fourth verse of the third chapter also, the Lord has
declared these, as man's main enemies (3/34). He also declares,
""The men of virtuous deeds, being freed from delusion, in the
shape of pairs of opposites, worship Me, with a firm resolve, in
everyway"" (7/28). Therefore, Lord Krsna, has laid great emphasis
on being free, from the pairs of opposites. _

Why do beings follow a cycle of birth and death? According
to scriptures, ignorance is the root of life and death. But according
to saints, it is the misuse of the circumstances, arising from
attachment. Performance of actions, with a desire for fruits, and
"
973,"936 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
misuse of circumstances i.e., performance of actions, against the
ordinance of scriptures, leads a man to his birth in good and evil
wombs through eighty-four lac forms of lives and hell. — -
- Right use of the available circumstances, does away with
delusion i.e., roots out the cycle of birth and death. How to
make right use of circumstances? We should have: a firm
determination, not to misuse these i.e:, not to act, against the
ordinance of scriptures and decorums. By having this determination,
circumstances will be used properly and rightly. By doing so,
we shall not be proud of our virtuous actions, because we are
determined, not to misuse the circumstances. Thus, we shall be
free, from pride of doership. By doing so, we shall not have
desire for the fruit of actions, because how can we have desire for
fruit, when we are not the doer? Thus being free from doership, -
and fruit of action, emancipation is axiomatic. -
Generally, strivers divide adoration and worldly affairs, in
watertight compartments. They attach importance to adoration -
and meditation etc., but they do not pay attention to attachment-
aversion, desire-anger etc., in their practical life. They are of an -
opinion that while performing action, attachment and aversion, are
natural, they cannot be wiped out. Because of this assumption,
of attachment and aversion, which are obstacles to their spiritual
progress, continue: So a striver, does not make quick spiritual
progress. He, while performing, either mundane or the spiritual
affairs, should be free from, attachment and aversion. —
A striver, should always keep the fact, in mind, ""I am a
striver and I have to realize God."" Thus, by having only the aim
of God-realization, both kinds of actions, mundane as well as
spiritual, will become, parts of his spiritual discipline.
Appendix—Though the root cause of worldly bondage is
ignorance, yet a man gets entangled in the world more by the
pairs of opposites—attachment and aversion, than by ignorance.
When a man regards any place, time, thing, person, circumstance
"
974,"Verse. 28] “SADHAKA-SANJIVANI - 937
etc., the cause of his pleasure and pain, then attachment and
aversion evolve. A man gets attached to the thing or. person
whom he thinks to be the cause of his pleasure and he has an -
aversion to the thing or person whom. he regards as the cause
of his. pain. When attachment and aversion are wiped out, a
man is easily liberated from the worldly bondage—‘nirdvando

The Lord in the thirteenth verse of this chapter has also
declared, “Deluded by these threefold modes (gunas) of Nature,
a being does not know Me.” Such deluded beings know neither
the world nor God. Being engrossed in the world, a man can’t -
know the world, and by keeping distance from the Lord, a
man can’t know the Lord. In fact a man knows the world by
getting detached (separate) from the world and he knows God _
by identifying himself with Him. The world has no existence—this
is the knowledge about the world. In fact the world which does :
not exist, which does not persist, what is the knowledge about ~
it? The world exists—this assumption 1s ignorance. ,

dvandvamohanirmukta bhajante mam drdhavratah'—The term
'Tu' (but), has been used to show the singularity. of those who,
being free from delusion, worship the Lord. Men of virtuous _
deeds, are those who have realized, that the only aim of human
life, is God-realization. They have a firm determination to realize
Him, during this human life, which has been bestowed upon
them for God-realization, and not for sensual pleasures. It means,
that determination is a better means, than oblation, charity and
penance etc., for purification, because this determination is of
one's own self, while actions such as oblation, charity etc., are
bodily acts. - a :
‘Antagatarh papam' means, that when a man has a firm
determination, that he has to realize God, all his sins are rooted
out, because disinclination for God, is the root of sins. The saints, -
have said that, there are one and a half sins, and one and a half
virtues. Disinclination for God is one sin, and to be engaged in
evil and immoral actions, is half. Similarly, inclination for God -
is one virtue, and engagement in good and moral actions, is half.
When a man surrenders himself to God, all his sins perish. 7
Secondly, those people whose sole aim is God-realization,
are virtuous because by having this aim, all their sins come to an
end. Even if, because of past influences, any sin, is committed,
God, Who dwells in their hearts, destroys that sin.
Thirdly, if a man determines sincerely, never to commit a
sin, in future, his sins, perish.
""Te dvandvamohanirmukta bhajante mam drdhavratah'—Men
of virtuous deeds, being. free from delusion of the pairs of
opposites, worship God, with a firm resolve. This duality (pairs
of opposites), can be of several kinds. :
1. Whether they should be engaged in divine adoration for
salvation, or in worldly affairs for welfare of this world...
2. Whether they should worship Lord Visnu, the preserver,
Lord Siva, the destroyer, Goddess Durga, God Ganeéa or the

Sun. Out of these five sects, which one should they follow?

- 3. Which of the following principles—dualistic, non- |
dualistic, special-non-dualistic, pure-non-dualistic etc., should _ |
they follow? 7 - |

4. Which of the Disciplines—of devotion, knowledge, action
and meditation etc., should they follow?

5. There are pairs of opposites like—favourable and
unfavourable circumstances, pleasure and pain, attachment and
aversion etc. | |

A man of virtuous deeds, being free from all spiritual and |
mundane dualistic delusions, worships God with a firm resolve. :

If a man has only the aim of God-realization, all pairs of
Opposites, come to an end, if he follows any spiritual discipline,
principle, sect or method. A striver, should follow any path, with -
exclusive devotion and without criticizing other paths. He should
respect the followers of other paths, without regarding them as
inferior to him, and without considering their sect inferior to his. ~
So long as, a striver disregards, others’ principles, religions and
sects etc., he cannot realize God. Therefore, a striver on paying -
due regard to all sects, principles and methods, should follow
his own path, with full faith and undivided devotion. By doing
so, his dualism comes to an end.

Tt is human nature, that when a man lives in spiritual
environment, he thinks that salvation, is a great achievement of
life. But, when he lives in mundane environment, he attaches
greater importance to worldly affairs, and secondary importance
to, adoration for God, because he thinks that he has to perform
action in order to get the necessities of life, and there is not
much use for adoration.

Those whose only aim is salvation, without caring for |
worldly pleasure and pain, profit and loss, fame and defame, __
regard and disregard etc., are free from delusion, of the pairs
of opposites. |
"
977,"940 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
‘Drdhavratah’ means, that the striver has a firm resolve to

worship God, whether he is dualistic or non-dualistic, endowed

with form or formless, two-armed or four-armed. He is not much

concerned, about different forms etc.* a -
When a striver, follows spiritual discipline he is confronted

with three questions: What is God like? What is the nature of

soul? What is the nature of the world? The answer, ts, 'God

exists’. He is not much concerned, about where He lives and

what He does etc. Similarly, about the soul it is enough for him,

‘I am', and about the world it is enough, to know that it is to be

renounced. It means, that a striver, by depending on God and |

having disinclination for the world, which is to be renounced,

has a firm resolve to attain Him. By having a firm resolve, he

becomes free from the delusion, of the pairs of opposites. The

gist of all the philosophies, is to have an inclination for God, -

by having disinclination for the world.

- Secondly, a striver has no knowledge about God, Who -
is attributeless and neither has he beheld God endowed with
attributes. But he knows, that the world is perishing every moment, oo
and assumes, that in the world, there is nothing besides God.

By having this knowledge and assumption, he worships God
with a firm resolve. Just like a chaste wife who is faithful to
her husband, a man of virtuous deeds, by depending on .God,
worships Him. | .

It is mentioned in the scriptures, including the Gita, and
also in the utterances of saints, the sinners, have no inclination
for God. This is a general rule. But sins cannot force a man
to have disinclination for God, because he is a fragment of
running death-snake, takes refuge in Him, and being afraid of Whom even
death is running, I take refuge in Him (Srimadbhi. 8/2/33). |
"
978,"Verse 28] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 941
God. Therefore, his purity may be veiled by sins, but cannot
be destroyed. Therefore, even the vilest sinner, who worships
Him with exclusive devotion, becomes virtuous (Gita 9/31).* 7 |
Therefore, a man should never think, that his sins are obstacles
to his adoration. Sins produce, unfavourable circumstances and
then perish. If sins, had been obstacles to adoration, Lord Krsna,
would not have declared, ""Even the vilest sinner, worships Me
with exclusive devotion (Gita 9/30). It means,-that sins, are not
obstacles to worship, the Lord. The sins of those who worship the
Lord, with a firm resolve, surrendering themselves to Him, come
to an end. So circumstances cannot be obstacles to adoration. ~
_ Men, having a desire for fruit of their virtuous actions, go
to heaven, while the evil actions lead men to hell. But, God
by His special grace, bestows the human body in between i.e., -
without forcing them to acquire the fruit of their actions. We
have got this human life, for God-realization, so we should never ,
be disappointed, as far as God-realization, is concerned. -
This human life, is not meant for sensual pleasures. It is
generally called a life for action. But, according to the principles -
and utterances of the saints, the only aim of this human life,
is God-realization. Both the favourable and the unfavourable
circumstances, are the means for God-realization. A striver, in | :
favourable circumstances, should serve others, and in unfavourable
circumstances, he should give up desire for favourable
circumstances. By doing so, both types of circumstances, will
become means for spiritual progress. In favourable circumstances,
old virtues perish and there are also chances to be entangled, in
sensual pleasures. But in unfavourable circumstances, old sins
* In other lives besides the human life this is not a rule that the nature may
be purified. By reaping the fnuit of sinful actions in eighty-four lac forms of lives
and in hells, sins are wiped out but nature does not improve. But in human life in
spite of having sins a striver's nature can be purified. Sins result in unfavourable
circumstances such as disease etc., while good company, spirituality and change
of doership change a striver's nature. .

perish, and a man becomes more alert, and careful in. spiritual
discipline. Therefore, saints value unfavourable circumstances,
more than favourable ones. = ;
Appendix—The greatest virtue is to turn one’s face towards
God because this is the root of all virtues.* But to turn away
one’s face from God is the most deadly sin, because this is the
| root of all sins. But the men whose sins have been destroyed
viz., who having a disinclination for the world, have inclined to
God, they being free from the duality of attachment and aversion,
pleasure and pain, joys and sorrows etc., worship God. This |
types of the devotees, who worship God, have been described in |
the sixteenth verse of this chapter by the expression ‘caturvidha
bhajante mam’. | -
_ Attachment and aversion go on attracting a man towards
. the world. So long as a man is attached to one thing, he has
an aversion to the other thing, because if a man is inclined -
to a thing, he will certainly have a disinclination for the other
thing. As long as a man has attachment and aversion, he can’t =__
be totally inclined to God, because he remains connected with
the world. The extent to which he is attached to the world, to
the same extent he remains detached from God viz., he has a
disinclination for God. | |
_ ‘Drdhavratah’—A man of lax nature can’t renounce the unreal
quickly. He has an idea and gives it up; then again he has another
idea and also relinquishes it—thus by having different ideas and
_ by giving them up, he inculcates this sort of bad habit. Because
of this bad habit he has the bookish knowledge (rot learning)
of renunciation of the unreal, but he finds himself helpless in
renouncing it. Even if he renounces the unreal once; because of

his lax nature he again assumes the existence of the unreal. This
Jax nature of a striver is self-made. Therefore it is inevitable
for a striver to have a firm resolve. Whatever plan is formed in -
the mind, he should stick to it. If he has a firm resolve even in
petty matters, by the formation of this type of nature, he will
acquire strength to renounce the unreal and to have disinclination
for the world. _ . | :

Comment:—
'Jaramaranamoksaya mamiéritya yatanti ye'—Here, deliverance
from old age and death, does not mean that after knowing Brahma,
the individual self and entire field of action, man will not suffer
from old age and will not die. But it means, that old age and
death will not be able to make him, sad. As in the thirty-fourth
* In the twenty-ninth and thirtieth verses in the phrase 'Mamasritya' (having

(practising Yoga); and in ""Yuktacetasah' (steadfast in mind), ""Mayyasaktamanah'
(with mind clinging) have been concluded. Similarly the term 'Samagram’ has been
used for Brahma, Adhyatma, Karma, Adhibhiita, Adhidaiva and Adhiyajfia.

verse of the thirteenth chapter, in 'Bhita. prakrti moksam' the
Lord says, that a striver realizes, that he is different from. nature
and its evolutes while here He means that a striver realizes, that 7:
he is different from the body and thus old age and death, have
no effectonhim. .  - re
_ A young man, is free from old age and death, only at present,
but it does not mean that he has deliverance from these forever,
while liberated souls are always free from these, because they
have separated themselves from their bodies, which suffer from
old age and death. When a man identifies himself with the body, -
he accepts the body's, old age and death, as his own. This is SO,
because he has.assumed ""I am the body and the body is mine.""
So in the eighth verse of the thirteenth chapter, Lord Krsna -
exhorts Arjuna to perceive, pain and evil in birth, death, old age
and disease. It means, that.a striver should not accept his affinity ,
of ‘T'ness. and ‘mineness', with this body. When the affinity is —
renounced, he is delivered from old age and death, because his
attachment for the body, is the cause of his birth, in good and 7
evil bodies (Gita 13/21). In fact, he is separate from the. body,
because the body decays and dies, while he lives ever. _ oe
In the phrase 'Mamasritya yatanti ye’, there are two aspects—to
take refuge in Him, and to strive. If a man strives, he may feel
proud of his achievement, as a result of striving. But, if he takes
refuge in Him, he may become idle. and lazy, and be engaged,
in prosperity and pleasure. Therefore, a striver, should strive
promptly, according to the ordinance of scriptures and give
credit, for success to God. |
So long as, a man attaches importance to the body, and the
world, regarding these as permanent, he, in spite of striving, does
not, realize God. Therefore, he should not attach importance to
them. He should strive to remove, these two stumbling blocks
"
982,"Verse 29] ~ SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI — 945
(i.e.,) attaching importance to the body and the world, and
accepting: their independent existence. But, those who taking
refuge in God, strive, are superior, because they feel that they ~
are engaged in spiritual discipline, only by God's grace. Thus,
by taking refuge in Him and having no pride, they realize the
full form, of the Lord. - | — : | 7

- Those who strive, without taking refuge in Him for salvation,
also know Him but they do not know, His entire form. As a
man practises ‘Pranayama’ (the process of restraining breath), he
achieves accomplishments (Siddhi), and if he rises above these, -
he knows formless God or gets established in his own self.
Similarly, the Bauddhas and Jains, who do not believe in God, _-
by following spiritual discipline according to their religion and | -
by renouncing their affinity for the world, attain salvation. But,
those who, having disinclination for the world, taking refuge in |
God, strive by knowing the Lord, in His entire form, receive 7
divine love. To express this singularity, Lord Krsna has used -
the expression 'Mamasritya yatanti ye’. : -

""Te brahma tat (viduh)'—Thus by striving, they attain Brahma

(the Infinite) who is formless, without attributes and who cannot
be perceived, by mind, intellect and -senses.

' God exists, in all beings, because He pervades everywhere,
every time, in all the things and men. But, He is not perceived,
because we have attached importance to the transitory and
Kaleidoscopic body, and world, and have accepted their independent
existence. So ever-attained God, seems to be unattained.

'Krtsnamadhyatmam (viduh)'—The strivers know the entire

individual self. In the tenth verse of the fifteenth chapter, Lord
Krsna says, ""The ignorant do not perceive the soul, departing
from one body and dwelling in the other, but those who possess
eyes of wisdom, perceive."" This perception, does not include
"
983,"946 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
knowledge of the number of beings, their activities and their
fate. But, they do know that the self, (soul) is different from the
body. Those who take refuge in Him, realize this reality. _

By taking refuge in God, when a striver breaks up his |
affinity for actions and things, he realizes, that his self, as well
as, the self of all the beings, is pure and detached from prakrti.
He comes to know, that he can never be identified, with actions
and. bodies, and he can never be separated, from his self. This
knowledge constitutes the fullest spiritual essence of the self.

_ ""Karma cakhilam viduh'—The strivers know the entire -

field of action i.c., why and how, the universe is created:
God has created, the bodies of the people according to a class
(caste) they belong to. But because of detachment, the Lord -
remains a non-doer and has no craving, for the fruit of action
(Gita 4/13-14). Similarly, 1f a man performs his duty and actions,
without feelings of doership, and without desire for the fruit of -
actions, he is not bound, by actions. Thus knowledge about the
entire field of action, is that a man-has no affinity. for action, -
he is completely detached, from these. a

The striver, who takes refuge in Him, with exclusive devotion,
does not depend on things and actions. He, very well realizes
that all things and actions, are kaleidoscopic and perishable. No
action or thing, even in Brahmaloka (the abode of Brahma), is
eternal, these are subject to, appearance and disappearance. So he
has, not the least affinity for actions. This is knowledge, about
the entire field of action. :

It means, that a striver by taking refuge in God knows
Brahma (the Infinite), the individual self and the entire field
of action i.e., he realizes, ""In the world there is nothing else,
besides God"" (7/7) and ""All this is God” (7/19). Thus, he comes
to know that Brahma, the individual self, and entire field of
"

Here 'Adhibhuta’, stands for matter, which has predominance -
of Tamas (the mode of ignorance). This matter has no independent

seems real, pleasant and attractive, because of God, Who is real,
pleasant and attractive. As ice has no existence without water,
matter is nothing, but manifestation of God. This is knowledge
about God and matter. : . ..
'Adhidaiva', is Brahma, the creator of the world. He has
predominance of 'rajoguna’ (the mode of passion). The Lord,
manifests Himself as Brahma also. This is true knowledge about
Adhidaiva and God.
_ ‘Adhiyajiia' is Lord Visnu, who pervades everywhere, in the
form of unmanifest Divinity. In Him, there is predominance of 7
the mode of goodness. This is true knowledge, about Adhiyajnia
and God. | ——
"
985,"948 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
Knowledge about God, with Adhibhuta, Adhidaiva and
Adhiyajiia is, that He stands holding the entire creation in one
limb, (Gita 10/42; 11/7) and in His supreme divine form, there -
are Adhibhita (Infinite universes), Adhidaiva (Brahma) and
Adhiyajiia (Visnu) etc. Arjuna also says, ""O God, I. behold
in Your body, all the gods and multitudes. of different beings,
Brahmi, the Lord perched on a lotus, Lord Siva and all the sages
and celestial serpents"" (Gita 11/15). Thus, in reality, Lord Krsna
is Adhibhita, Adhidaiva and Adhiyajiia.

(1) All evils, are born, by accepting our affinity for matter
and its evolutes—actions and things etc., and then those actions
and things seem, to have their independent existence. But, if we
by breaking up our affinity, for them get established in God,
their assumed independent existence, merges into God.

In the world, we assume a thing or a person, as good or
bad, but actually that thing or person, is nothing besides the
manifestation of God. As far as decorum of caste, and Aérama,
(religious orders of different periods, of life), is concerned,
we have to observe these in accordance with the ordinance

of scriptures and great souls, because these are guides for
attaining salvation. ,
There was existence of God, before this creation, and He
"
986,"Verse 30] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 949
will exist after its dissolution. When a striver realizes this reality,
about God, the universe merges into Him. It does not mean, that
the creation perishes, but it means, that the striver does not attach -
importance to the world, which is an obstacle to salvation. As, in
ornaments made of gold, there is nothing besides gold, a striver |
of steadfast mind realizes, that. in the world there is nothing
besides God. This fact has been explained, in the twenty-ninth
and thirtieth verses.
(2) For the worship of God He is described in two ways—one
with attributes and the second attributeless. The Lord, endowed _
with attributes is of two types—one endowed with attributes with
form and the other endowed with attributes but formless. The
attributeless Lord, is not of two types, He is only without attribute -
and formless. The formless Lord, is again of two kinds—one
endowed with attributes, but formless and the other, attributeless
and formless. -
Devotees are of two types—one who worship God with
attributes, and the other who worship God, without attributes. But =
both of them start their worship of the Lord, Who is endowed with
attributes, but is formless. He assumes, that.there is God, Who
is the Supreme Lord and He is the most merciful, and the best
one. Thus, though a devotee thinks of God, Who is attributeless
and formless, yet with his intellect, he thinks of God, Who is
endowed with attributes, and is formless.* The reason, is that
intellect being the evolute of prakrti (with attributes), cannot
have access, to attributeless God.
is formless. So He has been described in that way in the twenty-eighth verse. Then
in the twenty-ninth verse there is description of the Lord Who is attributeless and
formless and in the thirtieth verse of One who is endowed with form and attributes.
Thus each of them has been described in one verse. But in the eighth chapter each
of the three types has been described in three verses eighth to tenth, eleventh to
thirteenth and fourteenth to sixteenth respectively. .
"
987,"950 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
- Worshippers, first worship. God, Who is: endowed with
attributes and form. But so long: as,.His form is not fixed in
their minds, they assume, ""God exists and-He is ours."".The firmer
His form gets fixed, the higher their adoration. In the end, when
they are able to behold Him, talk to Him, touch Him and receive
blessing from Him, their worship attains perfection.. pO
Worshippers of attributeless God, think of Him, as One who
pervades, everywhere. The subtler their disposition grows, the
| higher their worship, is. In the end when their attachment and
egoism etc., are completely renounced, and no feeling of ‘T'ness
or 'You'ness, is left and only pure consciousness remains, their
worship attains, perfection.
Thus, both the devotees after attaining perfection, become one _
i.e., both of them attain the same Lord. The worshippers of the
Lord, endowed with attributes and form by His grace, also realize
the Lord, who 1s without attributes and form. If a striver, adoring -
attributeless and formless God, has some devotional influence,
and wants to behold Him, he can do so. If the Lord wants to -
make him an instrument, for His mission, He reveals Himself to
him, as He revealed Himself to Madhusidaniacarya.*
| (3) The Lord, is endowed with attributes and He is also
attributeless, according to the feelings of devotees. Similarly, He
is endowed with form and is also formless. Not only this, He
is also beyond the two. But this reality is known only, when a
devotee realizes Him. | |
The Lord, Who pervades everywhere with His divine traits,
such as beauty, love, glory, grace, etc., is called, God endowed
with attributes. He is of two kinds— | oo

"

(i) Endowed with attributes and formless—Just like the sky of
which attribute, is sound, but is formless, the Lord pervading the
entire universe, is endowed with attributes and is formless. -
- (ii) Endowed with attributes and form—When the Lord, Who
is with attributes and is formless; manifests Himself through His
own divine potency, keeping His nature (prakrti) under control,
and is perceived by senses is called, the Lord endowed, with
attributes and form.
When a striver assumes, that God does not possess divine
traits, He is called the Lord, without attributes and form. -
Attributes are also of two kinds (4) Uncommon divine traits,
such as beauty, love, glory and grace etc., (11) Three modes of
nature—sattva (mode of goodness), raja (mode of passion) and -
tama (mode of ignorance). God may, either be endowed with
attributes and be formless, or He may be endowed with attributes /
and form, He, is beyond the three modes of nature. He, by |
controlling His nature, plays the role of the Lord of creation,
preservation and destruction of the universe, and yet remains :
totally free from the modes of nature (Gita 7/13).
The Lord, Who is never bound by attributes, and has full
command over them, is called, the Lord without attributes.
Therefore, such a Lord, can be called endowed with attributes,
as well as attributeless, as also endowed, with form and also
formless. He has been described, in His entire form, in the
twenty-ninth and thirtieth verses.
In this chapter, Lord Krsna first explained His changeable
lower (insentient) nature, by ‘apara’' and unchangeable higher
(sentient) nature by ‘para’ (7/4-5). Then He explained, that He is
the origin and end of the whole universe. But, in the beginning
"
989,"952 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
and in the end, only He exists (7/6-7). Then He explained,
His comprehensiveness, by mentioning His seventeen divine
manifestations, in the form of cause (7/8—12). Afterwards, _
‘He explained, that he, who is under delusion of three modes

of nature i.e., who. has accepted his affinity for the changing
‘matter, cannot know Him, Who is beyond the modes of nature
(7/13). In the fourteenth verse, He explained that His wonderful _
illusion, is extremely difficult to surmount. In the fifteenth verse,

He explained, that evil doers do not seek refuge, in Him. In the
sixteenth verse, He explained four types of virtuous men, who
worship Him or take refuge in Him. Now a question arises, —
why Lord Krsna has inserted the fifteenth verse, which seems to

be out of context. The answer is, that had He not included the
fifteenth verse, it would have remained to be said, ""Evil-doers —~
do not seek refuge, in Me."" OO

There are two types of people, who take refuge in Him—first, _

those who regarding Him as God, take refuge in Him (7/16—19)
and the second, those who regard Him as a common man.

their increased desires, and their failure to realize the greatness

of God. Both of these, have been explained respectively, in
(7/20—23) and (7/24). In the twenty-fifth verse, He has explained,
that He is not manifest to those, who regard Him as an ordinary
person. The twenty-fifth verse, seems to express that He is also
veiled by divine potency. So, He has declared, in the twenty-
sixth verse, that His knowledge is not veiled. People do not
know Him, because of their attachment and aversion (7/27).
But those, who are freed from delusion in the shape of pairs of
Opposites, worship Him with a firm resolve (7/28). Those who,
taking refuge in Him, strive to know Him, in His entire form,

at last attain Him (7/29-30). | _
"
990,"Verse 30] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 953
If we delve deep into this chapter, we come to know, that
there is description of inclination and disinclination for God. ,
Those who have disinclination for God, and inclination for ~
matter, follow the cycle of birth and death. But if they have
inclination for God, they know the Lord who is endowed with
attributes and is formless, who 1s attributeless and formless
as also, who is endowed with attributes in entirety and —
attain Him.
Appendix—At the beginning of this chapter Lord Krsna said
to Arjuna, ‘‘I shall unfold to you this Jnana with Vijnana by ~ -
which you will know Me fully, having known which nothing
will remain to be known.” Then the Lord in the nineteenth
verse having said ‘vasudevah sarvam’ described His full form -
in brief. Now at the end of the chapter the Lord gives the details
of His full form. |
A striver has taken birth, and a disease (suffering) 1s not -
inevitable. Therefore here the expression ‘jaramaranamoksaya’
means that the devotees, who take refuge in God, are delivered -
from old age and death viz., they are not sad by thinking of
their old age and they are not sad by thinking of the end, they __
will meet after death. They, having taken shelter in God, strive;
therefore they know God in full with para prakrti and apara
prakrti viz., know Jnana with Vijnana. |
Though a Karmayogi and a Jiianayogi are also liberated from
birth and death but a devotee besides being liberated from birth
and death, knows God in His entire form. The reason is that a
Karmayogi and a Jiianayogi attain equanimity by practising the
discipline of action and the discipline of knowledge respectively
from the beginning, but a devotee depends on God from the
beginning. As he depends on God, the Lord by showering His
grace, enables him to know Him in full. | |
In the third verse of this chapter the Lord declared, “‘One
"
991,"954 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
who knows Me fully is rare—‘kaScinmar vetti tattvatah’. Here
He explains, “He who takes refuge in Me, knows Me in My
entire form.’ Therefore the main spiritual practice to know God _
in full (Jnana with Vijiiana) is—surrender in God (maméésritya). _
The reason is that God in full is not known by reflection but
He is known by His grace, when a devotee with faith and belief
takes shelter in Him. Therefore the Lord at.the beginning used
the term ‘madaSrayah’ and in the end concludes this chapter by
using the term, ‘mamasritya’.

‘Brahma’ (attributeless- formless), ‘krtsna adhyatma’ (endless
souls of endless births) and ‘akhila karma’(all the actions of -
origin-midstate-end etc.,}—this is the sphere of knowledge. In
this sphere there is predominance of nirguna (attributeless)
Brahma. ‘Adhibhuta’ (the entire universe consisting of five subtle _
elements including the body), ‘adhidaiva’ (all the deities such
as Brahma etc., with the presiding deities of mind-senses) and
adhiyajna (immanent Lord Visnu and all His forms)— this is_ -
the sphere of ‘vijiana’. In this division there is predominance
of Saguna (endowed with attributes) God. oe .

. God with ‘adhibhuta’, ‘adhidaiva’ and ‘adhiyajiia’ means that
the ‘Sat’, “Asat’, “‘para-apara’—all is God. There is nothing else
besides God. If the real and the unreal are distinguished, it is
the path of knowledge—‘nasato vidyate bhavo, nabhavo vidyate
satah. ubhayorapi....’ (Gita 2/16) and if they are unified, it is the
path of devotion—‘Sadasaccahamarjuna’ (Gita 9/19).

' . There is description of ‘Brahma’ from the thirteenth verse
to the twenty-sixth verse of the fifth chapter. ‘Krtsna adhyatma’
has been mentioned in the twenty-ninth verse of the sixth
chapter by the expression ‘Sarvabhiitasthamatmanam’. ‘Akhila
Karma’ has been described in the eighteenth, twenty-third
and thirty-third verses of the fourth chapter by the expression
‘krtsna karmakrt’, ‘karma samagram’ and ‘sarvarh karmakhilarh’
respectively. : |
"
992,"Verse 30] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 955
An action ends but the self and Brahma are never non-
existent. In junsprudence it is mentioned that the sense
which perceives the existence of a thing, the same sense -
perceives the non-existence and also the class of that thing.
Therefore the knowledge which enables a man to know actions
(karma cakhilam), with the same knowledge, he knows the
nothingness of actions viz., inaction—‘karmanyakarma yah
pasyet (Gita 4/18). Brahma (the Absolute), atma (the soul)
and akarma (inaction)—the three are only one; this knowledge
is the meaning of the expression—‘te brahma_ tadviduh
krtsnamadhyatmam karma cakhilam.’ :
An ‘action’ is limited, ‘adhyatma’ (self) is more extensive —
than ‘action’, ‘Brahma’ is more extensive than ‘adhyatma’. But
‘mam’ (God in full) is superior even to Brahma because within 7
‘Brahma’ ‘the entire form of God’ is not included but within
‘the entire form of God’ Brahma is included. | -
The purpose of using the term ‘krtsna’ with adhyatma’ 1s
the aggregate of individual self, seen in different forms whom /
the Lord has called His ‘para prakrti’. The Lord by giving the
word ‘akhila’ with ‘karma’ means—all the virtuous and sinful |
actions, whose fruit leads. the self to numerous wombs and
numerous worlds; but the term ‘krtsna’ or ‘akhila’ has not been
used with ‘Brahma’, it means that ‘Brahma’ is not numerous
but is only one. | 4
In the Gita the Lord has mentioned two-fold path to achieve
equanimity—Karmayoga and jnanayoga. The two paths are
worldly—‘loke’smindvividha nistha’ (Gita 3/3); but Bhaktiyoga
is ‘alaukika nistha’ (unworldly path). The reason is that in
Karmayoga there is predominance of ‘ksara’ (world) and in
Jnanayoga there is predominance of ‘aksara’ (soul). Ksara
and aksara—both are in the world—‘dvavimau purusau loke
ksarascaksara eva ca’ (Gita 15/16), therefore Karmayoga and
"
993,"956 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA (Chapter 7
Jnanayoga—both are worldly paths. But in Bhaktiyoga there in
predominance of God Who transcends the perishable (Ksara)
and is superior. to the imperishable (aksara) (Gita 15/17-18).  __
Therefore Bhaktiyoga is the unworldly path. In the entire form

of God, there is mention of Brahma, adhyatma and Karma—in
them there is mention of the worldly path (Karmayoga and
Jnanayoga)* and in ‘adhibhita, adhidaiva and adhiyajna
there is mention of the unworldly path (Bhaktiyoga). ‘Jnana
(knowledge) is worldly—‘na hi jianena sadrsarh pavitramihaT
vidyate’ (Gita 4/38) and Vijnana is unworldly. The worldly
and the unworldly—both are the manifestations of ‘Samagra’ _-
(full form of) God—‘Vasudevah Sarvam’.

In the term ‘loka’ both insentient and sentient are included.
The term ‘loka’ cannot denote either only insentient or only —
sentient. Therefore in ‘laukika’ both insentient and sentient
are included but in ‘alaukika’ only sentient is included because
‘alaukika’ is ever divine. But in ‘the entire form’ (Samagra), — :
‘laukika’ (worldly) and ‘alaukika’ (unworldly)—both are
included. | -

Here a point needs special attention that ‘Brahma’ Who
is attributeless and formless is within the entire form of God.
Generally people believe that within attributeless and formless
Brahma, there is God endowed with attributes. They hold that
Brahma is free from maya and God is not free from Maya. In
fact this assumption is neither in accordance with the ordinance

* The term ‘adhyatma’ should mean ‘Jianayoga; and ‘Karma’ should
mean ‘Karmayoga’. Brahma is attained by both Jiianayoga and Karmayoga
(Gita 5/4-5). |

Being the context of devotion, the Lord here has not described Jnanayoga
and Karmayoga in detail. They have already been described in detail from the
second to the sixth Chapter.

+ Here the term ‘iha’ used within ‘pavitramiha’ stands for ‘loka’
(world).
"
994,"Verse 30] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 957 |
of the scriptures nor is reasonable because when, in Brahma,
there is no illusion (maya) then how can God with ‘maya’
be within Brahma? How is there ‘maya’ in Brahma? But
in the Gita the Lord declares, ‘‘In a fragment of My entire -
form there is Brahma because I am the support of Brahma
‘brahmano hi pratisthaham’ (Gita 14/27) and this universe is
pervaded by Me in My unmanifest form ‘maya tatamidarh |
sarvamh jagadavyaktamirtina’ (9/4).’’ By these utterances the
Lord means to say, “‘I am not a fragment of Brahma but
Brahma is My fragment.’’ Therefore if we reflect upon it in
an impartial manner, it is-evident that in the Gita there is not -
predominance of Brahma but there is predominance of God.
The entire form of God is complete within which God with
attributes as well as attributeless; God with form and also
formless are included. -
- In fact the entire form can be of God endowed with
attributes only because within the word ‘saguna’ (God endowed -
with attributes), “‘nirguna’ (attributeless) (the Absolute) can be
included, but within the word ‘nirguna’, ‘saguna’ cannot be
included. The reason is that in “saguna’ there is no negation of
“‘nirguna’ but in ‘nirguna’ there is negation of “gunas’ (attributes).
Therefore in ‘nirguna the word ‘samagra’ (full or entire) cannot
be used. So here with ‘adhyatma’ and Karma’ the words
‘krtsna’ and ‘akhila’ have been used respectively but no such
word has been used with Brahma. Therefore there is entirety
(fullness) in God endowed with attributes rather than in
attributeless Brahma.

Question—How are Brahma, adhyatma and Karma all the
three ‘laukika (worldly)?

Answer—The Lord has called Brahma ‘aksara’ (imperishable)}—
‘aksaramn brahma paramam’ (Gita 8/3) and He has also called
the soul ‘aksara’—‘dvavimau purusau loke ksarascaksara eva
"
995,"958 ~ §RIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
ca’ (Gita 15/16). The soul and. Brahma—both are one—
‘ayamatma brahma’ (Mandikya 1). The soul which by having
connection with Prakrti (body) ‘is called ‘jiva’ (adhyatma)
(embodied soul),* the same by having no connection with -
Prakrti is Brahma’. Therefore according to the Gita as ‘jiva’ is in
the world, so is ‘Brahma’ in the world viz., Brahma is attained
by the worldly paths (Karmayoga and Jnianayoga). |
_ ‘*Adhyatma viz., the soul has sustained the world ‘yayedarh
dharyate jagat’ (Gita 7/5). The soul has no independent
existence of its own. Therefore the soul by being attached to
the world has become ‘jagat’ (worldly) (Gita 7/13). Being in .
the world the soul is also ‘laukika’ (worldly)—‘mamaivarhso
jivaloke’ (Gita 15/7), ‘dvavimau purusau loke ksarascaksara
eva ca’ (Gita 15/16). . _
Actions are performed in two ways with an interested
motive and in a disinterested manner. These two types of
actions being in the world are laukikaf. -
Question:—How are ‘adhibhuta’, ‘adhidatva’ and ‘adhtyajiia’—
these three unworldly? -
Answer:—‘adhibhita’ viz., the entire world consisting
of the five subtle elements, being the manifestation of God
is unworldly—‘amrtarh caiva mrtyusca sadasaccahamarjuna’
(Gita 9/19) ‘‘I am immortality as well as death; I am also being
* badhyo bisaya saneha te, tate kahiyai jiva |
alakha ajoni apa hai, hariya nydrau thiva |
t In the world, actions performed with an interested motive—
‘yajfiarthatkarmano’ nyatra loko’ yarh karmabandhanah’ (Gita 3/9); ‘ksipram hi
manuse loke siddhirbhavati karmaja’. (Gita 4/12); ‘Karmanubandhini manusyaloke’
(Gita 15/2). In the world actions performed in a disinterested manner ‘loke’ smin-
dvividha.....yoginam’ (Gita 3/3). .
In fact actions are neither ‘Sakima’ nor ‘Niskama’ but the doer is ‘Sakama’
or ‘Niskama.’ Therefore ‘sakama (interested motive) and ‘niskama’ (disinterested
manner) persist in the doer. ,
"
996,"Verse 30] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 959
and non-being, both*. The cosmic form which Lord Krsna revealed
to Arjuna was also divine or unworldlyf.
The Lord revealed His divine cosmic form in a. part -
of His divine body. Therefore the world consisting of five
subtle elements, being the cosmic form of God, is also
unworldly §. The Lord has also called His ‘vibhitis’ (divine
glories) as divine viz., unworldly—‘divya hyatmavibhutayah’ :
* manasa vacasa ‘drstya erhyate’ nyairapindriyaih
- ahameva na matto’nyaditi budhyadhva majfijasa
| (Srimadbha. 11/13/24)
. Whatever is perceived (received) with the mind, with tongue, with -
eyes and with other senses, all that is only ‘I’. Therefore there is nothing
else besides Me—understand and accept this principle quickly after reflecting
upon it.

(Gita 10/19), ‘mama divyanarn vibhitinam’ (10/40)* But a
person (embodied soul) out of ignorance with his intellect
(because of attachment-aversion) perceives this ‘jagata’ (world)  -
as ‘laukika’ (mundane) (matter). Therefore when ignorance

is wiped out, inertness (matter) does not persist, only
divinity remains. , 7

‘adhidaiva’ viz., Brahma etc., all the deities are unworldly,
‘adhiyajnia’ viz., indwelling God in spite of lodging in the
hearts of all, because of remaining untainted, is unworldlyt.

In the expression ‘Sadhibhuatadhidaivarn marh Sadhiyajiiath’
the Lord mentions, ‘‘He who knows Me with adhibhita, :
adhidaiva and adhiyajia,’’ it proves that as these three are
with God so they are unworldly, otherwise they are worldly.

| So long as there is no connection with God, all is worldly; -
when there is connection with God, all becomes unworldly.
Therefore Karmayoga and Jnanayoga are ‘worldly paths’ as
in them a striver’s effort is important while ‘Bhaktiyoga’ is -
the unworldly path as in it there is predominance of refuge
in God. | -

In fact there is no entity which is worldly. The real entity
is only unworldly. But from the view-point of a striver the
discrimination between the worldly and the unworldly has
been mentioned. It means that this distinction between the
worldly and the unworldly persists out of ignorance because
of attachment and aversion. If attachment and aversion are

* Arjuna has also called ‘vibhitis’ (glories) as divine—‘vaktumarhasya-

Two birds—soul and God who keep company with each other and are
friendly with each other, live by taking refuge in the same tree—body. One of
them the soul (embodied soul) tasting the fruit of actions of that tree relishes
(enjoys) them but the other (God) without relishing them only illumines them.

998,"Verse 30] _SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 961
renounced, all is unworldly, spiritual and divine—‘vasudevah
sarvam’. The reason is that the mundane has no independent :
existence. It is because of attachment and aversion that the
mundane seems to. exist and is. valued. It is because of -
attachment and aversion that a man (the self) has made the
world, which is the manifestation of God, mundane and he
himself has also become mundane.
_ The purpose of describing knowledge with ‘Vijiana’ viz.,

the entire form of God is that non-self-self, the real-unreal,
para-apara (higher and lower nature), ksetra (it is constituted of
24 elements)—ksetrajiia (soul)—whatever persists is only God’s .
manifestation. Therefore. the Lord here at the beginning and
at the end of the description of His entire form has used the
term ‘mam’ (Me) which denotes His entire form—‘mamasritya’ _
(7/29) and ‘math te viduh’ (7/30). |

The Lord has declared that the nature of actions is
mysterious—‘gahana karmano gatih’ (Gita 4/17), but a devotee -
knows it also. Inaction in action and action in inaction (4/18)—a
devotee knows these two also. It means that he knows actions ~
and also the Discipline of Action (Karmayoga). A Karmayogi
knows only Karmayoga; a Jnanayogi knows only Jnanayoga;
but a devotee by God’s grace knows both—Karmayoga and
Jnanayoga. | | .

The idea expressed in the first verse of this chapter by the
expression “yogam yunjanmadasrayah’ has been expressed here
by the expression ‘maméaéritya yatanti ye’; and the idea expressed )
by the expression ‘mayyasaktamanah’ has been expressed here by
the expression ‘yuktacetasah’. It means, ‘“The devotee who takes
shelter in Me attains the aim which is attained by Karmayoga
and Jiianayoga viz., they know Brahma Who is the fruit (aim)
of these two disciplines—‘te brahma tadviduh’ and they also
know God in full—‘marh te viduh’, |
"
999,"962 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter7
_ In the expression ‘prayanakale’pi’ the term ‘api’ means that
those devotees know God before the hour of death and also
at the hour of death viz., their knowledge never disappears. _
Such devotees become ‘yuktaceta (steadfast in mind) viz., |
their mind has no independent existence, it gets identified
with God, only God remains. Being one (having eternal
union) with God, they are neither separated from God nor |
- is God separated from them. Such devotees at the time of
death, even if some thought comes to their mind, they don’t
meet the fate of “‘yogabhrasta’ (he who deviates from yoga)
but attain God—‘prayanakale’ pi ca marh te viduryuktacetasah’.
The reason is that from the view-point of those devotees,
there is nothing else besides God, then where will their
mind wander besides God? Why will it wander? How will it -
wander? If he thinks of anything, he will think of God only,
then how will his mind deviate and without deviation of the
mind, how will he fall from yoga? The reason is that in the -
discipline dependant on instruments (Karana sapeksa), when
the mind deviates from Yoga, then there is fall from Yoga— -
‘yogaccalitamanasah’ (Gita 6/37) but he, who beholds God |
everywhere, has his eternal union with God.
Some devotees want only emancipation (Salvation)—
~  ‘jaramaranamoksaya’ and some devotees want love (devotion)}—
‘mam te viduryuktacetasah’. The devotees who. want salvation,
they know Karmayoga and Jiianayoga (brahma, adhyatma and
Karma) but the devotees who want love, they themselves,
know God in full—‘mam viduh’. God confers his devout
devotees with Karmayoga (buddhiyoga) and J fianayoga—both
(Gita 10/10-11). Bondage in the form of old age and death;
and also salvation—both are worldly but love (devotion) is
unworldly. Though devotion as spiritual-discipline is worldly
but the aim being unworldly, that devotion is included in

pursuit of mind, of the Lord (viz., the renunciation); that is the
immediate cause of man, having come into existence, is called
‘Karma’. : | -
At the time of final annihilation, prakrti (primordial matter or
nature), is supposed to be inactive, while at the time of creation,
prakrti is supposed to be active. The cause of this activity, is _
the Lord's pursuit of mind to become manifold, from one. This
pursuit of mind, is the cause of the creation. At the time, of final
annihilation, beings with egoism and collected actions, merge into -
nature and then nature, including beings, merges into God. To
activate, the merged nature, from the Lord's pursuit of mind, there 7
is discharge or renunciation, which is the cause of man, having
come into existence, and with it the chain of actions begins.
Lord Krsna, in the fourteenth chapter, declares, ""My prakrti
(nature) is the womb of all creatures; in which, I place the seed
(germ) (14/3-4). Here, ‘placing the seed’ means, that the Lord
links the souls with the bodies, according to fruit of actions, 7
of their previous births. The bodies, are born of nature and in
the bodies, the soul is a fragment of God (Gita 15/7). Thus, all
beings are born, by the union of nature and God. :
‘In the twenty-sixth verse of the thirteenth chapter, the
Lord declares, ""Whatever being animate or inanimate, is born,
know that, as emanated from the union of 'Ksetra’ (Matter) and
'Ksetrajiia’ (Spirit or Soul)"". The Lord's pursuit of mind, is the
cause of this union. In that pursuit, there is no pride, of the Lord.
"
1005,"* 968 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 8
He. has pursuit of mind, when past influences of actions of the
previous births of beings at the time of final annihilation, get
matured to bear fruit.* In this way, the actions of beings inspire -
the Lord, to have a pursuit of mind to change Himself, into
manifold forms, from one. All actions performed by persons of
different 'Varnas' (castes), are called 'Karma’. It. means, that an
important act, is the Lord's pursuit of mind, and then the chain
of actions begins. a
Appendix—‘Svabhavo’dhyatmamucyate’—‘para prakrti’ is
God’s nature—‘prakrtimn viddhi me param’ (Gita 7/5). Either call
it ‘prakrti’ or call it ‘Svabhava’ (nature)—-both are the same. This .
‘para prakrti’ viz., ‘the embodied soul’ has been mentioned as
‘adhyatma’. The Lord has called it His fragment—‘mamaivarnso
jivaloke’ (Gita 15/7). ne -
‘Svabhavo’ dhyatmamucyate’— The second meaning of this
expression is that in boyhood, youth and old age; in wakefulness,
sleep and sound sleep; in eighty-four lac forms of life; in creation -
and dissolution; in new creation and final dissolution, the soul
never ceases to be—‘nabhavo vidyate satah’ (Gita 2/16) viz., .
the existence of the soul ever persists. |
The action of the creation of the universe has been called
‘tyaga’ (renunciation), it means that in it there is renunciation
of the constancy of divinity. The reason is that divinity is fixed
and constant and renunciation of that constancy is Karma.’
The Lord’s action of the creation of the universe is the earliest
~ action* from which the tradition of actions followed. Therefore
' * Beings while worki ng continuously get tired and sleep in spite of having
their pride of doership, attachment for the fruit of actions and collected actions.
After sleep their tiredness is removed and their bodies, senses, minds and intellects
are refreshed and they regain energy to work. Similarly, beings with the pride
of doership, attachment for the fruit of actions and collected actions merge into
Nature: The accumulated actions of those beings with the passage of time by
becoming mature bear fruit. There the Lord has His pursuit of mind to give them
birth according to their actions. His pursuit is called ‘Action’.
"
1006,"Verse 4] -SADHAKA-SANJIVANI | 969

within the term ‘karma’ (action), three types of actions are included

(i) Creation of the universe, (ii) mere ‘kriya’ which does not

bear any fruit, (iii) virtuous and sinful actions which bear fruit. _

~The Lord’s action of the creation of the universe is indeed

‘akarma’ (inaction). The Lord has also declared “tasya kartaramapi

mam viddhyakartaramavyayam” (Gita 4/13)—‘though I am the

creator of the universe, yet know Me, the immortal Lord, to be

a non-doer.’ |

for Brahma. At the beginning of the creation by God's pursuit

of mind, there is revelation of Brahma, the creator of the world,

and then he creates the universe. — :

same again, ""I am specially seated, in the hearts of all” (13/17),
""I am installed, in the hearts of all"" (15/15), ""The Lord dwells,
in the hearts of all beings"" (18/61). | -
‘Ahameva atra* dehe’ means, that in other bodies, beings reap
the fruit of their previous actions and are not free to perform
new actions; while in a human body new actions are performed,
due to Lord's inspiration.t The actions which are performed by
the Lord's inspiration, being free from attachment and aversion,
are pure and they do not lead a man to bondage, while actions
performed with attachment and aversion, lead to bondage,
because these are not performed due to Lord's inspiration. The -
reason is, that attachment and aversion, are verily man's enemies
(Gita 3/34). It means, that forbidden actions can never be
performed, with God's inspiration. The scriptures and jurisprudence, _
contain the inspiration (Command) of the Lord. Forbidden
actions, are performed under the sway of desire (Gita 3/37).
If a man is not a victim of desire, he will perform actions, —
which are sanctioned by scriptures and which, have been called,
actions ordained by one’s own nature or innate actions, in the
eighteenth chapter. | | |
By using 'Dehabhrtam vara’, for Arjuna, Lord Krsna, wants
to convey that the man who knows that the Lord is installed
in the body, is the best. Even if he does not know, he should
assume that in each atom of physical, subtle and causal bodies,
the Lord pervades and the aim of human life is, to realize Him. ,
and they can't attain God-realization, though the Lord also dwells in their bodies.
So a human being by utilizing this life should realize God in this very birth.
* In the second verse the term 'Atra’ (Here) has been used for the context and
the term 'Asmin’ (This) for the body but here the term 'Atra' has been used for the
body, because while putting the question. Arjuna has given a hint of the context,
therefore there is no need for using the term ‘Atra' in the answer.
{ The Lord gives inspiration to human beings according to their nature. A
man is free to be or not to be under the sway of attachment and aversion. He by
depending on the scriptures, saints and the Lord can change his nature.
"
1008,"Verse 4] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 971
To attain that aim, he should carry out ‘the command of the Lord,
by performing action. | |
The terms ‘Brahma’, ‘Adhyatma’, ‘Karma’, ‘Adhibhuta’,
‘Adhidaiva’ and 'Adhiyajiia’, can be explained, by giving an :
illustration of water. When the sky is clear, we feel that there is |
nothing between us and the sun, yet there are atoms (molecules) :
of water. Water is transformed into clouds, by evaporation. Clouds
turn to drops of rain. Those drops, at a low temperature, are frozen
into snow. Similarly, the attributeless and formless Brahma (the
Absolute), is like molecules of water, Adhiyajiia (All-pervading
Lord Visnu) is water, as vapour, Adhidaiva (Brahma) is, water
as cloud, Adhyatma (Infinite embodied soul), is water as drops
of rain, Karma (creation of the universe), is the activity of rain
and Adhibhita (perishable world), is water as snow. |
It means, that as water takes different forms, the Lord also -
transforms Himself, into different forms. This knowledge about
Him is complete (7/1) and so a man of aspiration realizes that, 7
all this is God (7/19). |
Though in essence, there is nothing besides the Lord, yet _ ;
by discrimination, we see its two separate parts, a body and the
soul. A devotee, perceives the Lord, (the Adored), the devotee
(soul), and matter (the world). These three parts have been
divided into six. a :
The Lord—Brahma (attributeless), and Adhiyajiia (endowed
with attributes). 7
The soul of two kinds—adhyatma (embodied soul which is
bound) and Adhidaiva (Karaka Purusa, a liberated soul). :
The world has two separate forms—actions (heaps of change)
and Adhibhuta (matter).
1. Brahma —_ < 6. Adhiyajiia
2. Adhyatma —> <- 5. Adhidaiva
3. Karma (Action) —> < 4. Adhibhiita
"
1009,"972 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 8
(1) In the Gita, Lord Krsna has declared His existence in
different ways, ""All this is permeated by Me"" (9/4); ""By whom -
all this is pervaded"" (18/46); ""There is nothing else, besides
Me"" (7/7); ""All this is God"" (7/19); ""I am the enjoyer. and the
Lord of all sacrifices"" (9/24); ""I am the enjoyer of sacrifices and |
austerities, the Supreme Lord of all the worlds” (5/29). Now let
us think how to bring these into harmony.
All the strivers* in the world, want to attain God, by being
free from the bondage of the world, because they want to attain a :
state of eternal peace and bliss. The worldly people, having affinity
for the world, always suffer from disquietude and sorrow. The
Lord, is the abode of infinite bliss, this is mentioned in scriptures
and discourses of the saints who have also realized it. -
Now, a question arises, that the world is clearly visible,
while a striver has to assume the existence of God, Who -
is invisible. The striver starts adoration, -by believing in the
scriptures and the saints, as they declare, ""The Lord pervades -
the entire universe."" So long as, he attaches primary importance
to the world, the Lord gets, a secondary place. But, by and
by, when by constant devotion, his belief gets a firm footing,
about the existence of God, a striver visualizes, that the world
is perishing continuously. Finally, he perceives, that the world
merely seems to appear, but has ever been non-existent, and
the Lord existed in the past, exists now, and will exist in
future, because He is eternal and in the world there is nothing
besides Him. When a striver realizes ""All is God"", he becomes
a ‘Siddha’ (perfect soul). |
bliss, totally free from turmoil and sorrows. But the worldly people are those
who hanker after worldly prosperity and pleasures and thus follow the cycle
of birth and death. :
"
1010,"Verse 4] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 973 :
(2) The Lord, is being and non-being, both (9/19); He is said
to be, neither being nor non-being (13/12); He is being and the
non-being, and also beyond the two (11/37). How to harmonize .
the different statements?
In fact, the Lord is very uncommon and unique. He cannot
be perceived by senses, mind and intellect, which can merge into |
Him. The striver himself, can also merge into Him and attain :
Him, but cannot control Him. |
There are two kinds of strivers—those having predominance
of discrimination (mind), and those having predominance of faith,
(devotion) (heart). But, it does not mean, that the former has 7
no faith at all, and the latter, no discrimination at all. In the
former, there is predominance of discrimination, while faith is
secondary. In the latter, there is predominance of faith, while _
discrimination is secondary. In other words, it can be said, that
the former first knows and then assumes, while the latter, first
assumes and then knows. | -
A striver, whether he follows the path of discrimination or
that of faith, can attain his aim quickly if he has taste for faith on -
(belief) and capability of his discipline. Because of interest, the
mind is naturally motivated; because of faith (belief), intellect is
naturally motivated, and because of capability, truth is understood.
Strivers having predominance of discrimination, adore the Lord,
Who is attributeless and formless, while the latter ones, adore the
Lord, endowed with attributes and form. The former, says that He
is neither being nor non-being, while the latter believes that He is
the being, the non-being and also, beyond the two.
Thus we conclude that the Lord (Pure-consciousness)
always remains the same, while the perishable world, changes
continuously. When a man attaches importance to the perishable
world, by having affinity for it, he has to follow, the cycle of
birth and death. But, when he breaks up his affinity for the
world, he realizes God. A striver having predominance of
"
1011,"974 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 8
discrimination, breaks off affinity for.the world (matter), by
applying his discrimination and then Pure-Consciousness remains,
while a devotee having faith in Him, by having disinclination for
the world, attains Him through devotion. The former, by being -
established in the Absolute, Who is All-Truth, All-Consciousness
and All-Bliss, attains indestructible and infinite bliss, while the
latter by becoming one. with Him, attains infinite and ever- |
enhancing bliss of love. : | | 7
Thus, both the strivers by renouncing their affinity for the
world, attain pure-consciousness, and realize that the Lord, is
being and non-being both. | :
| Appendix—All actions and objects which are kaleidoscopic
and perishable are—‘ksara bhava’ which is the Lord’s apara
prakrti. | | | a
In knowledge there is union of the self with Brahma and in love
there is intimate union (abhinnata) of a devotee with the indwelling
Lord. The Lord has declared here ‘the indwelling’ (adhiyajiia) as -
His own Self. Therefore ‘Brahma’ is adjective and ‘antaryami’
(indwelling) is the noun qualified—‘brahmano hi pratisthaham’ :
(Gita 14/27). It means that the creator and controller of all beings
Who has been mentioned as ‘Samagra’ (entire) in the Gita, is
the indwelling Lord Himself. The same ‘indwelling’ has been
mentioned by the term ‘aham’ in the third and fourth verses of the
fourteenth chapter in the expression—‘mama yonirmahadbrahma
tasmingarbharn dadhamyaham’ and ‘aharh bijapradah pita’. In
the Gita it is mentioned for Brahma ‘na Sattannasaducyate’(13/
12) and for entire God it is mentioned—‘sadasaccaham’ (9/19),
‘sadasattatparam yat’ (11/37).

Comment:— |

‘Antakale ca mameva smaranmuktva kalevaram yah prayati |
sa madbhavam yati nastyatra samSayah'—It means, that the -
Lord by bestowing this human body upon man, gave him an
opportunity to attain salvation, through adoration. But, he did
not avail himself of the opportunity. Now, being helpless, the _
only way open to him is to realize Him, by remembering Him
at least while breathing his last. | :

‘Mameva smaran' means, that whatever a striver hears, 7
sees, understands and assumes, is nothing besides the Lord. By
assuming sO, whatever a striver thinks, at the time of death is -
nothing else, besides the Lord. Thus if a striver thinks of Him,
at the time of death, he will attain Him.

""Madbhavam' means, that the striver attains the state of
Godhood whether he is a dualist or a non-dualist—this is in
accordance with the remembrance, at the last moment. That God
may be endowed with attributes or attributeless, endowed with
form or formless, two-armed or four-armed etc., according to
one's worship.

Worshippers of the Lord, attain Him by thinking of Him,
at the time of death. But even to the minds of those who do
not worship Him, if somehow or the other, His thought comes,
they also attain Him. As a person, remains established in a mode
of nature (14/18), and as he dies during the predominance of
Nature-born qualities, (Modes) of sattva (goodness) or raja

_ (passion) or tama, (ignorance), he gains the same kind of world
(Gita 14/14-15), a devotee who at the time of death, remembers
God, attains Him. At the end, devotees following ° different _
disciplines of worship become one, i.e., attain the. same Lord,
while persons having predominance of anyone of the three
Nature-born modes, gain. worlds according to the mode they
possess viz., and follow. a cycle of birth and death  =—
It is a special favour granted by the Lord, that a man at
the time of death, by remembering Him, will attain Him, even
though his conduct and life had been vicious, as the only aim of
this human life, is God-realization. Otherwise, it is not befitting .
to the Lord Who has bestowed this human life and also to a
person who has received it. Therefore, it is a warning to every
person, that he should be careful to remember Him, all the _
time, because anytime, can be the time of death, as it keeps no
calendar. In Ethics, it is mentioned that if a man wants to follow
righteousness, and attain salvation, he should always remember -
that, he is in the grip of death. : 7
A man, should utilize the special concession, granted to him, -
by God. If there is a person on the death-bed, he should be shown
a picture of his favourite Deity, the name of his Deity should
be chanted, and he should be reminded of his Deity's form. A
spiritual atmosphere should be created, so that messengers of the
god of death, may not approach him. Ajamila, recited the name
of the Lord ‘Narayana’, and so messengers of God approached
while the messengers of death, fled away. Then the god of death
said to his messengers, ""Where there is constant remembrance,
loud chanting or narration of the stories of the Lord, never go
there, because that place is out of our domain."" By saying so,
the god of death in thinking of God, tendered an apology to Him
in these words, ""O Lord, pardon my messengers for the offence,
they have committed"" (Srimadbha. 6/3/30).
""He thinks of Him, at the time of death’. It means, that he may
"
1014,"Verse 5} . SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 977
remember anyone of His forms, as that of Rama, Krsna, Visnu,
Siva, Durga, Ganega or His name, place, qualities or sport. By
thinking of Him,:a.person attains Him, because by remembering -
God he forgets ""I am, the body and the body, is mine.""

‘A doubt arises here, as to how a man, who has not worshipped
the Lord, throughout his life, can remember Him, at the time of
his death. The answer is, that either by God's special grace, or
by seeing a saint or by listening to the name, play, stories of
the Lord or scriptures, he may think of God and thus may attain
Him. If he is interested in the Gita, and he is on a death-bed, the |
eighth chapter should be recited to him, so that he may think of
God at that time, as there is a special description, of the glory
about thinking of Him, at the time of death. The reason, is that
being a fragment of the Lord, his affinity for Him is natural. -
Similarly, if he dies at a place of pilgrimage, such as Ayodhya, :
Mathura, Haridvara, Kai etc., he will remember the Lord,
because of the spiritual influence of that place of pilgrimage. -
He can also think of God, at the last moment, at a place, where
a spiritual atmosphere of constant remembrance, loud chanting -
and stories of the Lord, prevails and where spiritual discourses
are held. Some terrifying situation, could also remind, the man
of God. If at the time of death, he. somehow or the other, takes
refuge in Him, he attains Him. If, all of a sudden he thinks of his
salvation, he may attain salvation. Similarly, if a striver recites
the name of the Lord, to someone at the time of his death, he
may attain salvation. In the scriptures, it is mentioned, that if
a saint, beholds either a man on a death-bed, or his dead body,
the smoke of his burning pyre, or the ash of his pyre, he
attains salvation.* |

* Once a religious minded gentleman was offering a little holy water
of the Ganges to the people. One of the persons said that he would not be
purified of his numberless sins with such a small quantity of holy water.
He demanded a jug of that holy water. When he was offered it he drank
it and said that he would be purged of his sins. At the time of death his
"
1015,"978 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 8

In the third and fourth verses of this chapter, the six terms, /
such as Brahma and Adhyatma etc., reveal the Lord, in His all
comprehensive forms, indicating that, all is God. Thus, a great |
soul who has realized, that in this world there is nothing else
besides, the Lord, has not to remember Him at the time of death, |
as he is all the time in a wakeful state, dream, sound sleep,
instinctively conscious of His eternal presence, in the same way,
as a common man always remembers, ""I am."" |

He may live at anyplace, holy or unholy, at anytime, day :
or night, in anystate, wakefulness, sleep, sound sleep,
unconsciousness, sickness, health etc., and in any circumstances,
he will certainly attain, salvation. Oo

Besides, the above-mentioned great souls, strivers, who
worship the Lord, in His different forms and names by
remembering anyone of His names or forms or plays or places, _
will, attain Him. .

Besides them, other believers who somehow or the other,
think of God at the time of death, though they are not engaged
continuously in His worship, also attain Him. |

Thus, the remedy of remembering the Lord at the time of
death, is not applicable to liberated souls, but only to strivers
and common people. | |

Appendix—The person, who could not attain salvation
during his lifetime, if he even at the time of death, remembering
God, departs from this body, he attains God—there is no
doubt about it. Then he who ever remembers God, if he
thinking of God at the time of death, attains God, what is
the wonder in it? The Lord has endowed the man with great
freedom so that however he may attain salvation. This is God’s
life-breath passed through the tenth door and he attained salvation. (This
anecdote was narrated by a striver.)

think of someone else? The answer follows, in the next verse.
— SS af wares Set Hea
ad aaafa aieta wet agrenfaangu
yam yam vapi smaranbhavam tyajatyante kalevaram :
tain tamevaiti kaunteya sada tadbhavabhavitah :
Whatever object or being a man thinks of at the time of his
death or departure from the body, that alone does he attain, O
Kaunteya (Arjuna) as having been always in these thoughts. 6 -
Comment:—
‘Yam yath vapi smaranbhavam tyajatyante kalevararn tam _
tamevaiti kaunteya sada tadbhavabhavitah'—In this ordinance of
the Lord, there is reflected His unique grace, that a man may ;
attain Him, merely by thinking of Him, at the time of death. If
he thinks of a dog, he gets birth as a dog, but if he thinks of
the Lord, he attains Him. How, easily attainable the Lord is!
‘Sada tadbhavabhavitah'—Whatever being, a man thinks of
at the time of death, he obtains the same body, because before
obtaining the other body he has no opportunity, no power, no
freedom, to change the thought, which he has at the time of
death. So, he remains engrossed, in the same thought. Then he,
with air, water or food etc., enters the body of a man for whose
actions, he has even the least affinity. Then, from the body of
the man, he enters the body of a woman and takes birth. If a
man thinks of a dog, at the time of death, he takes birth as a
dog. But it does not mean, that by thinking of a house or wealth,
he is born as a house or wealth. It means, that if-he dies while
thinking of a house, he may be born as a rat or a lizard in that
"
1017,"980 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 8
house, and if he thinks of wealth, at the time of death, he is born
as a snake. It means, that a person by thinking of a non-living
object, at the time of death, is born as a living being, having a -
connection, with that non-living object. 4 |

Other creatures, such as birds and animals etc., remember
objects or beings according to their actions, at the time of death
and are reborn accordingly. But, the singularity of human body
is, that his thinking at the last moment, does not depend on his.
actions, but on his own self. He is free, in having an affinity
for anyone. If he has his affinity, for the Lord, and remembers
Him at the time of death, all his artificial and assumed affinity, -
for worldly beings and objects, breaks up and he attains Him, _
because his affinity for Him 1s axiomatic.

|

(1) A being is reborn in the body, he thinks of, at the time

of death. As a man, rearing a domestic dog thinks of it at the ~
| time of death, he is born as a dog. As the programme broadcast

from a particular radio station, is received at a particular wave- -

length and then spreads in the form of sound, the thought of a

dog with which he has been connected in anyway, is caught by

him. Then the soul with subtle and causal bodies, enters the body

of the dog via water, air (breath) or food etc. Then, it enters the

body of a bitch, and takes birth as a dog, at the right time.

This can be explained, with the help of an illustration. A
person goes to a photographer and requests him, to take his
photograph. The photographer advises him to keep a smiling
face, without any movement. But when the photographer asks
him to be ready, a fly sits on his nose and so he moves his
face muscles, in order to remove that fly. The result is, that
he gets the photograph with a distorted face. In the same
way, a man is reborn, according to his thoughts at the time
of death.
"
1018,"Verse 6] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 981
As far as, the time to take a photograph, is concerned, we
know it, before hand, but we do not know, the time of death.
So, by purifying our nature and thoughts, we should ever be -
alert, and think of Him, at all times (Gita 8/5,7). | |
(2) In this directive of the Lord, seen is His justice, as
well as grace. Generally, justice and grace, seem incompatible,
because if there is justice, there cannot be grace (mercy). But,
this rule is applicable to human beings, not to the Lord, as He
is the most gracious one, and is a disinterested friend of all
beings, (Gita 5/29). So, all His ordinances and rules, are full of
justice and mercy. -
Whatever being, a man thinks of at the time of death, he
gets the same form at rebirth. If he dies thinking of a dog, he is .
reborn, as a dog. This is God's justice. But He has given freedom -
to man, to think either of a dog or of a man, or of God, and
this is His, mercy. A man can attain God, just by thinking of
Him, as he can obtain the body of a dog, by thinking of it. If a ~
man starts thinking of His justice and grace, he will be attracted
towards Him, alone. -
Appendix—lIn the twenty-first verse of the seventh chapter the
Lord declared that a man is free in his worship by the expression
“yo yo yarh yarh tanurh bhaktah’, now in this verse He mentions
the freedom of a man about the fate, he meets after death. It
means that a man is free* in his worship and also in creating his
fate after death, because of His most gracious nature, the Lord
instead of creating an obstacle, rather helps him. By misusing
this freedom, a gift of God, he meets an evil doom.
This is the special characteristic of the human life that a
man may attain whatever he wants. There 1s no rare state which
a man may not attain. A man‘can attain the state, in which
*nara tana sama nahin kavaniu dehi, jiva caracara jacata tehi. |
naraka svarga apaberga niseni, jfiana biraga bhagati subha deni.
(Manasa, Uttara. 121/5)
"
1019,"982 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 8
there is infinite bliss and - there is not even an iota of affliction
(Gita 6/22). But by hankering. after mundane: pleasures and
prosperity, he paves the way to eighty-four lac forms of life and -
hells. Therefore the Lord declares with shock—‘aprapya mam
nivartante mrtyusarmsaravartmani’ (instead of attaining Me, a man
revolves in the path of the mortal world (9/3), ‘mamaprapyaiva
kaunteya tato yantyadhamarh gatim’ (instead of attaining Me he
sinks down to lower planes)’ (16/20). | CO

Whatever a man thinks of at the time of death, the same
end he meets. In this connection there is a verse— a

vasana yasya yatra syat sa tam svapnesu pasyati 7
Svapnavanmarane jfieyam vasana tu vapurnrnam

‘Whatever longing a man has, according to that longing he
dreams. He meets his end (death) according to the dream viz., at ~
the time of death he thinks of the object according to his longing
and he meets his end according to that thought.” _— /

It means that at the time of death we cannot think of whatever
we wish, but we shall think according to our latent tendency; ;
and accordingly we shall meet our end. The thing to which we
give existence and value; with which we accept our relationship
and out of which we derive pleasure, we have latent desire for
the same thing. If we hold that the world can’t provide us with
pleasure, we shall have no such desire for the world. If there is
no such desire, then at the time of death, if any thought comes
to the mind, it will be only of God because in principle—all
is God—‘Vasudevah sarvam’. “Tarn tamevaiti’—as the thread
follows the needle, similarly whatever being, a man thinks of
at the time of death, that alone does he attain. | |

TATHAY HAY AAT Yet TI 7

Trafarriakeaniveaersray, to
tasmatsarvesu kalesu mamanusmara yudhya ca
-mayyarpitamanobuddhirmamevaisyasyasamSsayam

Therefore, think of Me at all times, and fight the war. With
your mind and intellect dedicated to Me, you will surely come
to Me. 7
Comment:—

""Tasmatsarvesu kalesu mamanusmara yudhya ca'—Here, the .
terms ‘Sarvesu kalesu’, have been used for thinking, not for a 7
fight, because any action cannot be performed at all times, as
every action has a beginning and an end, and it is everyone's
experience. But, being always conscious of the aim of God- -
realization, He, is thought of, at all times. |

When Lord Krsna exhorts Arjuna to think of Him, at all times, -
He says, that as there is a limitation of time for other activities,
such as having meals, taking sleep and earning livelihood etc.,
there is no such limitation of time, in thinking of the Lord. He ”
should be thought of, at all times.

The expression 'Yudhya ca' (and fight), has been used to tell
Arjuna, that he has obtained such an unsolicited opportunity for
war (Gita 2/32). So, he should perform this duty, by thinking
of God. But the thought of God, is primary, while performance
of the duty, is secondary. - |

‘Anusmara’ means, constant remembrance, of God. The second
interpretation is, that God does not forget any being as He has
declared, in the seventh chapter, ""I know all beings” (7/26). When
He knows all beings, it is natural for Him, to think of them.
Therefore, if this being, thinks of Him, he attains salvation. In
order to, be able to remember God, one must have a feeling of
intense love for Him. The more intense, this feeling of love is,
the oftener will, His remembrance come to one’s mind.
"
1021,"984 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 8
| ""Mayyarpitamanobuddhih'—Generally, it means, that a-striver
should surrender his mind and intellect, to Him viz., he should
think of God, with his mind and have a determination with his
intellect, to realize Him. But, it really means, that a striver should -
never think, the mind, intellect, senses and body as his own, even
by an error, as all the worldly things, belong to God. So long
as, a striver goes on thinking, that they are his own, they cannot
be purified. The thought of accepting these, as one's own, is the
main impurity which gives birth, to other impurities.
In fact, a man has his affinity only, for God, because he is
His eternal fraction. So, how can he have any affinity for nature .
(matter)? A striver, by thinking of the mind and intellect, as God's,
should surrender these to Him. Then, naturally he will realize
God, because, he had a disinclination for Him, as he had an
affinity for Nature (Matter) and its evolutes (i.e.,) the body, mind, -
intellect etc., and, affinity for these was a stumbling block. |
Some of the philosophers, regard the worldly things, as God's, -
while others regard these as prakrti's (nature's), but all of them
agree, that they are not of men. Therefore, a striver by thinking _
these of God, should surrender them, to Him. By doing so, his
eternal affinity for God, will be aroused.
‘MamevaisyasyasarnSayam'—By surrendering your mind and
intellect, to Me, you will attain Me, without any doubt, because
I am ever attained to you. But, you are unable to realize this
fact, because you have accepted your affinity, for the body and
the world. So if you surrender the mind, intellect and yourself
to Me, your eternal affinity for Me, will be revealed; there is
no doubt about it. |
Remembrance, is of three kinds—bormn of knowledge, born
of affinity, and born of action. Remembrance, born of knowledge
never ends. Remembrance born of affinity continues, so long
"
1022,"Verse 7] _ SADHAKA-SANJIVANT oe 985
as affinity continues, but remembrance born of action, is not
constant. These are referred to in detail, is as follows:
(i) Remembrance born of knowledge-——We have not to remember 7
‘I am’. But, we commit an error by identifying ourselves, with
the body. By knowledge, this error is wiped out and knowledge
of ‘I am’, remains. In the Gita, Lord Krsna declares, ""There
was never a time, when I or you and these kings, were non- |
existent; nor is it that we shall cease to be in future"" (Gita 2/12).
""This multitude of beings, born again and again, is dissolved
at the commencement of Brahma's night and rises again, at the |
commencement of his day” (8/19). In it, this multitude of beings -
1s a portion of God, and what is dissolved and born, is body. If
we renounce our assumed affinity for this perishable body, our
remembrance, born of knowledge, remains constant. -
(ii) Remembrance born of affinity—Actually, we have our
real affinity for God, not for the body and the world, because _
we are His eternal portion. But, by accepting our affinity for
the body and the world, we do not, realize our real affinity, for ;
God. As soon as, we deny the assumed affinity, our real eternal
affinity for the Lord, is automatically aroused and then there is
constant remembrance, of the Lord.
(iii) Remembrance born of action or practice—It depends
on practice. Ladies in villages, carrying a pitcher full of water,
talk and walk, but are careful about the pitcher. An acrobat, ,
while dancing and speaking, remains careful of a rope. A motor
driver, while driving, changing the gear, handling the steering
and talking to the conductor etc., remains careful about the road.
All this, depends on practice. Thus remembrance of God, while
performing different actions, is remembrance born of practice.
This remembrance (born of practice) is, also of three kinds—(a)
Remembrance of God, while performing mundane actions. In
this primary importance, is attached to actions, and secondary to,
remembrance of God. (b) Performing actions, while remembering
"
1023,"986 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter8

God. In it, primary importance is attached to the remembrance of

God, and secondary to actions. Here, a person, remains careful

that he should not forget God, even though worldly action, isnot _
- . performed properly. (c) Performing actions, thinking them as God's.

While performing actions, a striver thinks that he is fortunate

enough that he is rendering service to God, through actions,

because such actions are His. So, he has sweet remembrance of -

God, just like a father, who while performing different actions

for his daughter's marriage remembers his daughter.

_ Spiritual pursuits are of two kinds—{i) Utterance of His
name, loud chanting, listening to his sport, thinking of Him, and -
reading scriptures. (11) Performance of actions, thinking them as
God's, in order to please Him, without any selfish motive and in
accordance with, the ordinance of scriptures. Such actions, are _
also included, in spiritual pursuits. _ |

| [At the end of the seventh chapter, Lord Krsna, while
describing His entire form referred to seven facts. On those ~ : :
seven facts, Arjuna put seven questions, at the beginning of the
eighth chapter, and this topic is also over, in seven verses.] -
Appendix—The Lord in the thirtieth verse of the seventh
chapter said, ‘prayanakale’pi ca marh te vidur’ yuktacetasah’ (they
having a steadfast mind realize Me, even at the hour of death).
Arjuna in the second verse of the eighth chapter put the question,
“How can you be realised, at the hour of death, by persons of
steadfast mind?” In response to this question the Lord said, “He
who departing from the body thinks of Me alone, at the time of
death, attains Me.” He further said, “This rule is not applicable
only to those who want to attain Me. But this is a common
rule that whatever object or being a man thinks of at the time
of death, that alone does he attain.” (8/5-6). Death may visit
at any ‘time. There is no year, no month, no day, no hour, no
minute, no moment, in which a being is free from the clutches
of death. Therefore Lord Krsna exhorts Arjuna to think of Him,
"
1024,"Verse 8] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 987
at all times—‘tasmatsarvesu kalesu mamanusmara.’ “Those who
perpetually think of Me, I am easily attainable to them (8/14);
because he may depart from the body any time, he will depart
thinking of Me only, and thus will attain Me only.” ‘mayyarpita-
manobuddhih’—By thinking of God all the time, a striver’s mind
and intellect are dedicated to God. When a striver holds that
the mind and intellect are not his and he has no connection |
with them—thus by renouncing the sense of mine in mind and
intellect, they are naturally dedicated to God because they are the
Lord’s ‘apara prakrti’. Though ‘para’ and ‘apara’—both prakrtis
are of the Lord, yet para prakrti has no relation with apara but :
it has its relation only with God because it is a fragment of
God—‘mamaivarngo jivaloke’ (15/7). Therefore a striver can
be ‘mayyarpitamanobuddhi’ only when he does not accept his
affinity with apara but dedicates it (apara) to God Who is its -
master viz., never assumes apara as his and for him. |
Here within ‘mana’—‘citta’ and within ‘buddhi’—‘ahankara’ -
should also be included. When mind and intellect are dedicated,
the devotee is freed from the sense of mine and egoism. - -
In fact a devotee surrenders himself to God. When he
surrenders himself, his all, including his so-called mind and
intellect etc., are naturally surrendered to God. When all ts
surrendered to God, then ‘all’ does not persist but only God
remains—‘Vasudevah sarvam.’ | :

in the previous verse, is described, in the next verse.

O Partha (Arjuna) he, who with his mind fixed in Yoga through

Supreme Purusa (God), attains Him. 8 —
Comment:—

| [In the twenty-eighth verse of the seventh chapter, the Lord

endowed with attributes and formless, Who was described briefly :
has been detailed in the eighth, ninth and tenth verses, here.}

‘Abhyasayogayuktena'—In this expression, there are two
words 'Abhyasa', (practice) and yoga (equanimity). Practice,
means, repeated concentration of mind on God, by diverting it :
from the world, while Yoga means equanimity—""Equanimity is :
called Yoga"" (Gita 2/48). Concentration of mind, results in joy,
while its diversion leads to sadness. This is called practice, rather
than, the Yoga of practice. It is called Yoga of practice, only -
when there 1s equanimity, in joy and sorrow. A striver, instead of
attaching importance, to joy and sadness, should attach importance _
to his goal. That is establishment of mind, in Yoga.

‘Cetasé nanyagamina'—He should think of nothing else, viz., ;
he should have no aim other than, God-realization.

‘Paramami purusarh divyarh yati parthanucintayan’'—At the time
of death with such a mind, constantly engaged in contemplation,
of the Supreme Purusa viz., God endowed with attributes and
formless, a striver attains Him. ©

Appendix—Arjuna put the question—‘prayanakale ca katharh
jheyo’si niyatatmabhih’ (8/2) (How can You be realized, at the
time of death, by persons of steadfast mind?) Having answered
that question, the Lord now in the eighth, ninth and tenth verses
describes the type of those who think of God at the time of death.

He, who contemplates on the Omniscient, the ancient, the ruler, -

shining like the sun and beyond all darkness, (of ignorance). 9
Comment:— -

'Kavim'—The Lord, is Omniscient, because He knows all
the beings, and their good and evil actions.

'‘Puranam'—He is most ancient, because He is the origin of - -
everything, sentient and insentient.

'‘Anusasitaram'—He, is the Ruler and Iuminator of all the -
senses, mind, intellect and ego. Secondly, He through scriptures, |
preceptors and saints, guide men to perform their duties, and by
creating favourable and unfavourable circumstances, according
to their virtuous and evil actions, purifies them. He is called a
Ruler, as He makes ordinance for prescription and prohibition,
and also, destroys old actions, in the form of virtues and sins, ~
by enabling them to reap their fruits. | |

‘Anoraniyarnsam'—The Lord, is subtler, than even an atom.

He is the subtlest of the subtle. He is, beyond the reach of mind
and intellect. Even nature cannot be perceived, by them, because
they are the evolutes of Nature. So, how can they have, an access
to the subtlest Lord?

‘Sarvasya dhataram'—He, is the supporter and sustainer of
infinite universes. So He is called, the sustainer of all.
"
1027,"- 990 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 8
'Tamasah parastat'—He is, supremely above and beyond, the
darkness of ignorance. He is also the illuminator of ignorance.
‘Adityavarnam'—His colour, is like the sun i.e., just like the -
shining sun, the Lord is the illuminator of minds and intellects,
of all beings. All beings, receive light from Him.
_ ‘Acintyaripam'—His form, is inconceivable, to the mind
and intellect. : |
_ ‘Anusmaret’—lIt means, that one should contemplate, on God.
God knows all the beings and so He remembers them. Therefore,
they should also remember Him. :
Now, a doubt arises, as to how, to think of Him, when He
is inconceivable. The clarification is, that a firm belief, that He
is inconceivable, is in fact, the thought of Him.
Appendix—God has been called ‘kavim’ (omniscient) -
because there is nothing beyond His knowledge. He has been
called ‘puranam’ because He is beginningless, He transcends the _
limits of time viz., is the illuminator of time. He has been called
‘anusasitaram’ because all are naturally governed by Him. He is
the ruler of both—the individual soul and the world— ;

‘Prakrti is perishable and the soul, which enjoys it, is immortal
and imperishable. God governs over these two—the perishable
and the imperishable.’
The term—dhataram’ means that God sustains all beings
(Gita 15/17). The term ‘adityavarnam’ means that as there is
naturally light in the sun always, similarly in God naturally there
is always knowledge and enlightenment. God is an embodiment of
knowledge and illumines the entire universe (Gita 13/33). ‘tamasah

Comment:—

'Prayanakale manasacalena bhaktya yukto yogabalena caiva .
bhruvormadhye pranamavesya samyak sa tari param purusamupaiti
divyam'—Here, devotion stands for attraction for the Lord, and
that attraction, is one’s own, and is not of mind and intellect,
etc. The Yogi contemplates on God, Who is formless and is
endowed, with attributes.

By Yogic power, he holding the life-breath, in the space
between the two eyebrows, in the principal nerve called 'Susumna’
which is situated in the circle with two leaves (Dvidala cakra)
(leaving the body through the tenth door, situated in the skull),
reaches the Supreme Purusa.

'Tarn pararh purusamupaiti divyam'—He attains, the Supreme
Divine Lord, Who is formless and is endowed with attributes,
as described in the ninth verse. .

Whatever, was said in brief, in the eighth verse, has been
"
1029,"992 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 8
explained in detail in the ninth and tenth verses, and thus the
- topic has been concluded. .

In this context, there is a description of the worship of the -
Lord, Who is formless and is endowed with attributes. There is .
need for practice, in this worship. This practice, is not meant,
for attaining accomplishments (siddhi), but for God-realization. |
This concentration of mind, on God, at the time of death, is a
difficult task, which can be carried out, only by one who has a
full command, over his life-breath, and mind.

A striver, should first have a determination that beyond
ignorance, there is an unaffected and transcendental divinity—One, -
Who is the illuminator, base and inspirer, of all the beings. Then,
he should love Him from his heart. By doing so, his mind will
be concentrated, on Him naturally. _

Appendix—The expression ‘bhaktya yuktah’ means that
when a striver’s attachment to the world is wiped out, he has
attraction only for God, attraction for anyone else does not remain -
in him. The worldly people have attraction for ‘apara’ (lower
nature) but he, who having renounced attraction for ‘apara’, is -
attracted towards God, becomes a devotee. The worldly people
being attached to the body and the world become ‘vibhakta’
viz., separate from God but a striver who remains engrossed in |
the devotion of God, does not remain ‘vibhakta’ but becomes a
‘bhakta’ (devotee) viz., becomes one with God.

The term ‘yogabalena’ means that because of the past practice
of yoga, the state of weakness usually visiting at the time of
death cannot cause an obstacle to him, cannot cause any change
in him. The strength (power) gained by regulating breath etc.,
is “Yogabala’.

A man can attain salvation in all the orders (varnas) and

the stages of life clearly and He has described the Varnas
clearly in order to explain the people of the four Varnas (castes)

a Ksatriya (a member of the warrior class) and he wanted to

his own, worships his favourite Deity, with exclusive devotion.
He has a firm belief, that he is only God's and only God is his;
he is of none else, and none else is his. | ~
'Satatam yo mam smarati nityaSah'—'Satatam’ means
'Constantly’, from the time he is awake, to the time he goes to
sleep. ""NityaSah' means, always i.e., he thinks of Him, from the. |
day he knew Him, to the day he dies. |
'Tasyahar sulabhah partha nityayuktasya yoginah'—I am easily
attainable to such a devotee, who is absorbed in Me. 'Absorbed
in Me' does not mean, that his mind, constantly dwells on Me. -
But it means, that he is devoted to Me, in a dedicated spirit, |
with full faith and love. For instance, a Brahmana by caste,
always remembers that he is a Brahmana, not a Ksatriya or a
Vaisya. He remains a Brahmana, whether he thinks of it or not. -
Similarly, a devotee has a firm belief, that he ts only Mine and
only I am his. He, who maintains this affinity, is called ‘absorbed _
in Me.’ His senses, body, mind, intellect etc., are not his. If he
accepts his body and mind etc., as his own, I cannot be easily
attainable to him. ;
The fact is, that we have identity with the Lord, not with
the world. Our identity with the world, is impossible. But, by
an error, we identify ourselves with bodies, and think that the
Lord, is separate from us. The result is, that we have to follow
the cycle of birth and death. But, if we realize the reality, the
Lord, can be easily attainable to us. :
From the eighth verse to the thirteenth verse, the Lord
explained, that a striver should think of the Lord, Who is formless
and endowed with attributes, as well as attributeless-formless.
He can be attained by restraining the life-breath. But, at the time
of death the process of restraining the breath is difficult, and
it is easier to think of Him. The man, is an eternal fraction of
the Lord and he has had his natural affinity for Him, from time
immemorial. This affinity, is not subject to practice and action. :
"
1035,"998 : SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter8
So, by realizing this real and natural affinity for the Lord, he with
his ‘body, senses, mind and intellect, should surrender himself
to Him. By doing so, he need not worry in the least, about his
salvation or attaining the Supreme Goal, in the same way as there -
is no worry in case of damage or destruction, of an article if it
is insured. There is no difficulty in it. Therefore, the Lord; has
declared that He is easily attainable, to such a striver.
Appendix—Ananyacetah—when a devotee holds that there is

no other entity besides God, then how will his mind wander?
Why will it wander? where will it wander? Therefore he naturally .
becomes ‘ananyacetah’ viz., he whose mind is undivided and who -
depends only on God—‘satatarh yo mar smarati nityasah’—-One
is ‘to do’ and the other is ‘to take place’. Whatever is done is |
an action and whatever takes place is remembrance (memory). -
As at the end of the Gita, Arjuna said, ‘smrtirlabdha’ (18/73),

_ the memory is not an action but it is remembrance (memory)
of one’s eternal relationship (intimacy) with God. The ‘sense ;
of mine’ with God is the main factor for His memory. God 1s
mine and He is for me—by this mineness, love (devotion) for °
God naturally develops-and when we love, He is naturally and
constantly remembered by us. Therefore at the beginning of the
seventh chapter by the expression ‘mayyasaktamanah’ the Lord
has mentioned to get attached to Him viz., to love Him. It means
that when a striver regards only God as his and for him, He
becomes loving (lovable) to him. When this lovingness (lovability)
is developed, God is naturally remembered. ‘nityayuktasya’—when :
a devotee is perpetually attached to God, he is called ‘nityayukta’.
In the seventeenth verse of the seventh chapter, the same fact
has been pointed out by the expression ‘tesarh jnani nityayuktah.’
In the term nityayukta’ all the points mentioned in the first half
of the verse, are also included.

“Tasyaharn sulabhah partha’—The Lord has declared a great

soul to be rare—‘sa mahatma sudurlabhah’ (Gita 7/19) but here
"
1036,"Verse 15] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 999
the Lord declares that He is. easily attainable. It means that in |
the world God is not rare but the devotees, who having known
reality about Him, take refuge in Him, are rare. The reason
is that. if a striver seeks God, being omnipresent He will be
available everywhere, but the loving devotee of God will be
available only rarely. , -
hari duralabha nahim jagatamem, harijana duralabha hoya
hari heryam saba jaga milai, harijana kahith eka hoya
God by His grace bestows upon a man this human body,
with this body he can also pave the way to numerous wombs |
and even hells. But a devotee (saint) by showering his grace 7
leads the man to God-realization.
hari se ti jani heta kara, kara harijana se heta
hari rijhai jaga deta haim, harijana hari hi deta -
In fact He who is ever attained, about Him no question arises
whether He is attained easily or rarely. In order to renounce this
misconception, the Lord has declared that He 1s easily attainable. ;
The unreal (the body and the world) has no existence, but we
recognise its existence, value it and are attached to it; therefore ”
ever attained God has become rare. If we don’t accept the
existence of the unreal and don’t value it, God’s attainment is
self-evident (natural), ‘The unreal exists, it is ours and 1s for
us’—this assumption means to give existence to the unreal, to
value it and to be attached to it. _ | |

"
1037,"1000 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 8
Having attained Me, the great souls (Mahatma) are no more

subject to rebirth—a transitory state and the abode of sorrow; for

they have reached the state of highest perfection. 15

Comment:— :

‘Mamupetya punarjanma duhkhélayamasasvatam napnuvanti
mahatmanah samsiddhim paramam gatah'—lIf a great soul, has
vision of the Lord or knows the reality about Him, or enters
into Him, he, is not subject to rebirth. To take birth as a man
or an animal or a bird etc., is painful. Therefore, rebirth is said
to be an abode of pain.

When a man is reborn, he has to suffer so much of pain, -
as a man whose skin is stripped off. But, at that time, he is.
unable to express his pain. He simply cries. When he grows, he |
feels very sad, as his desires, are not satisfied. When he fails _
in an examination, he is so much dejected, that he thinks even
of committing suicide. In youth, he feels afflicted, on not being
married, according to his wish: On being married, he feels sad, -
not finding the spouse of his choice. When, girls attain puberty,
parents suffer from anxiety, for not being able to arrange their -
marriage. Similarly, one feels much perturbed, during his married
life, when he finds himself unable to bring up the members of
his family, with limited resources. In old age, besides suffering
from disease, he may bear insults. He develops cough and cannot
sleep properly. At the time of death also, he has to suffer a lot
of pain. Thus, there is no end of pains and sorrow for him.

Just like men, animals and birds etc., have also to suffer, a
lot of pain in’cold, hot and rainy seasons. The bigger animals
kill, the young ones of the smaller animals. Thus, they are very
sad. In this way, creatures have to suffer in hell and go through
eighty-four lac forms of lives. Therefore, rebirth has been called,
the abode of pain.

Rebirth is called transitory, because in the bodies, there is a
continuous change. Nobody is permanent, and dies. So, rebirth
"
1038,"Verse 15] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1001
is called, a path of the world of death (Gita 9/3).

Lord Krsna, might have only said, ""Having come to Me, the 7
great souls, are no more subject to rebirth."" Why has He used :
the two adjectives 'Transitory' and 'Abode of pain’? By these —
adjectives, He says that, as the Lord incarnates for the protection
of the virtuous, for the destruction of evil-doers and for the :
establishment of Dharma (Righteousness), similarly, liberated souls -
as saints are born on this earth, for the protection of the good,
for the service of the evil-doers, and for enabling the people to
follow righteousness. When the Lord incarnates, with Him they
take birth as His courtiers or companions, (like the Gvalas) on 8
the earth. But, their birth is not transitory and an abode of pain,
because their birth is not the fruit of their actions, as is by the
sweet will of the Lord. | _

The Lord, has called strivers as great souls, who possess
divine nature (9/13), as men of realization (7/19) and as those who
have attained the highest perfection (8/15). It means, that men, -
are petty souls by having their affinity for the unreal body and
the world because, they depend on the body and the world. They _-
are mere souls, when they are established in the self, because in
that case there is possibility of their having 'egoism’, in its subtle
form. But, when they identify themselves with the Lord, by total
surrender to Him, without having any independent existence of
their own, they are great souls.

Lord Krsna, in the Gita, in the Discipline of Action and

‘Knowledge, has not used the term ‘Mahatma’ (great soul). He
has used it in the Discipline of Devotion, only. It means that
He regards devotion, as supreme.

The great souls, are no more subject to rebirth, because they
have reached the highest perfection. As a greedy person desires
to get more and more money, a devotee by recognizing the Lord,
whose fraction he is, aspires to get more and more love and then
he attains fathomless and limitless love, enhancing every moment.
"
1039,"1002 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 8
This love, is the perfection of devotion, and: there is no
perfection beyond it. ce |
By studying the Gita, it is evident that Lord Krsna, has
_ attached the greatest importance to devotion. The Lord has
declared, ""He, who devoutly worships Me, is considered by Me
to be the best Yogi"" (Gita 6/47). ""I am easily attainable, to that
Yogi who constantly thinks of Me, with undivided mind, always
absorbed in Me"" (Gita 8/14). But a striver, by following anyone
of the Disciplines of Action, Knowledge or Devotion, attains the ;
same Supreme Goal. But a point needs attention here, that in
the philosophy, in which the Lord is not regarded as Supreme,
the followers by breaking off their affinity for the world, attain
salvation but do not attain the Supreme Love, and thus do not) >
get ever enhancing bliss or love. That ever enhancing bliss, or
love has been called, the highest perfection here. ;
Appendix—In the seventh chapter the Lord declared that
this world is the manifestation of God—‘Vasudevah sarvam’ -
(7/19) but here He declares that the world is the abode of
sorrows—‘duhkhalayam’. It means that the person who derives
pleasure from the worldly objects, persons and actions, for him
this world is the abode of sorrows; but he who renders service
to other persons with his objects and actions, for him the world
is the manifestation of God. The expectation, the desire and the
enjoyment of pleasures are the roots of severe sufferings. This
is the irrefutable rule that he who enjoys pleasures, can’t escape
pain. Therefore a striver should have a firm determination not
to enjoy pleasures. The moment he renounces the desire for
pleasure, Supreme Peace (God-realization) immediately follows
such renunciation—‘tyagacchantiranantaram’ (Gita 12/12).
A man (the self) is a fragment of that entire God in Whose
each pore, there are millions of universes. But he has got entangled
"
1040,"Verse 16] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI . 1003
in the body, an insignificant fragment of the lower nature. Because
of this entanglement he, instead of attaining only bliss and bliss,
is suffering only miseries and sorrows. As in the teats of a cow
where there is only milk, there a cattle-louse drinks only blood. -
Goswami Tulasidasaji Maharaja says— So
anada-sindhu-madhya tava bisa, binu jane kasa marasi piyasa

All worlds, from the abode of Brahma downwards, are by
nature subject to birth; But O Arjuna, O son of Kunti, on attaining
Me there is no rebirth. 16 -
Comment:— | | |
‘Abrahmabhuvanallokah punaravartino'rjuna'—O Arjuna! All
the worlds from the abode of Brahma downwards, are subject
to return 1.e., after living there, at the end of the enjoyment of
the fruit of their virtuous actions, men have to return.
The highest plane of existence, is said to be the abode of
Brahma. In this mortal world of ours, the king, who possesses a
prosperous kingdom, a young healthy body, no enemy, an obedient
and sincere family, and servants, is regarded as completely happy.
The mortal gods, who as a fruit of their virtuous actions, obtain
the abode of gods after enjoying that fruit, again come back to
the mortal world (Gita 9/21). They, are a hundred times happier,
than the kings. The permanent gods (Ajana devata), who at the
beginning of universe, were gods and continue to be gods, till
"
1041,"1004 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 8
the end of the universe, are a hundred times happier, than mortal
gods. Indra, the ruler of the gods, is regarded as a hundred times
happier than permanent gods. The abode of Brahma, is supposed
to possess, a hundred times more happiness, than that of Indra 7
and the bliss of a liberated soul, is regarded as a hundred times
more happy than the abode of Brahma. It means, that from the
highest region of Brahma, to the mortal world of the earth,
happiness is limited, changing and perishable. But, the bliss of
God-realization is limitless, fathomless, and permanent.
‘Punaravartinah’ also means, that a man being a fraction of
God, is eternal. But, so long as, he is unable to realize God, he -
even after attaining the highest plane of existence, of the abode
of Brahma, has to come back. :
Here a doubt arises, that even by beholding devotees, saints, ~
liberated souls and representatives of the Lord, a man attains
salvation, why do people not attain salvation by beholding
Brahma, in the abode of Brahma? Why do they retum? The __
clarification is, that the concession of salvation, by beholding,
is applicable to men of this mortal world, only because this —~
human body has been bestowed only for God-realization. This
concession, has not been granted, for the other worlds. But in
those worlds also, if anyone has a keen desire for salvation, he
can attain it. Even amongst animals and birds, there have been
devotees. But, such cases are, exceptions. Had this concession
been granted in the other worlds, all those, going to the hell must
have attained salvation, because all of them beheld ""Yamaraja’,
the god of death, a representative of the Lord. But, there is no
: mention in the scriptures, that they attained salvation. It proves,
that in other worlds, a man even by beholding the liberated souls
etc., does not attain salvation.
' This embodied soul is an eternal fraction of God. Divine
"
1042,"Verse 16] _ SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1005
abode is that whence there is no return. As a man after finishing
his journey returns to his home so this embodied being, having |
a fraction of divinity should also return to the supreme abode of
his Lord whence there is no return. Question arises as to why -
after death does it return? |
As a man, goes to a divine discourse, he returns to his house,
after listening to it. But, if he forgets anything there, he has to
go back again, to take it. Similarly if the soul, gets attached
to wealth, property and family etc., it has to come back. The
body dies, so it has to occupy place in any other body, of a
man or an animal or a bird etc. The Lord, declares in the Gita, ~
""Attachment to the three types (modes), born of Nature, is the
cause of his birth, in good and evil wombs"" (13/21). It means, |
that he, who has desire and attachment, for the world, will have -
to come back. : |
_ ‘Mamupetya tu kaunteya punarjanma na vidyate'—'Al] the ;
worlds, from the abode of Brahma downwards, are subject to
rebirth. But on attaining Me there is no rebirth.' Here 'Mamupetya’
(having attained Me) means ""See Me in reality, know Me in -
essence, and enter into Me"" (Gita 11/54). | |
The soul, has not to come back, because being a fraction of
the Lord it reaches Him, and the Supreme Abode of the Lord, is
its real home. Its real home, is not the abode of Brahma etc., and
so it has to come back from there. As a man, can board a bus
or a train only upto the station, for which he has got the ticket,
and then he has to get off. Similarly, a man has to come back,
after enjoying the fruit of his virtuous actions, in the worlds of
the gods. But if he is in his own house, he has not to leave it.
A man cannot attain salvation, even after reaching the highest
plane of existence. So a striver, should never aspire to enjoy the
pleasure of the higher worlds.
All the worlds, including that of Brahma, lead a man to
bondage. Those persons who reach abode of Brahma and return
"
1043,"1006 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 8
possess demoniac properties. This demoniac disposition leads one
to bondage. If the man takes refuge in God, he is liberated from
the bondage, because he possesses divine virtues (Gita 16/5).
There are two kinds of persons, who go to the abode of
Brahma—those who perform virtuous deeds in order to enjoy
the pleasures of the abode of Brahma, and those whose aim |
is to attain God, but at the time of death, because of having
a desire for pleasure, deviate from spiritual discipline and so °
they have to go to the world of Brahma. The latter, at the time
of final annihilation, are liberated with Brahma, after enjoying .
pleasure there. This liberation is called 'Krama-Mukti', (gradual
liberation or gradual salvation), when Brahma after his span of 7
life vacates the place for the succeeding Brahma. But strivers,
who realize the Lord here, their salvation is called 'Sadyo-Mukti'
(instant Salvation).
In the second verse of this chapter, Arjuna asked Lord -
Krsna, “How are You to be realized, at the time of death?""
Lord Krsna, answered this question, in the fifth verse. In the
sixth verse, He explained the general rule that the predominating
‘thought of the last moment, determines one's future destiny. In
the seventh verse, He asks Arjuna, to think of Him, at all times.
This seventh verse, is connected with the fourteenth verse. In
between (from the eighth to the thirteenth verse) there is, context
of the Lord, Who is endowed with attributes and is formless,
and also attributeless-formless Lord.
The verses, eighth to sixteenth, prove that Lord Krsna is the |
Supreme Lord, Who is endowed with attributes and is formless as
well as the Lord, Who is attributeless and formless. So the supreme
aim of a man's life is to attain ever-enhancing love for Him.
Appendix—Here a man may raise a doubt that when all
worlds, from the abode of Brahma downwards, are manifestations
"
1044,"Verse 16] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1007
of God—‘Vasudevah sarvam’, then why are the people who
go to those worlds, being reborn? The clarification is that the
people, who go to those worlds, don’t consider the worlds the
manifestation of God but regard them as material for pleasure
(Gita 9/21). They go to the abode of Brahma to enjoy pleasures.
As the fruit of their virtuous deeds, they attain the worlds upto
the abode of Brahma and (when they exhaust their merit), they
are reborn in the world of mortals. © .
Attachment to pleasure is the root of rebirth. Here the Lord
by the expression ‘abrahmabhuvanallokah’ means that a man has
to return to the mortal world even after reaching the abode of
Brahma, the last limit of the mundane pleasures. All the pleasures :
of infinite universes cannot make a man happy and cannot free ;
him from the pangs of birth and death, therefore he who hopes
to derive pleasure from the world, is under illusion. -
Two types of people go to the abode of Brahma—those
who go to the abode of Brahma in order to enjoy pleasures and
then return to this mortal world; and the others are those who
along the bright path go to the abode of Brahma and then with
Brahma they are liberated (Gita 8/24). They don’t return to this ”
mortal world, this is because of the glory of their aim, it is not
the glory of Brahmaloka (abode of Brahma). One has certainly
to return from the abode of Brahma because neither an enjoyer
nor a Yogi can live there forever. All upto the abode of Brahma
is the fruit of action. When every action has a beginning and an
end, then how can its fruit be imperishable?
The term ‘mam’ in ‘mamupetya’ denotes entire-God (God in
full), Who is the master of both para and apara. Having attained
Him, there is no birth in this sorrowful world. But such God-
realized souls also by God’s will, can descend to this mortal
world either as the representatives of God (Karaka purusa) or
as His incarnation. But such a birth does not depend on the
performance of actions but it depends on God’s will.

combination of the four ages—satya, treta, dvapara and kali is -
called, a fourfold age. A day of Brahma, lasts such a thousand
fourfold age and so does his night.* With this standard of time,
Brahma's age is of a hundred years. Then Brahma, after his span |
of time, merges into God, his world merges into. nature and ;
nature merges, into God. All those, who are born, are subject to
death. The greatest pleasures, which are born of sense-contacts,
are verily sources of pain (Gita 5/22), and have a beginning and
an end, while only God is beyond time. Thus, knowing this fact,
the great souls do not attach the least importance to the heavenly
* A day of the gods lasts men's six months and so does a night. Thus a year
of the gods lasts three hundred and sixty years of men. Similarly the duration of
the four ages—Satya, Treta, Dvapara and Kali is equal to a divine age of the gods.
It means that a divine age of the gods is equal to—-Satya age of seventeen lac and
twenty-eight thousand years, Treta age of twelve lac and ninety-six thousand years, |
Dvapara age of eight lac and sixty-four thousand years and Kali age of four lac
and thirty-two thousand years—total forty-three lac and twenty thousand years. It
is also called 'Mahayuga' or 'Caturyugt’. Brahma’s one day lasts a thousand divine
ages of the gods (men's four thousand, three hundred and twenty million years)
and so does his night. This day.of Brahm is called 'Kalpa’ or ‘Sarga' (Creation)
and the night is called ""Pralaya' (Dissolution). .

'Avyaktadvyaktayah sarvah prabhavantyaharagame ratryagame .

been called 'manifest’, and, in the fourth verse of the fourteenth
chapter, they have been called ‘forms’. As an embodied one, :
has his self-made creation of 'I' and 'mine', when he wakes up
_ from sleep and that creation merges in him, when he is asleep.
Similarly, a multitude of beings, is dragged into the manifest state,
from Brahma’'s subtle body viz., prakrti, when Brahma wakes up
and they merge in his subtle body then he retires to sleep. It
means, that when Brahma wakes up, there is creation and when
he retires to sleep, there is dissolution. But, when his life-span
of a hundred. years is over, there 1s final annihilation, in which
Brahma merges into the Lord. The span of final annihilation,
is equal to the age of Brahma. At the end of the span of final
annihilation, Brahma emanates from the Lord and then there is
a new creation of the universe (Gita 9/7-8).
_ Appendix—In the sixteenth verse the Lord declared that all
worlds, from the abode of Brahma downwards, are subject to
"
1047,"1010 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter8
retum. Why are they subject to return? The Lord answers the
question in the seventeenth and eighteenth verses that the highest
plane of existence, the abode of Brahma, is within the limits of
time. Describing that period the Lord mentions that however -
long that period may look but that is within the limits of time.
But God is beyond the limits of time. |
As when we are asleep at night, we forget the. world and
when we awake in the morning, the world is again thought of,
similarly the entire creation merges when Brahmaji retires to
sleep and in Brahma’s day the creation is manifest again. This |

This multitude of beings, born again and again, under compulsion

Comment:—
'Bhiitagramah sa evayam'—This multitude of beings, which
is subject to birth and death, from time immemorial, being a
fraction of the Lord, is eternal and imperishable. It remains the
same, at the time of creation and dissolution, as also on new
creation and final dissolution. But by an error, beings assume their
affinity with nature and its evolutes—body and worldly objects
etc., which are kaleidoscopic and perishable. They do not want
to leave, the bodies but these get discarded. Thus man (soul) has
to be born and then, decay again and again. The wheel of birth
"
1048,"Verse 19] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1011
will continue, as long as, he continues his affinity with the body . |
and the world, which he assumed himself. He is free and capable :
of snapping this tie. Actually, he cannot keep this association
permanently, because objects are ephemeral and perishable.

The Lord, created the multitude of beings, for His recreation, :
with a lot of material for sport. It is a rule of a game, (sport), |
that its materials, are only for the game's sake, not for laying
personal claim on them. The beings, instead of taking part in the
sport, attach themselves to the material, accepting it as their own,
and thus getting entangled in it. So they have a disinclination,
for God. | CO -

'Bhitva bhitva praliyate'—Bodies are born and they die again. :
There is a constant change, in them. But the changeless soul, by :
having its affinity with the bodies, accepts their change, their -
birth and death, as its own. To be born and to die is 'Paradharma’, |
and to realize God 1s, 'Svadharma’.

'Ratryagame'vasah partha prabhavatyaharagame'—Man by :
assuming the things, as his own, thinks that he is their master,
but actually he becomes a slave to them. The more things, he -
possesses, the more dependent he becomes. He can never be
liberated, from this dependence, unless he attains, God. So long
as, he continues his affinity with nature, he will have to follow,
the wheel of birth and death. By performing actions, and reaping
their fruits, even at the time when Brahma wakes up (creation),
and when he retires to sleep (dissolution) (8/18), at the time
when Brahma manifests himself (new creation), and when he
merges in the Lord (final dissolution) (9/7-8) and when he is
made to act helplessly, by the modes of nature (3/5). It means,
that he cannot be free from the painful cycle of birth and death,
unless he realizes the self or God, and unless he renounces his
affinity with nature. But when he is. not swayed by Nature and
objects born of Nature viz., he realizes the pure self, by totally
renouncing affinity with nature, he is not reborn, even at the
"
1049,"1012 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 8
time of new creation and is not tormented at the time of final :
dissolution (Gita 14/2).

He 1s subject to birth and death, only because he attaches
importance to material objects. The helplessness of his birth and
death is known as such, because of time, nature, action or modes. |
This helplessness continues, so long as, he derives pleasure which
are born of sense-contacts. He, does not want to renounce this
desire, and so he remains helpless. He thinks, that he is unable
to be liberated from it, but actually this desire is self-made, and
so it is his responsibility to renounce it. He can renounce it, if
and when, he has a firm determination. -

Appendix—There are two divisions—one division-is of the
kaleidoscopic world, the other division is of the unchanging -
divine entity. The multitude of beings, which is subject to birth _
and death from time immemorial, is born and merges again
and again. The being, during the day and night of Brahma,
is born and dies again and again, It means that the unreal, |
which is born and merges is the world and that (the real), 7
which remains the same (which was at the time of creation) -
is the self viz., the divine entity which is a fragment of God.
Brahmayji’s numberless nights and days may pass, but the self
ever remains the same. | : |

In the divine entity viz., in the self there is power to be attached
to someone or something or to remain detached. By misusing
the power viz., by being attached to matter, he is born and he
dies—‘karanarh gunasango’ sya sadasadyonijanmasu’ (Gita 13/21).
If he does not misuse this power, he cannot pave the way to birth
and death. Therefore the main valour or objective of a man is not
to be attached to matter but it is to be established in the self or
take refuge in God, Whose fragment he (the self) is. In matter
viz., In space, time, thing, person, action, state, circumstance, a
change occurs, while in the self a change never occurs——this is
every man’s experience. But in spite of this experience a man
"
1050,"Verse 19] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1013
remains bound by matter because of his attachment to pleasure
and so he does not realize the self but remains forgetful of the
self just like beasts and birds.

‘Avasah’—By being attached to the lower nature, a man .
(the self) becomes helpless—‘bhutagramamimam krtsnamavasarh
prakrtervasat’ (Gita 9/8).* Therefore when the assumed attachment
to Prakrti is renounced, he is liberated. , :

Our existence does not depend on the lower nature viz., on
objects, persons. and actions. Everything is born and perishes,
every man is born (union) and dies (disunion) and every action

begins and ends. But entity (self) which knows these three -
(objects, persons and actions) does not undergo any origin and
destruction, birth and death (union and disunion), beginning and ""
end. That existence (entity) ever remains the same—‘bhitagramah _
sa evayam’.* This entity never ceases to be—‘nabhavo vidyate
satah’ (Gita 2/16). The realization of the natural establishment
in this entity (self) is liberation or salvation (independence). -

A man cherishes a false notion that having acquired a
particular object, having met a particular person and having -
done a particular action, he will be free (liberated). But there
is no such object or person or action which may lead him to
liberation. The objects, persons and actions of Prakrti make a
man a slave. By becoming totally detached from them, a man
can become free. Therefore a striver should form the habit of
realizing that he is alone having no connection to objects, persons
and actions, he should attach importance to this realization and
remain established in it as much as he can. This is every one’s
experience that in sound sleep we live without objects, persons
and actions but objects, persons and actions don’t live without

* Here in (8/19) and in (9/8)—in both the verses ‘bhiitagrama’ and
‘avaSa’ words have been used. The difference is that here is the description
of creation and dissolution and in 9/8 there is description of new creation and
final dissolution. :
"
1051,"1014 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 8
us. When we form the habit of living without them even in the
state of wakefulness then we shall become independent (liberated). 7
The assumption of our affinity with objects, persons and actions
does not let us be independent and makes us dependent, though
we don’t wish so. oo | |
| In God there are endless powers which are divine. In ‘Maya’

(prakrti) also there are endless powers but they are inert and
kaleidoscopic—‘mayadhyaksena prakrtih siiyate sacaracaram’
(9/10). In devotion (love) for God, there is the most unique
power. But that love is not revealed, as a striver gets satisfied
in salvation (independence). There is dependence only by having -
affinity with matter; and when salvation is attained, that dependence
totally perishes and the striver (self) becomes independent. But
love (devotion) is more unique than this salvation. In salvation — .
there is ‘akhanda’ (constant) bliss but in love there is ‘ananta’
(infinite) bliss. oo

A Jnanayogi attains salvation and a devotee attains love. In ""
Bhaktiyoga a devotee is not dependent on God because God is —
not alien but He is a devotee’s own. Submission to one’s own -
is a special type of independence. |

God is the most independent. A man (the self) becomes _
dependent on matter. If he destroys this dependence, he becomes
independent. But if he takes refuge in God, he becomes supremely
independent. Submission to God is the supreme independence
in which even God becomes submissive to the devotee—‘aharm
bhakta paradhinah (Srimadbha. 9/4/63).

Beyond this unmanifest (Brahma's subtle body), there is yet
another unmanifested Eternal Existence, which does not perish, -
even though all beings perish. 20 |
Comment:— | | |

‘Parastasmattu§ bhavo'nyo'vyakto'vyaktatsanatanah'—From -
the sixteenth to the nineteenth verse, it has been said that all
the worlds, from the abode of Brahma downwards, are subject
to rebirth. But the Eternal Existence, is different from them—so
the term 'Tu' (but), is used. a -

The word 'Avyaktat', stands for the subtle body of Brahma, |
because in the eighteenth and nineteenth verses, it has been
mentioned that all manifest beings, emanate from Brahma's subtle -
body, and again they merge in the same. The term 'Tasmiat’,
also stands for Brahma's subtle body. The unmanifest Eternal -
Existence, is beyond Brahma’s subtle body, as well as, his causal
body (primordial matter).

Beyond Brahma's subtle body, there are two existences—
primordial matter and God. This context, pertains to God. So
unmanifested Eternal Existence, has been used for God, Who
does not perish even when all beings, perish.

In the Gita, all beings have been called unmanifest (2/28);

Brahma's subtle body has also been called unmanifest (8/18);
Matter or nature, has also been called unmanifest (13/5). Beyond,
all of them, the form of the Lord, whether manifest or unmanifest,
is ever-existent. He was neither absent nor will be. He, can never
be missing as He is eternal. He is Supreme. None can, ever be
superior to Him. ss oe

""Yah sa sarvesu bhitesu nasyatsu na_vinasyati'—The
unmanifested Existence, never perishes, even though, all beings
perish. In that Absolute Existence, there is not the least modification,
while in the entire universe, there are so many modifications.

undergoes any change and Apara is ever kaleidoscopic. Apara
never persists without change, cannot persist at all. It undergoes
change in Brahma’s day and Brahma’s night and even in new
creation and final dissolution. | Oe
_, If, para and apara—both entities are unchanging, the
wheel of birth and death may end, and if both are kaleidoscopic,
then also the wheel of birth and death may end. But the para
in spite of being immutable, has assumed its affinity . with |
changeful apara and so it is ensnared in the wheel of birth and :
death. The soul by having affinity with jagat (world) has become |
jagat (Gita 7/13). As a man by boarding a moving train, moves
himself, similarly a man (the self) by seizing the kaleidoscopic -
world has become mutable (kaleidoscopic) and has started
going astray in numerous wombs. | |

the primordial matter (causal body) is superior to the subtle body

Ancient, the Ruler’ etc., in the ninth verse, 'Mam' (Me) in the
thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth verses, 'Unmanifest'

_ and ‘Eternal’, in the twentieth verse, has been called here
'Unmanifest’, ‘Imperishable’, 'the Supreme Goal’ and 'the Supreme

twenty-seventh verse of the fourteenth chapter, He has declared, =—=s—©
""I am the Abode of Brahma, the Immortal and the Immutable, |
the eternal Dharma (virtue), and Absolute Bliss."" Thus, the Lord
has explained here that He, Who has been described in different ~~
verses by different names, is One and the same. |

Some people, think that the fruit of adoration of the Lord, ;
Who is endowed with attributes, and He, Who is attributeless,

_1s different. To remove this misconception, Lord Krsna, in this
verse, has made it clear that the Lord is one, and the same, and -
devotees according to their tastes and beliefs worshipping Him, in
different ways and His different forms, attain the same: Lord.

The other worlds, including that of Brahma are subject to
return i.e., beings after going there, have to return and thus they
have to follow the wheel of birth and death, because they all, are
within the domain of nature (matter) and are perishable, while
the Abode of the Lord, is beyond Nature and is Imperishable.
The beings, after going there, have no return, no birth. But, just
like the Lord, Who incarnates by His own will, to enable the

people to attain salvation the liberated souls by the Lord's will,
can come to this earth as representatives of the Lord, in order
to enable the people. of this mortal world, to attain salvation.

Comment:— oe
""Yasyantahsthani bhitani yena sarvamidam tatam'—Lord ;
Krsna, in the twelfth verse of the seventh chapter, said in the
negative, ""Whatever, entities there are born of sattva (quality
of goodness), of rajas (principle of activity) (mode of passion),
of tamas (principle of inertia) (mode of ignorance), know them
all as evolved from Me alone. In reality, however, neither I
exist in them, nor do they exist in Me."" Here, He says in the
_ affirmative, ""All beings reside in Me and I pervade the whole
world."" This fact has been explained, both in the affirmative
and in the negative, in the fourth, fifth and sixth verses of the
ninth chapter. It means, that beings have no existence, apart
from the Lord. They emanate from Him, reside in Him and
merge into Him. :
The Supreme Lord, pervades everywhere, every time, in
"
1056,"Verse 22] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1019

all things, actions and beings etc. Though ornaments made of

gold, have nothing besides gold, yet people do not pay attention

to. gold, because they attach importance to the shapes, names,

weights and prices etc., of different ornaments. Similarly, we -

being entangled in favourable and unfavourable circumstances

of the perishable world, do not pay attention to the Lord, Who

existed before the creation, exists now, and will continue to

exist after the dissolution of the creation. |
'Purusah sa parah partha bhakty4 labhyastvananyaya'—In the

previous verse, the Lord Who has been called the Unmanifest, -

the Imperishable, the Supreme Goal etc., has been called

here that Supreme Purusa, Who can be attained, by exclusive

devotion only. -
Devotees, who attach importance to the evolutes of Nature,

which are called ‘others’, by accepting their independent

existence, have no exclusive devotion, to the Lord, so they -

cannot attain the Lord quickly. If they accept every being, thing

and action, as His manifestation, and then perform actions, in -

order to, please Him only, their devotion is exclusive, and so

they attain the Supreme Lord. As water, exists as snow, hail,

cloud, fog, dew, vapour, river, pond and sea etc., the gross,

subtle and causal universe, which seems, is nothing besides the |

Lord. Therefore, all his actions such as eating, drinking, sitting,

walking, speaking, sleeping etc., are nothing, but adoration of

the Lord (Gita 18/46). |
Arjuna's question, ""How are you to be known, at the

time of death?"" (8/2) seems to be full of emotion, because

in spite of beholding, the Lord before him, he became curious

to know His singularity. In response to his question, the Lord

explains the general rule of thinking of Him, at the time of
"
1057,"1020 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 8
death, direct him to think of Him, at all times. Then, from the
eighth verse to the sixteenth verse, He explained how to attain
the Lord ‘Endowed with attributes and formless’, 'Attributeless
and formless’, and ‘Endowed with attributes, and form', each in -
three verses. Out of the three, He explained, that attaining the
Lord 'Endowed with attributes and formless’ and 'Attributeless
and formless’, is difficult, because all the media of perception
have to be restrained, while He, endowed with attributes and
form, can be attained easily, depending on Him, and constantly
by thinking of Him. .
| After the sixteenth verse, Lord Krsna, in the next six -
verses, explained the special importance of the Lord, Who is .
endowed with attributes and form. In the first three verses,
He explained the duration of Brahma, and his world, while -
in the next three verses, He explained the superiority of His
Own, and His Abode. It means, that He is exceptional than |
the subtle body of Brahma. All forms of worship, are within
His form. He can be realized, through supreme devotion. On ;
His realization, strivers are not inclined towards other gods,
nor is there any need for them. Then, He explained, that He |
can be attained, by exclusive devotion. |
Thus, His abode is superior to Brahma's, and His form is
superior, to that of Brahma. It means, that He is the ultimate
goal of all beings, and they are all within Him. :
Appendix—tThe devotion has been called exclusive (ananya)—
it means that in devotion, there should neither be the smallest
fragment of matter nor any latent impression of ego, nor any
impression of one’s own opinion viz., there should not be
the least attraction anywhere. All is God-——this realization is
‘ananyabhakti’ (exclusive devotion).
Craving for pleasures is only one but the material for pleasures
of increasing degrees is available in numerous worlds. When
"
1058,"Verse 23] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1021
a striver is not attracted even by the pleasures available in the
abode of Brahma and is not even satisfied with salvation, then
he attains devotion. | ,
In the seventh chapter the Lord declared “mattah paratararh :
nanyat kincidasti’ (7/7), the same fact has been mentioned here
by the expression ‘yasyantah sthani bhitani yena sarvamidarh
tatam.’ The same fact will be mentioned in detail in the fourth
and fifth verses of the ninth chapter. All this means that there
is nothing else besides God viz., all is God.
Link:—In the sixteenth verse, Lord Krsna explained, that all -
the worlds from the abode of Brahma downwards, are subject
to return, but on attaining Him, there is no rebirth. But, He
has not explained the time (path) whence they do not return |
and also the time (path), for departing, whence they return. So
He starts the topic— |

Comment:— |
[Liberation from bondage in the mortal world, is called
‘Sadyo Mukti’ (instant Salvation) i.e., those who attain God by
exclusive devotion, attain the highest perfection. Those who
have subtle desire, at the time of death, go to the abode
of Brahma, and then are liberated with him. This salvation,
is called 'Krama Mukti’ (gradual Salvation). Those who go
"
1059,"1022 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA —s[Chapter8

to the abode of Brahma, to enjoy pleasure, are subject to

return. ‘Sadyo Mukti’ (Salvation in this mortal world) has been

described, in the fifteenth verse. Lord Krsna, starts the topic

to explain the other two.] — -
""Yatra kale tvanavrttimavrttim caiva yoginah prayata yanti

been used to point out the topic which was left untouched.

The word ‘Kala’, stands for the path, which has been named

as 'Gati' and 'Srti', in verses twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh

respectively, in this chapter. -
‘Anavrttimavrttim'—Devotees, who possess discrimination

i.c., who have a disinclination for worldly things and pleasures, ~

and an inclination for God, depart never to return. Because _

Of disinterestedness in their path, there is predominance of

light (discrimination). But those, who have a disinclination for

God, and are entangled in attachment'and pleasure, depart to

return, because their discrimination is covered. Their path is dark

viz., there is predominance of ignorance. The term ‘Caiva'’ (and -

even), is used for those, whose aim has been to realize God

but at the time of death they have deviated from the path due

to some desires lurking 1n them and so they after enjoying the

heavenly pleasure, come back. Here, the word ""Yoginah', has |

been used, both for those, who do not desire, the fruit of

their actions, as also, for those who have a desire, for the

fruit of their actions.

‘Agnirjyotirahah Suklah sanmasa uttarayanam'—lIn the bright -

at night, and that light works, for a short distance and for a :
short time, while the day-light, works for a longer distance -
and a longer time. A bright fortnight, is the night of manes.
The light of this bright fortnight, remains for a very long
distance and for many days in the sky. The northern path -
of the sun, is of six months, and is equal to a day of the
gods. The light in the northern path, remains for a very long -
distance and time. _ / |
‘Tatra prayata gacchanti brahma brahmavido janah'—Those,
who pass along the bright path, first go to the territory, of the

and he hands them over to the god of the northward course
of the sun, and he hands them over to the god, of the
abode of Brahma. Then with Brahmi, they are liberated and
attain God. —_
Here, the term 'Brahmavidah', has been used for those who
know Brahma, and not for those, who have realized Him. If they
had realized Him, they would have been liberated souls, they
would not have gone, to the abode of Brahma.

the god of smoke, hands over those, who pass along that
path to the god of night, when they have crossed his territory.
Similarly, the god of night, hands them over to the god of
dark fortnight, who hands them over to the god of the southern

they attain the divine worlds, such as heaven etc. Then after
enjoying pleasure as fruit of their merit and virtue, they have
to return. |
Here, a point needs attention, that the lunar sphere which 1s
seen, 1s not the lunar world, mentioned here, because the lunar
sphere is near the earth, while the lunar world, is farther than
even the sun. The nectar (energy), to the lunar sphere, comes from
the lunar world, and that energy nourishes, all herbs and plants.
"
1063,"1026 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA _ [Chapter8
Here, the dark path stands, for the path which leads to the
higher worlds. It has been called dark, because it is darker than
the bright path. Ordinary men, are born in the mortal world after
death, sinners go to the demoniac wombs, while vile sinners, to _
... hell. Thus those, who pass along the dark path, are far superior
a to those who take demoniac births or go to hell, because this
- path is better and brighter, than other paths which lead, to the
| cycle of birth and death. _
While returning from the dark path, the soul first comes to the
sky, then to the clouds through air; and through rain, it enters the ;
grain. Then, it enters men, when they. eat food according to the ~
fruit of actions, of the previous birth. From man it goes to woman,
and takes birth. Thus, it follows the wheel of birth and death. :
Now a question arises, as to why the Lord has called the ~
people who perform actions, for their fruit, Yogis (ascetics).
There can be several reasons—
(i) The Lord in the Gita declares, that those who are established
in sattva (the quality of goodness), go to higher regions, while -
others go to middle or lower regions (Gita 14/18). Here, there
is a description of those, who go to the higher regions. Thus
being superior to those, who go to the middle or lower regions,
they have been called Yogis.
(it) They go to higher worlds, for enjoying heavenly pleasures,
after having renounced mundane pleasures by self-control. They
have been called Yogis, because they become equanimous to
some degree, whether they receive mundane pleasures or not
in this world. |
(111) Their aim has been to realize God. But, at the time of
death, they deviate from Yoga, because of their subtle desire
for pleasure, so they go to higher worlds, such as the abode of
Brahma etc. After living there for a long time, they are born, in
the houses of pious and wealthy men. Devotees, who deviate from
"
1064,"Verse 25] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI - 1027
Yoga, go along this dark path. As persons, having an interested
motive also pass through this path of yoga. Therefore they have
been called Yogis.
In the twenty-fourth verse, Lord Krsna has used the expression
‘Brahmavido janah' (Brahma knowing people), in plural number, -
while in this verse He has used the term 'Yogr’,, in singular. It
shows, that all men deserve God-realization and it is easy to
attain Him, because He is naturally attained to all. So, the Lord, |
has used a plural number. But it is difficult to attain heaven,
etc., because so many efforts have to be made and so many
rituals to be observed, by a person. Moreover, from heaven he _
has to return to this mortal world. So, here a singular number
has been used.
:
(1) Those, whose aim is to realize God, but their desire for
pleasure 1s not rooted out, go to the abode of Brahma. Thereafter, :
enjoying pleasure, their desire 1s wiped out and they are liberated
from the bondage of birth and death, as described in the twenty- -
fourth verse. .
Those, whose aim is to realize God, and have no desire for
pleasure here or hereafter, but at the tume of death deviate from
meditation on the attributeless Lord, are directly born, in the
family of enlightened Yogis. There, by striving with greater vigour
than before, for perfection, they attain salvation (Gita 6/42-43).
Those, whose aim is to enjoy heavenly pleasures, ascend
heaven, by virtue of their meritorious deeds, and return to the earth,
when their fruit has been enjoyed (Gita 7/20—23; 8/25; 9/20-21).
Those, whose aim is to realize God, and deviate from
Yoga, because they could not root out the desire for worldly
pleasures, at the time of death. So they obtain higher worlds,
such as heaven etc., enjoy pleasures there, and then, take birth
"
1065,"1028 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 8
in the house of pious and wealthy men. There, by their former
practice, they are drawn towards God and reach the Supreme
Goal (Gita 6/41,.44-45). Such strivers, are far superior to those,
whose aim is. to enjoy heavenly pleasures. |
(2) Generally, people think that those who die, in day time, in a
a bright fortnight, and in the six months of the northward course
of the sun, attain salvation, but those who die in nighttime, in
a dark fortnight and in the six months of the southern passage
of the sun, do not attain salvation. But, actually it is not so.
This description has been given, only for those who go to _
higher regions. It does not apply to those, who go to hell or _
take birth in evil species. The fact, is that beings go to higher
or lower regions, according to their actions, whether they die,
in the daytime or nighttime, bright fortnight or dark fortnight, _
or northern or southern solstice.
Devotees who take refuge in the Lord, attain Him, whether
they die in the daytime or nighttime, bright fortnight or dark :
fortnight, or northward course of the sun, or the southward
course of the sun. -
Now a doubt arises why Bhisma, a liberated soul, waited
for the northward course of the ‘sun, in leaving his mortal
body. The clarification 1s, that Bhisma had not to go to the
Abode of God. He being a god named Vasu, had to go to
the world of the gods. There the doors remain closed, at the
time of the southward course of the sun. So, if he went at
that time, he would wait outside, to enter his world. He had
the power to die, anytime, as he willed. So he thought it
better to die and wait, as he could behold Lord Krsna, and
have good company, which would be useful for the welfare of
everyone. So, he left the body, at the time of the northward
course of the sun.

- In Upanisads the order of the dark fortnight has been given
in different ways— | ,
According to Chandogyopanisad—the god of smoke, the god.
of night, the god of the dark fortnight, the god of the southern
solstice, the abode of manes, the sky, the moon and then return
to the mortal world (5/10/3-4) | |
According to brhadaranyakopanisad—the deity of smoke,
the deity of night, the deity of the dark fortnight, the deity of
the southern solstice, the abode of manes, moon and then return |
to the mortal world (6/2/16). : :
In Upanisads the dark fortnight has been named—‘pitryana’, -
dhumamarga’ and ‘daksinamarga’ also. :

of the two paths. | |

These two paths—the bright and the dark, are considered to
be the world's eternal paths. Proceeding by one, a man has not to |
return, while taking the other, he returns. 26
Comment:—
‘Suklakrsne gati hyete jagatah Sasvate mate'—All creatures, |
according to their actions, or by God's grace, sometime or
Other, receive this human life, and then according to the
actions of this human life, go to higher, middle or lower
regions. Now, it depends upon them, whether they pass along
the bright path or the dark path, because they are all linked
to the two paths.
"
1067,"1030 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 8
- So long as, men attach importance to perishable objects
of the world, and have a desire for them, they can go to
lower regions, even after reaching higher ones. Similarly, being
fraction of the Lord, they can go,.to the higher regions. So,
a striver should ever be alert and cautious. He should, never :
attach importance to perishable things of the world and should
never hate a person, because that person being a fraction of
the Lord, may be inclined towards Him any time.
As the Lord, has declared Yoga as imperishable, the two
paths, bright and dark, are also imperishable and eternal.
| 'Ekaya yatyanavrttimanyayavartate |§ punah'—Strivers - |
proceeding by the bright path, have not to return; they go to :
the abode of Brahma, and attain emancipation, with Brahma.
But persons proceeding by the dark path, return i.e., follow the
cycle of birth and death. | -
OD ODES ID a .
Link:—Lord Krsna, in the next verse, gives the merit of
knowing, the two paths. :
a Gat ore srrarit qafa wert
TAA Hrergy ATHY AARATH Vo tt
naite srti partha jananyogi muhyati kaScana
_ tasmatsarvesu. kalesu) yogayukto bhavarjuna
Knowing these two paths in essence, O Partha, no Yogi is
deluded. Therefore, O Arjuna, be saturated with Yoga, at all
times. 27
Comment:—
‘Naite srti partha jananyogi muhyati kaScana'—Strivers, who
do not attach importance to perishable objects, are followers
of bright path. But those persons, who are engrossed in
the world and whose aim is to hanker after prosperity and
pleasures, are in complete darkness. People who by controlling.
"
1068,"Verse 27] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1031
their senses, from the worldly pleasures, perform actions, such

as oblation, penance and charity etc., in order to enjoy the
heavenly pleasures, are also in the dark, because they have; to

return from the higher regions, and have to follow the wheel .
of birth and death. | | oo

Thus, a striver by knowing the secret of the two paths, becomes
a Yogi i.e., he performs actions without having any desire for
the fruit of actions, because he transcends the pleasures of this
world, as well as, of the next one. Thus, he is not deluded. —

A Yogi, is he whose aim, is to remain equanimous,-in.. ~
acquisition and non-acquisition, of worldly pleasure. | :
‘Tasmatsarvesu kalesu yogayukto bhavarjuna'—One who is
determined, that he has to realize God, remains equanimous, ;
in favourable and unfavourable circumstances, and incidents
etc. Therefore Lord Krsna directs Arjuna to be established in
Yoga, in the form of equanimity i.e., without being affected, by -
favourable and the unfavourable circumstances, he should make . :
their right use. In favourable circumstances he should, serve the .
world, and in unfavourable circumstances -he should renounce, |
desire for favourable circumstances. __ : .

Appendix—Only the man ridden with desire gets deluded
viz., paves the way to birth and death. The man, who knows the
bright and the dark paths, being selfless, does not pave the way
to birth and death viz., he does not pass by the dark path. —

In the seventh verse of this chapter the Lord declared—
‘tasmatsarvesu kalesu mamanusmara yudhya ca’ and here He
declares—‘tasmatsarvesu kalesu yogayukto bhavarjuna’—it
means that thinking (remembrance) of God viz., to worship
God is ‘Yoga’ and to be established in equanimity viz., to be
detached from the world, is also Yoga. Both have the same result.

The Yogi, who knows this secret, transcends the fruits of

Comment:—- : :

'Vedesu yajiiesu tapahsu caiva danesu yatpunyaphalath .
pradistam atyeti tatsarvamidam viditva yogi param sthanamupaiti
cadyam'—The fruit of performing meritorious acts, such as
austerities, sacrifices, penances, charities and pilgrimages
etc., is perishable, because all those acts have a beginning
and an end; so how could their fruit, be imperishable? The
man (soul), because of ignorance gets entangled in perishable
things and persons etc., though, he is an eternal fraction of the
Lord. Thus a striver, who knows the secret of the bright and
the dark paths, described from the twenty-third verse to the
twenty-sixth verse, transcends, the fruits of meritorious deeds,
of the performance of sacrifices, austerities and charities etc.,
because he comes to know that all the worlds of pleasures
from the abode of Brahma downwards are subject to return.

But on attaining, the Lord, there is no rebirth (Gita 8/16). He,
also knows, that he is a fraction of the Lord, and so without
getting entangled in perishable and kaleidoscopic things and
"
1070,"Verse 28] _ SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1033
pleasures, he can take refuge, in Him. Thus, he can attain,
the primeval Abode ‘viz., (God* Who has been called in the
twenty-first verse, of this chapter ‘Supreme Goal’, and ‘Supreme
Abode’. oe i : :

The man, who is engrdssed in pleasure and prosperity, cannot
know, the Supreme priméval Abode viz., God. He himself, is
responsible for this ignorance, because of his disinclination for
God. He can wipe out this ignorance and error. If he renounces,
the desire for sensual pledsure, he can know the supreme primeval
Abode viz., the Lord. Si a striver should make the best possible
efforts, to attain the goal of human life, by renouncing desire, : _
for perishable pleasure: ee -

At the end of thé, sixth chapter, Lord Krsna first, recited
the merits of a Yogi/ and then called upon Arjuna, to be a _
Yogi (6/46), but me He first asked him to be a Yogi, and :
then explained, the merits of a Yogi. -The reason, is that in
the sixth chapter, the context is of the aspirant, who falls -
short of perfection in Yoga. Arjuna, then puts the question,

""He whose mind deviates from Yoga, does not perish?"" In -
response to his question, Lord Krsna answers, ""There is no
fall for him, either here or hereafter. Not only this, even a
seeker of Yoga, transcends the fruit of actions."" Therefore, Lord
Krsna, first tells the merit of a Yogi and then orders Arjuna
to be a Yogi. Here, Arjuna puts the question, ""How are You
to be known, at the time of death, by the self-controlled?” So,
Lord Krsna answers, ""I am attainable by exclusive devotion.""
It means, that when a devotee, having total disinclination for
worldly objects, takes refuge only in Him, He is attained,
by that Yogi easily. So’ Lord Krsna, first orders him to be a
Yogi, and then explains the merit of a Yogi.

Ninth Chapter |
INTRODUCTION
In the seventh chapter, Lord Krsna was unfolding to Arjuna
knowledge (wisdom) with realization (real knowledge of manifest
Divinity). But in between, Arjuna at the beginning of the eighth
chapter, raised seven questions. So Lord Krsna, by answering
the first six questions, in brief, answered, in detail the seventh
question—""How are you to be known at the time of death by
the self-controlled?"" | _
Now, the Lord starts the same topic of Knowledge (Jiiana),
with Realization (Vijnana), in the ninth chapter. . |

To you who is free from the carping spirit I shall now unfold
the most mysterious knowledge (Jiiana), along with realization
(Vijiana) by knowing which, you will be released from evil i.e.,
the evil of worldly birth and death. 1 ’

1093,"1038 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter9
wants to unfold. To state its merit, He has used the superlative
form, of the adjective—'Guhyatamam’' (most profound). It means,
that this knowledge combined with realization, is most profound.
It has been called, a 'sovereign secret', in the second verse, and -
'the greatest secret’, in the sixty-fourth verse of the eighteenth
chapter. | |
Here, in this chapter, first He used the expression 'Guhyatamam’
(the most profound), and later (in 9/34) used 'Manmanabhava'
(fix your mind on Me), while, in the eighteenth chapter, first
He used the expression ‘Sarvaguhyatamam’ (the most secret of
all), and then (in 18/65) said 'Manmanabhava' (fix your mind .
on Me). It means, that the same topic has been explained here,
as well as, there. : |
- This most profound secret cannot be disclosed to all, because -
the Lord has described His own merit, in it. One who possesses
a critical spirit, in the least, can take the contrary meaning, that |
Lord Krsna, is boasting of His own merits. The Lord wants to -
say to Arjuna, that he is devoid of a carping spirit. So He, will
unfold the most profound knowledge, along with realization to -
him viz., He will explain the ""Tattva’ and also the methods for
its realization. _ | : | :
Secondly, He means to say, that every human being 1s eligible
to take refuge in Him. Even the vilest sinner, belonging to any
caste, creed, country and colour, deserves to seek refuge, in
Him. So, by taking refuge in Him, he can attain Him. Hence
He wants to disclose this secret.
The Lord uses the term ‘Tu’ (indeed), as He could not say, in
the seventh chapter, all that He wanted to say. So, He declares,
that He will amplify the same topic again.
‘Jianam vijhanasahitam'—The belief, that the Lord 1s the
root of the universe, is ‘Jnana’ (Knowledge), and the realization
that in the universe, there is nothing besides the Lord is 'Vijiana’ :
(real knowledge of manifest Divinity). In the first half, of the
"
1094,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI | 1039

preceding verse, the Lord has eulogized 'Knowledge along with

Realization’, by the terms ‘Tdam’ and 'Guhyatamam’. |

~ ““By having this knowledge, combined with realization, -you

will be freed from evil. This knowledge is a sovereign science, - ,

and a: sovereign secret etc. Men, devoid of faith in this Dharma -

(Duty), revolve in the path of the mortal world"" (9/1—3).. By

saying so the Lord explained ‘Knowledge’. ""Ali this universe is

pervaded, by Me in My unmanifest form ie., in this universe,

there is nothing else besides Me"" (9/4—6). By saying so He

explained ""Vijnana’.. | | - : —— -
""All beings compelled by their own nature go into My

Prakrti (the prime cause), at dissolution and at the beginning :

of creation, I bring them forth again. But these actions, do not -

bind Me. With Me as a supervisor, nature brings forth, the whole

creation. Fools, not knowing My supreme nature, think low. of

Me. Senseless persons with vain hopes, vain actions and vain -

knowledge, have embraced a nature, which is fiendish, demoniacal

and delusive. Great souls, possessing divine nature, knowing -

Me as imperishable and prime cause of creation, worship Me

constantly, with an undivided mind. Others, through their offering

of knowledge, worship Me as their very self etc."" (9/7-—15).

By saying so, the Lord explained the term ‘Knowledge’. ""I am

a Vedic ritual, I am sacrifice, I am an offering to the departed

(ancestors), I am a medicinal herb etc., and I am, a being as well

as, non-being, i.e., I am tverything” (9/16—19). By saying—

so He explained, 'Vijfiana’. ""Those who worship Me through

sacrifice, to seek access to heaven, having enjoyed the vast world

of heaven, return to the world of mortals, on the exhaustion of

their merit. To those, who worship Me with exclusive devotion,

I attend to their needs and preserve what is already possessed,

by them. These devotees, who endowed with faith, worship other

gods, worship Me ignorantly. Those who do not know Me, ‘as
"
1095,"1040 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 9
the Enjoyer and Lord of all sacrifices, fall. Those who offer Me
with devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit or even water etc.,. and all
their actions, are freed from the bondage of actions"" (9/20-—28). _
By saying so, He explained, ‘Knowledge’. ""I am equally present
in all beings; there is none hateful or dear, to Me. But, those
who worship Me with devotion, are in Me and I am in them""
(9/29). By saying so, He explained, 'Vijnana’. In the next five |
verses (from 9/30—34) 'Vijnana’ has further been explained.*
| ""Yajjiiatva moksyasesubhat'—Affinity with unreal, is an evil
which is the cause of birth in good and evil wombs. This affinity,
is not natural and real, itis merely assumed, by error. So, a man
can be liberated from this assumed affinity, by not strengthening
it. Actually man (soul) is an eternal fraction of the Lord, but
assumes its affinity of ‘I'ness and 'Mineness', with the body and .
the world, and thus dies and is, reborn. When he realizes reality
or he is inclined towards God, then he is released from the evil
of worldly, birth and death. : : : -
Appendix—The world is manifest. Karmayoga (performance
of action in a disinterested manner) being unmanifest is secret. -
Being more secret than Karmayoga, Jiianayoga (knowledge of
the self) is more secret. Being more secret than even Jiianayoga,
Bhaktiyoga is the most secret. The secret (guhya) and the more |
secret (guhyatara) are worldly but the most secret (guhyatama)
is unworldly. | | |
All worlds, from the abode of Brahma downwards, being
subject to rebirth, are evils (Gita 8/16). Having known the
most profound topic, a man is totally liberated from the evil of
worldly birth and death. A man is liberated from this evil by
Karmayoga and Jiianayoga also but here liberation from the evil |
means—there should not be any other entity in the least besides |
God and there should not remain even the subtle iota (trace) of

""Rajavidya'—This knowledge with Realization, is a sovereign
science, after knowing which, nothing remains to be known.
. At the beginning of the seventh chapter, Lord Krsna said,
“After knowing My entire form, nothing else remains to be
known."" He declared at the end of the fifteenth chapter, ""The
undeluded person who knows Me, beyond perishable Matter and
superior to the imperishable soul, knows all i.e., nothing else
remains to be known to him."" |
So it seems that greater importance has been attached to the
Lord Who is endowed with attributes and form in comparison
to other forms whether manifest or unmanifest, attributeless or
with attributes. : : OO
_ 'Rajaguhyam'—This is a sovereign secret, because in. the
"
1097,"1042 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 9 |
world there is nothing more secret, than this. |. ee
As an actor, in a play conceals his original identity, similarly,
the Lord is not manifest to all (Gita 7/25), because men devoid _ |
of devotion have a critical spirit. But, He becomes manifest
to His loving devotees. To disclose his identity is something
very secret. oo | ;
'‘Pavitramidam'—This science is supremely holy and is a |
purifier. By this science, even the vilest sinner becomes instantly
virtuous viz., holy and secures, lasting peace (9/31).
In the tenth chapter, Arjuna addressed Lord Krsna, as the
greatest purifier (10/12); in the fourth. chapter, Lord Krsna declared, .
that in the world there is no purifier like knowledge (4/38), and
here He declares Knowledge with Realization, (by using eight
adjectives) as a purifier. It means, that the Lord and His name, -
form, sport, place, thought, utterance, loud-chanting, meditation
and knowledge etc., are holy and purify i.e., everything of the
Lord is a great purifier, which purifies all beings. -
'Uttamam'—This science, is super-excellent,. because it makes
My devotees, the most noble. One becomes so noble, that I obey -
him. About those devotees, the Lord declares, ""They abide in
Me and I abide in them"" (9/29) i.e., by being absorbed in Me,
they become.one, with Me. | ; |
'Pratyaksavagamam'—lIt is directly realizable. The more one
knows it, the more uncommon, he becomes. As soon as, he knows
it, he secures lasting peace. Thus it is directly realizable.
‘Dharmyam'—It is virtuous. All the actions performed,
for God-realization without a desire for fruit, are included in
virtuous actions. 7
In the second chapter, Lord Krsna said to Arjuna, ""There
is nothing more welcome for a man of the warrior class, than
a righteous war"" (2/31). It means, that all actions performed
according to one's caste and stage (order) of life, sanctioned by -
scriptures, are virtuous. Besides these, all the means for God-
"
1098,"Verse 2]... . |. SADHAKA-SANIIVANI. 1043
realization and all divine traits, have also been called immortal
Dharma (Righteousness), (Gita 12/20). . a
: ‘Avyayam'—It is imperishable. The Lord has also said, that -
His devotee never perishes (9/31).
'‘Karturh susukham'—It is very easy to practise. How easy
it is to offer a leaf, a flower, a fruit or water etc., to God, by
regarding them as His (9/26)! If a devotee offers somethings to |
God, thinking these as his own, the Lord reciprocates them, an
infinite times, more. But, if he offers them, to Him regarding
them as His, He offers Himself to him. How easy it is! By doing
so, He has only to rectify his error. |
The Lord, is easily attainable, because He pervades everywhere,
every time, in all the persons and things etc. Whatever is seen,
heard and grasped therein, He pervades. All men are His, and -
He is theirs. But, they without realizing this real affinity attach
importance to Matter and thus follow, a cycle of birth and death. If
they pay a little attention to Him, they will perceive a singularity -
in Him, and will realize that they have no affinity with nature,
but they have very innate relationship, with God. a ;
Appendix—Karmayoga and Jfianayoga is ‘raja-vidya’
(sovereign science) and Bhaktiyoga is ‘raja-guhya’ (sovereign
secret). In the fourth and fifth verses of this chapter ‘raja-vidya’
and in the thirty-fourth verse ‘raja-guhya’ has been specially
mentioned. , | |
‘Pratyaksavagamam’—It bears direct fruit. Peace is attained by
Karmayoga, salvation is attained by Jiianayoga and love (devotion)
is directly attained by Bhaktiyoga. By taking refuge in God,
a man directly becomes free from fears, sorrows, worries and
doubts. ‘The realization of the self which is truth, consciousness
is also direct. ‘Dharmyam’—It is not devoid of virtues, but it is
virtuous, it is imbued with virtues. Having known it, the human
life becomes successful viz., nothing remains to be done, nothing
remains to the known and nothing remains to be attained.
"
1099,"1044 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 9 |
‘Susukharh kartum’—It is very easy to practise because
God is naturally attained. All is God— it needs no labour, it
is mere acceptance. From the view point of Karmayoga, if the -
things, which are not ours but which are of others, are used is
rendering service to others, what force is needed in. it! From
the view point of Jiianayoga, if we get established in the self,
what force is needed! From the view point of Bhaktiyoga, if we a
surrender ourselves to God, what force is required! All these
disciplines culminate easily. |

aprapya mam nivartante mrtyusamsaravartmani
People devoid. of faith in this Dharma, fail to reach Me, O
oppressor of the foes, and they whirl in the path of the world of
death i.e., they remain caught up in the recurring cycle of births
and deaths. 3
Comment:—
'ASraddadhanah purusa dharmasyasya parantapa'— Dharma’, .
is of two types—'Svadharma’' and 'Paradharma’. Ever existent self
is, ‘Svadharma’, and nature and its evolutes, is 'Paradharma’. In the
preceding two verses, the Lord promised to explain Knowledge
with Realization, and eulogized it by assigning eight merits.
This is mentioned here, as Dharma’. People devoid of faith,
are those, who are absorbed in worldly perishable things, by
"
1100,"Verse 3] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI : . 1045
regarding these as real. Oo
What a wonder it is, that men have faith in bodies, families,
wealth and property etc., which are kaleidoscopic and depend,  —
on them! They do not reflect, how long they will remain with
bodies, and how long those bodies will remain, with them. They
should depend on the self, or on God.
'Aprapya mam nivartante mrtyusarnsaravartmani'—The Lord
says that He is present in all climes, times, things and persons and
He is ever attained. Those who have faith in the mundane instead
of attaining Him, whirl in the path of birth and death. If they are
born, they have to die; if they die, they are to be born. To whatever
species, they go, they assume affinity with those species. Actually
their connection with those bodies, is constantly severing. This
affinity, cannot last long. Such people, revolve in the path of the _
mortal world. Even after reaching higher regions, as the abode of
Brahmi etc., they have to return (8/16,25; 9/21). It means, that there |
is rebirth, so long as they do.not attain God. -
The Lord, while using the expression 'Mrtyusarhsaravartmani’,
means that they revolve in the path of the mortal world. In the -
seventh verse of the twelfth chapter, the world has been called,
an ocean of birth and death. . Oo
God by his grace, suspending the fruit of actions, bestows
this human body, so that men may attain salvation. But, by seeing
_ those who, by missing this golden opportunity for salvation,
follow a cycle of birth and death. God pities them and repents
His action because those fools, without attaining Him, descend
into a still lower plane (Gita 16/20). :
‘Aprapya mim'—This expression, shows that a man has got
a right to realize God. In the twentieth verse of the sixteenth
chapter, also Lord Krsna expresses His view that even a demoniac- |
natured man can, attain Him. So the Lord declares, ""Even the
vilest sinner, can become virtuous and secure, lasting peace""
(9/30-31) and ""Even the most sinful of all sinners, can cross all :
"
1101,"1046 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA | [Chapter 9
sins by the raft of Knowledge” (4/36). |
There was a. city, surrounded by high walls, having an
exit. A blind man with the help of a stick, wanted to grope his -
- way out of the city. But, as soon as he neared the exit, he had
an itching sensation. So, he began to scratch his skin, and he
missed the exit, and went ahead. This routine continued, and he
could not go out. Similarly, this soul revolves in heaven, hell :
and eighty-four lac forms of lives, but is unable to be liberated.
So, the Lord by this grace, bestows this human body, so that he
may be freed from the cycle of birth and death. But he suffers
from itch, for pleasure, and by hankering after prosperity and .
pleasures, he dies and follows, the cycle of birth and death.
This soul is an eternal fraction of the Lord, and He is its |
real, abode. So, after attaining Him, there is no return, as has -
been declared in the Gita, time and again: ""One who knows
My birth and activities divine, does not take birth again, but |
- attains Me"" (4/9); ""Those who merge in Him, have no return"" -
(5/17); ""Those who attain the Supreme Abode, don't return""
(8/21); “Having reached which, one never returns"" (15/4); _
""Having reached which, men don't return"" (15/6). The Srutis,
also declare the same. , Oe
Generally, people think that they are worldly, and so birth
and death, is a natural process. But, it is perfectly wrong. A man
is a fraction of God, and so he belongs to God's Abode. He is
eternal and sentient, while the world is kaleidoscopic, perishable
and insentient. So, he has no real affinity with the world, but he
has assumed his affinity with it. The bodies, come back, again
and again (8/19) while his self remains, the same.
He can never, have union, with the world and disunion from
God. He may go to heaven, hell, eighty-four lac forms of lives, _
or through a human life, he cannot be separate, from God. But,
"
1102,"Verse 3] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 1047
in other births, besides the human birth, he cannot recognize God,
because his discrimination is not aroused. In this human life, -he
has got an opportunity to recognize Him, because He by. His -
grace has bestowed upon him the power of discrimination, that
he could recognize Him and attain Him. But it is very surprising
and indeed shocking, that he instead of attaining Him, circulates,
in the path of the mortal world. oe
We have come to this human world, to attain salvation.
But, we get attached to bodies, families, wealth, property etc.,
which are not ours, and forget that we belong to God, and
to His Abode. So, we think, that it is very difficult, to attain :
Him. The fact is, that it is very easy to attain Him, because He
pervades everytime, everywhere, all things, men, incidents and
circumstances etc., and all are, in Him. So, we are ever with -
Him and He is ever. with us. We cannot be separate, from Him
and He cannot be separate, from us. - |
It means, that we do not belong to this mortal world, and -
this mortal world (including men, things, bodies etc.,) does not
belong to us. We are only God's, and only God is, ours. —
_  Appendix—People devoid of faith in the glory of ‘Jiiana’
with ‘Vijfiana’ mentioned in the preceding verse, don’t derive |
benefit from it but remain engrossed in perishable pleasures by
attaching importance to them. Therefore they, instead of attaining
God, follow the cycle of birth and death; having renounced the
natural path of immortality, whirl in the path of death. :
The expression ‘aprapya mam’ means ‘that in human body
there was an opportunity to attain God. The man was in close
vicinity to God-realization but devoid of faith, he, instead ‘of
attaining God, goes on whirling in the world. He instead of
believing the ever present entity, believes in the unreal which
does not stay even for a moment. His heart is so impure that
he, having perceived the direct influence of God, has-no faith in
Him. As having perceived the direct benefit in the association
"
1103,"1048 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 9
with the good and in loud chanting of the holy names of God
etc., he is not specially engaged in them. At the sudden death of |
some near and dear one or in any other sudden sad occurrence,
| he develops temporary dispassion but does not remain constant -
in it. On 21st September, 1995 in the entire world the idols of
Lord Ganega drank milk and the people saw this incident with
their own eyes. But several people who regard themselves as
intelligent (wise) didn’t believe in this incident and contradicted
it by the medium of newspapers and T.V. etc. In the assembly
of Kauravas when Duhéasana made an effort to make Draupadi
- naked by pulling her Sari, by God’s grace there was a heap
of Saris and Duhédsana’s all efforts failed. Having seen such
a miracle before their own eyes,, the Kauravas didn’t come to
their senses. Therefore those whose intellect is Tamasika (of
the nature of ignorance) and impure, they are not influenced _
by such unique incidents. They don’t believe in such incidents.
They see all things perverted (Gita 18/32). Such people devoid
of faith, by renouncing the path of immortality, follow the path -
of death in which there is nothing but death. They follow the
path by which they may never attain God. | an -
By being attached to apara, a man whirls in the path of
death. If he, instead of being attached to apara, is attached to
God, the master of that apara, he will be liberated from the
wheel of birth and death forever. A man can be liberated in
this: life and can even attain God’s love (devotion) which is
far superior to salvation. But having possessed such a high
qualification, eligibility and competence, he follows the path
of death. Therefore the Lord with pity utters—‘aprapya mam
nivartante mrtyusarhsaravartmani’ and ‘mamaprapyaiva kaunteya
tato yantyadhamash gatirh’ (Gita 16/20). It proves that now there
is the golden opportunity to attain salvation. If a man himself is
engaged in attaining salvation, then dharma, the scriptures, the
exalted souls, the world and God—all help him.

| ""Maya tatamidam sarvarh jagadavyaktamirtina'—The Lord's -
manifest form (Sakara) is that which is perceived by mind, intellect
and. senses, while His unmanifest form (Nirakara) is that, which
is not known by mind, intellect and senses. Here, the Lord by the
term ""Maya'.(by Me), has explained His manifest form, while by
‘Avyaktamiirtina’, His unmanifest form. It means, that He exists,
in both the forms. The. Lord, here wants to express the forms in
entirety. The difference in His forms; is according to sects and
creeds. In fact He is the same, though He is called by different
names and attributes. | a. —
_ _In the Gita, wherever there is a description of the real and
the unreal, for the real (soul) it is mentioned ""By which all this is
pervaded"" (2/17) because, being a portion of the Lord, like Him,
it pervades everything. Where, there is description of worship,
of the Lord endowed with attributes and formless, there it is |
"
1105,"1050 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter9
mentioned as ""By whom all this is pervaded"" (8/22). Where, there
is description of worship, of the Lord through performance of
duty, there also, it is mentioned, ""By whom all this is pervaded""
(18/46). For making synchronous adjustment with these statements, -
He declares, ""All this universe, is pervaded by Me.""
-""Matsthani sarvabhitani'—All beings abide, in Me i.e., all
this universe in the form of higher and lower nature, abides :
in Me because all emanate, from Me, abide in Me and also
merge, in Me. : : - a
'Na caham tesvavasthitah'—Now the -Lord, makes a
contradictory statement, by saying that, He does not abide in
them. The reason is; that .if He had abode in them, with their
decay and death, He would also have decayed and died. But it is _
not so, because the worldly bodies and things are kaleidoscopic
and perishable, while in Him, there is not even the slightest -
modification. He remains detached, from them, established, . in :
His Own Self. : Oo _
When He declares, that He abides in them, He means that
they seem to exist, because of His existence. . : | -
""Na ca matsthani bhitani'*—He again declares, that the beings
do not dwell, in Him. The reason is, that if the beings had dwelt
in Him, like Him they would not have undergone any change
in them, and they would not have perished. It proves, that they
do not dweliin Him.  —s>— BF oo
Now, the contradictory statements are further explained; by
means of an illustration. The Lord, abides in the world and the
world abides in the Lord; the Lord does not abide in the world,
and the world does not abide in the Lord. Waves, are in water —
and water is in waves, but waves have no existence of their
own, besides water. Similarly, the world has no existence of its
own, besides the Lord, because like waves, the world (beings)
* Tt may also mean that beings don't accept that they are established in God,
they accept them to be established in Nature so they are not established in him.
"
1106,"Verse 4-5] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI  — 1051
emanates, from the Lord, dwells in Him and merges in Him. Thus |
the Lord abides in the world, and the world abides in the Lord.
_ But, if we do not accept the independent existence of waves, -
because they have no existence, besides water, there is neither
water in waves, nor waves in water, there remains only water,
which appears as waves. Similarly, neither God abides in the world,
- nor does the world abide in God; the world has no existence of
its own, besides the Lord, ""All this is God"" (7/19).
All the earthenware vessels, are of nothing, besides clay.
So, there is clay in these and they are in clay. But actually, it
is not so. If there had been clay in earthenware vessels, with :
the destruction of the earthenware vessels, clay would have been
destroyed. But it is not so. Similarly, if earthenware vessels, had
been in clay, they would remain safe forever, like clay. But it is
not so. It means, that earthenware vessels, are not in clay.Inthe _ -
same way, neither God dwells in the world, nor does the world
dwell, in God. If God dwelt in the world, He would die, with _
the death of the world. But, He does not die. It means, that He
does not dwell in the world. He is established in His own self. ;
Similarly if the world dwelt in God, the world would continue
to exist, with the existence of God. But as the world perishes,
so the world does not dwell, in God. oo
When a man, from a distance thinks of the Ganges and its |
bank, at Haridvara, he forms an image of the scene, of devotees _
bathing, fish jumping and the clock tower etc., but actually these
do not exist there. Similarly, this world, is a manifestation of the
Lord's, pursuit of mind. But, when He renounces this pursuit of
mind, there is no world, there is only God. a
Thus, if we accept the existence, of the world, God dwells
in the world and the world dwells, i God. But if we realize
reality, there is neither God, in the world nor is the world, in
God, there is only God. This is:the view, of liberated souls and >
perfect devotees. sj oe :

Lord, is the creator and the sustainer of all beings, but He does .
not dwell in them i.e., He does not depend on them, and is not
attached to them. The same fact, has been pointed out by Him, in
the seventeenth verse of the fifteenth chapter, when he declares, -
""The Supreme Person, is distinct from both the perishable (world)
and the imperishable (soul), He is called the Supreme Soul and
He pervades and sustains, the three worlds."" -
He means, that as He in spite of being the creator and
sustainer of the world, remains detached, free from egoism and -
excessive fondness, a striver, should bring up his family and
manage other affairs, by remaining free from attachment, without
I, mine and egoism etc. A striver, should behold the world, as
Lord's manifestation and its affairs, as the sport of the Lord, and
should ever remain satisfied, and pleased.
If a striver, tries to understand, he can realize, ‘All this is
God.' The criterion is, that he remains equanimous, in favourable

Appendix— ‘Maya tatamidarh sarvam’——this expression means
that as in snow there is only water, similarly God alone pervades
the entire universe as equanimous, quiet, truth-knowledge-bliss |
solidified. The world which is perishing every moment, has no :
independent existence. The world which seems to exist out of
ignorance, is also because of the existence of God. When there
Is one indivisible existence (Is) in all forms, then how can there ~
be four divisions as ‘I’, ‘you’ (thou), ‘this’ and ‘that’? How can ,
there be egoism and mineness? How can practice be done to
wipe out the unreal which has no existence? -
The Lord has used the expression ‘na ca matsthani bhutani’
for ‘matsthani sarvabhiitani’ and He has used the expression -
‘na caharh tesvavasthitah’ for ‘maya tatamidarh sarvarh jagadavya-
ktamurtina’. So long as a striver holds that God and the world are 7
two or different from each other, he should understand that there
is the world in God and God is in the world (Gita 6/30). But
when he holds that there is only one entity instead of two, then |
there is neither the world in God nor is God in the world.
The man himself has accepted the independent existence
of the world—‘yayedarn dharyate jagat’ (Gita 7/5). The world
seems to have independent existence because of egoistic notion,
the sense of mine and desire. Therefore so long as a striver has
egoism, mineness and desire, there is the world in God and God
is in the world. But when egoism, the sense of mine and desire
are wiped out, then from the view-point of a God-realized soul,

neither there is the world in God nor is God in the world viz., o

In Srimadbhagavata it is mentioned that so long as a striver
holds that there is independent existence of the world, he should
worship God ‘by regarding the beings as the manifestation of
God by his dealings.* But when from. his view-point, the world
does not exist any more, only God remains, then he should be
indifferent even to the thought—‘all is God’.t ‘Bhitabhrnna

the whole creation—‘aharh sarvasya prabhavah’ (Gita 10/8),
‘aharn krtsnasya jagatah: prabhavah’ (Gita 7/6). God. also
sustains these beings—‘yo lokatrayamavisya bibhartyavyaya -
igvarah’ (Gita 15/17). Though God is the origin of all beings and
also sustains them, yet He does not get tainted, is not attached
to them and does not depend on them. As God does not abide :
in those beings, therefore by being attached to those beings and ,
objects, God is not attained. Do | ) ~
In fact there is no entity of matter besides the divine entity

mighty wind, moving everywhere, éver rests in ether, as breeze,
air or wind, similarly, all beings animate or inanimate, revolving -
in the three worlds, and fourteen spheres, dwell in the Lord.
The Lord, has used the term, 'Matsthani', from the fourth
verse to the sixth verse, three times. It means, that all the beings .
rest in Him, they cannot be separated from Him, even though
they accept their affinity with matter: (nature) and its evolutes,
and bodies etc. - ae
Just as, wind is born of ether, remains in ether, and merges ©
in ether, man (soul) emanates, from the Lord, dwells in Him,
and merges into Him. When wind merges in ether, it has no
existence of its own, only -ether remains. Similarly when the
soul merges, into the Lord, only He remains. | :
Unlike wind, this soul, does not move everywhere. But, when
it accepts its affinity of 'I'ness and 'Mineness' with this body,
"
1111,"1056 , SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter9
the movement of the body seems to. it as its own: movement,
though it always rests.in the Lord. Therefore, the Lord, in the
twenty-fourth verse of the. second chapter, has declared the
soul to be eternal, omnipresent, immovable, constant and _ever- -
| lasting. Here. it has been called ‘all-pervading’, because of the
movement of the body, otherwise it is immovable and constant.
So, the Lord declares, that all beings, rest in Him immovably 7
and constantly. So So
It means, that beings of all the world, have no independent
existence of their own, they ever rest, in the Lord. But, they
do not realize this fact: because they assume their affinity, with
the body. If they renounce this assumed affinity of 'Tness and
‘Mineness' with the body, they can secure infinite bliss. So, the
Lord by warning human beings, declares that they ever rest in
Him, so no labour or time is required, to attain Him. The only :
obstacle is, that they do not realize the fact. :
‘Iti upadharaya'—A striver, should know the fact, that all -
beings totally rest in Him. By knowing this fact, he will have
a disinclination for the world, and then realize Him. To realize -
Him, a striver should assume, with determination, that the Lord,
Who pervades everywhere, in all the things and persons etc., is
his, and he is His, while neither things and men etc., are his,
nor he is theirs. ee
All beings rest, in the Lord. But, the bodies are born, they live
and die, because, they are transitory, while the soul undergoes,
no change. This soul, has its identity with God, but when it
assumes, its identity with the body, by having a disinclination.
for God, it becomes conscious of its: separate entity, as 'I am
a body’. This 'I'ness consists of two fragments—the self, and
non-self, or it is called the embodied soul. In this ‘T'ness;. the
fragment of non-self, is naturally attracted towards nature. Having
"
1112,"Verse’6] _: SADHAKA-SANJIVANT | 1057
identity with, a fragment of nature, the embodied soul, mistakes
this attraction of nature towards: Nature, as its own and -thinks; ‘T
should get riches, pleasures and worldly enjoyments.' Thus, he -
has disinclination towards God, to a great extent. It accepts the
body's death, as its own. Actually this soul, is an eternal portion
of the Lord, but by having affinity with the world, it wants
to enjoy worldly pleasures, and to maintain the body forever.
Actually, this desire is to remain with God forever because, he
has his real affinity, with Him. However he (embodied soul) may
identify himself, with the body, yet his affinity and attraction
towards God, can neither vanish nor is there is any possibility .
of their vanishing. ‘I should ever live; I should ever be happy;
I should attain supreme joy'—in this form, attraction for God,
subsists in him. But he commits a blunder, that he wants to
attain this supreme joy, through worldly objects. By an error, he
has a desire for pleasure, which are transitory. If he realizes the
reality, that all worldly pleasures are perishable, and sources of -
pain, then his desire for them perishes, and his desire to attain
eternal bliss is aroused. The more this desire, (want) is aroused, ;
the more disinclination, a striver has for perishable objects etc.
When he has a total disinclination, for them, he realizes that he
has rested in the Lord, since time immemorial.

Appendix—As the wind is born of ether, stays in ether and
merges into ether viz., the wind has no independent existence
besides ether, similarly all beings are born of God, abide in God
and merge into God viz., beings have no independent existence
besides God—if a striver accepts this fact firmly, he will realize
the reality—‘all is God’. .

In order to understand this verse the idea of cause and
effect is more apt than ‘Vivartavada’. ‘Vivartavada’ means
Opposite appearance. The thing which actually does not exist
but seems to exist, as the appearance of a snake in a rope—this
is Vivartavada. In Vivartavada two entities are necessary; as the
"
1113,"1058 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 9
rope. and the snake which appears—both are separate entities.
(one real and the other merely appearance). But in this. verse
_ there is the example of ether and the wind (air), both have the
same entity. It means that just like the snake in the rope, the -
wind in ether is not merely an appearance but air is the effect
of ether. The effect has its‘identification with the causé viz., the
effect and the cause—both have one entity,as gold and omaments .
(effect) made of gold are the same. As gold and omnaments—in
both there is only gold, similarly God and all beings—in both
there is only God. This idea has been mentioned in the Gita by
the expressions “Vasudevah sarvam’ (7/19) and ‘sadasaccaham’ .
(9/19) which is the chief principle of the Gité. Vivartavada is
not a principle but is a means to be free from the wrong notion
of regarding the world as real (existent). :

If there is pulsation (movement) in air, then there is air in -
ether and ether is in air. If there is no pulsation in air, there is
neither air in ether nor ether in air viz., there is only ether. In -
other words, so long as there is assumption of the independent
existence of air, there is air in ether and ether in air. But if we
see from the realistic point of view, there is neither air in ether -
nor .ether in air viz., there is only ether. Similarly from. the
realistic point of view, there are neither beings in God nor God
in beings, only God exists viz., all is God (Gita 9/4-5).

| In this verse for air (wind) two adjectives ‘sarvatragah’
and ‘mahan’ have been used. By this it should be understood
that the soul also from the worldly point of view (because of
attachment with Prakrti) is “sarvatragah’ as.it wanders in eighty- |
four lac wombs, three worlds and fourteen spheres. The term
‘mahan’ should mean the beings (group of beings) of infinite
universes. As wind always stays in the sky viz., wind has its
eternal relationship with ether, similarly the beings have their
eternal relation (eternal union) with God.

All beings, are God's fragments, and ever rest in Him. But, they |
identify themselves with Nature and its evolutes, body etc., by -
having an affinity of ‘I'ness and 'Mineness'. So, these are born
and die, again and again. At the time of final dissolution, when
Brahma, the creator's life period of a hundred years, is over, the ;
entire creation goes into an unmanifest state, with their actions.
‘Punastani kalpadau visrjamyaham'—When actions. of those
beings, become mature, to bear fruit, the Lord has His pursuit
of mind, to become manifold from, one. This, is the beginning _
of a new creation. It has been mentioned, in the third verse
of the eighth chapter, as follows—""This resolve, which brings
forth the existence of beings, is called Adikarma (Action).” In
the fourteenth chapter, it is mentioned ""I place the seed"" (14/3)
and ""I am the seed-giving, Father"" (14/4). | .
It means, that at the beginning of a new creation, when Brahma
emanates from the Lord, the Lord according to the. actions of
the beings, brings them forth, again. The Lord declares, it in the
thirteenth verse of the fourth chapter, ""The fourfold caste was
"
1115,"1060 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter9  -
created. by Me, according to their qualities and actions.""

Brahma's day is called a 'Kalpa’, which extends for a thousand
fourfold Yugas (ages). His night, is also of the same duration. -
Brahma, lives for a hundred years. When Brahma’s, life period
is over, he merges into the Lord, which. is called the end of a |
Kalpa, and when he emanates from the Lord, that is the beginning
of a new Kalpa. a es |

Here, it is mentioned that all beings go into His prakrti, at
the end of a Kalpa, but He generates them again at the beginning,
of the next Kalpa. It means, that prakrti being active, when it
gets tired, merges into God itself, and beings having affinity with :
prakrti also merge in it at the time of final dissolution. But at
the time of a new creation, the Lord brings forth those beings,
who had affinity with prakrti again, by giving them the fruit of -
their mature actions, in order to, purify them. As a person, builds
a house, but it slowly gets destroyed by itself whole, the Lord
brings forth beings, but they die themselves. In the same way, -
a man (soul) being a portion of the Lord, has natural inclination
for the Lord, but he has a fall himself, by having desires and -

__ attachment for the perishable body, and world. So, a striver by
attaching importance to discrimination, by renouncing desires
and attachment, should be inclined, towards the Lord.

Appendix—In the entire universe there are three important
factors—origin, state of existence ‘and dissolution. A striver has
an eye only on the state of existence of the world, so the Lord
in the preceding verse having described the existence, now in
this verse mentions the origin, and dissolution. It means thaf the
origin, existence and dissolution—all the three spring from the
entire form of God. |

In fact there is no state of existence of the world but the flow
of its origin and dissolution is said to be the state of existence.

If we perceive from the real point of view we find that there is
not even the origin of the universe, but there is only dissolution
"
1116,"Verse 8] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1061 -
viz., it has no existence. Therefore in the world dissolution,
non-existence or disunion is only predominant—‘nasato vidyate

Comment:— 7
‘Bhitagramamimarh krtsnamavasam prakrtervasat'—Here, the -
term 'prakrti’, stands for individual prakrti. At final dissolution, all
beings merge in individual Nature (causal bodies) and individual
Nature merges into Cosmic Nature and Cosmic Nature, merges _
into the Lord. But, at the beginning of a creation when actions
of those beings become mature to bear fruit, the Lord, thinks to |
become manifold from one. So, there 1s commotion in nature. 7
When curd is churned, butter and butter-milk become separate.
Out of this, butter flows over butter-milk. Here, butter is sattvika,
butter-milk is tamas and the action of churning is, Rajas. Similarly,
from the commotion in prakrti (Nature), also the three attributes
(qualities)—goodness, activity (passion) and inertia (ignorance),
are born. Out of the three modes, the heaven, this mortal world
and the underworld, are born. In these three worlds, beings are
born according to their actions, and nature. This description,
is also given in the third and fourth verses of the fourteenth
chapter. Where ‘prakrti' has been called 'Mahadbrahma’, and 'the
Lord's pursuit of mind to become manifold’ has been declared,
as 'placing the seed of all life.’ |
At dissolution the soul submerges into God, but it does not
"
1117,"1062 §RIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 9

attain emancipation, because it submerges being associated with

modes of nature. Had it renounced its association with modes, it

might have emancipated forever, and would not have undergone,

the. wheel of birth and death. .- : -
Attachment to these modes, is the cause of beings’ birth, in

good and evil bodies. So, a being remains. under its control. In

the nineteenth verse of the eighth chapter, there is a description :

of a being who remains under the control of his own individual

nature. In the fifth verse of the third chapter, there is description

of helplessness, under one's nature after birth. A being, is tied

by these Nature-born modes, in all the three worlds, as is also |

described in the fifth verse of the fourteenth chapter. |
'‘Prakrtim svamavastabhya'—Prakrti (Nature) is an uncommon

power of the Lord, which can neither be called different from

Him, nor one with Him. The Lord, as its supervisor, keeping -

Nature under control, brings forth beings, at the beginning of

creation, because all changes take place in nature, not in the -

Lord. It does not mean, that God Himself is incapable, dependent

and weak, todo so.
As a man, performs actions by controlling his mind and :

senses etc. (But when he comes under the sway of mind and

senses etc., he instead of being their master becomes, a slave

to them), the Lord brings forth beings, by keeping Nature under

control, without getting entangled in her. |
'Visrjami punah punah'—The Lord, brings forth, this whole

multitude of beings in different moving and unmoving species,

and different bodies. In physical bodies of some of the species,

there is preponderance of the earth element, in some, of fire

element, in some of the air element. Thus, the Lord creates

many forms, of bodies.

_ Here, one point needs to be understood. The Lord, brings
forth only those beings, who have become slaves to their nature,
by having the affinity, of ‘I’ and ‘mine’, with personal nature
"
1118,"Verse. 9] -SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1063 .
(body). On being a slave, to his personal nature, one becomes
a slave to the Cosmic Nature. In case, he is not a slave to such
Nature, he is not reborn at the cosmic dawn.
Appendix—In reality Prakrti is not different from God. -
Therefore God in His integral form comprises Prakrti. To regard
God without Prakrti is to have unipresent view of God and it
is not possible. —
‘Avasgam prakrtervasat’—Para prakrti viz., the self is totally _
independent (established in the self). By being connected with the
alien Apara Prakrti, the self has become. dependent (established
in prakrti), otherwise it can never be dependent. Attachment
to the modes is its dependence—‘karanam gunasango’sya -
sadasadyonijanmasu’ (Gita 13/21).
God creates only those beings again and again who are under
the sway of prakrti (their individual nature). Those who are not -
under the control of prakrti (nature) are not created (born)—

"

whole multitude of beings, because He remains like one unattached
and indifferent. He is not happy at creation and sad, at dissolution.
Why has the Lord said, that He remains like one unattached and
indifferent? The term ‘like’ has been used because, God knows -
the fact that actions etc., have no existence of their own besides
Him, so how can He remain unconcerned and unattached to His
own self? One remains unconcerned and indifferent to a thing
only when he accepts its independent existence otherwise he is
like unconcerned and indifferent. |

""Na ca maz tani .karmani nibadhnanti'—In the preceding
verse, the Lord declared, ""I bring forth beings, repeatedly. Such
activities have been termed here, as 'Tani karmani' (those actions). :
The Lord is not bound by the actions because, He has not the
least affinity, with actions and their fruit. The Lord, by saying
so, advises human beings, that they will also not be bound by ~
actions, if they perform these, without attachment for them and
their fruit. Otherwise, they would be bound and must follow, -
the wheel of birth and death. How surprising it is, that a man
gets himself bound by having affinity with those actions, and
their fruits, things and men etc., that perish! Mundane objects -
perish but affinity with them, persists. Men die, but affinity with
objects remains."" How foolish of man!

Appendix—-A man is bound by actions (karmana badhyate
jantuh)—from this worldly point of view the Lord declares that
He is not bound by actions (Gita 4/14); because He is neither
attached to actions nor to the fruit of actions nor He has the
sense of doership. But if we perceive the reality, actions have
no independent existence at all. The action in the form of the
creation of the world is only God’s manifestation—‘te brahma
tadviduh krtsnamadhyatmam karma cakhilam’ (Gita 7/29),
‘bhutabhavodbhavakaro visargah karmasaiijiiitah’ (Gita 8/3).
It means whatever 1s being done such as the origin, existence
and dissolution of the universe, is being done only by God and
"

is His manifestation. He who creates and whatever is created,
He who sustains and whatever is sustained, He who destroys
and whatever is destroyed—all these are organs (manifestation)
of only one entire God—‘aharn krtsnasya jagatah: prabhavah -
pralayastatha’ (Gita 7/6). | |

Comment:— ,
""Mayadhyaksena prakrtih siiyate sacaracaram'—The Lord,
animates nature, to bring forth the whole creation. As different
machines, such as refrigerators, heaters, trains, lifts, televisions
and X-rays etc., function with the power of electricity; so,
creation, preservation, destruction and all the mundane activities,
are performed by nature with the power of God, Who animates
Nature but Himself, remains as a supervisor. It means, that as
electric power manifests itself through machines, the Lord's
power, manifests itself, through Nature.
The Lord, is an actionless supervisor, while the world revolves
1.e., the world undergoes changes. These changes, will continue
"
1121,"1066 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 9 -
to occur, so long as, beings have their affinity of ‘ness and
‘Mineness' for Nature, and its evolutes—bodies. Thus they will
go on revolving, in the path of the mortal world. It means, that
without God-realization they cannot rest permanently, anywhere. -
Nature, whirls them, in the path of birth and death (Gita 9/3).
All beings, are established in God, and so God is attainable
to them, but they assume their affinity of ‘I'ness and ‘Mineness' |
with Nature, and so Nature brings them forth and merges them
in her, under the supervision of the Lord. In fact, Nature has
no power to bring them forth and to merge them, because it is
insentient. They cannot die and take birth, because they, being -
a portion of the Lord, are imperishable, sentient and unaltered. 7
But, by assuming their affinity, of ‘T'ness and 'Mineness'’ with
objects and persons born of Nature, they have to take birth, and —
have to die. — -
All actions, of the entire universe, such as creation, preservation
and dissolution are performed by nature, in nature and are of _
nature. But nature, derives the power of action from God, Who
remains actionless. As all actions, approved and disapproved by
scriptures are performed, in the light of the sun, these actions -
result, in favourable and unfavourable circumstances for beings.
But the sun and its light, remain the same, without undergoing
any change; similarly there is a lot of modification in the world,
but the Lord and His portion (i.e.,) soul, remain the same. There
is no change, ever possible in the self (soul). A man thinks, that
there is a change in him but actually there is no change in him.
Change is in his body etc. But this change to him appears in
himself, because he identifies himself with a body and the world.
If he accepts, his true affinity with God (which is natural), his
true love for God, will be spontaneously aroused.
Appendix—Nature brings into being the whole creation, both
animate and inanimate by receiving power from God viz., nature
undergoes all changes, there is no change in God. So long as

Prakrti under the control of God, creates the entire universe -
but the embodied soul being controlled by one’s own prakrti,
whirls in the circle of birth and death. It means that God is
independent, but His fragment, the self becomes dependent |
because of the desire for pleasure. : |
In essence God (the powerful) and prakrti (His power)—both
are one but the Lord in order to explain it to people, declares |
that prakrti plays the predominant role in the creation of the .
universe. In fact neither prakrti nor actions have independent :
existence.
If we perceive God and His prakrti different, then prakrti is
the material cause and God is the instrumental cause; because -
God is not transformed into the world but it is prakrti which
is transformed. But if we perceive God and His prakrtias one —S_—_""
(which really are one), then He alone is the material cause and
as well the instrumental cause. : -
At the beginning of the seventh chapter the Lord described
the nature of para and apara prakrtis and here (at the beginning
of the ninth chapter) He is describing their evolutes (origin, state
of existence and dissolution) which is the Lord’s drama (play)
of human semblance. It means that in the seventh chapter there
is predominantly the description of para and apara and here is |
predominantly the description of the master of para and apara
(God). In this chapter there is elaborate description of the Lord’s
pastime, influence and glory, by which a striver may develop
his love (devotion) for God, lest he may rest content merely at
salvation. -

avajananti mam midha manusim tanumasritam
param bhavamajananto mama bhitamahesvaram
Fools disregard Me on My taking on a human form, not knowing
My supreme nature, as the Great Lord of beings. 11
Comment:—
‘Param bhavamajananto mama bhittamaheévaram'—The Great -
Lord, is He, Who is ruler, patron, director and supervisor of
nature, from Whom, Nature derives power to create, preserve
and destroy, the animate and inanimate beings, and Who is the —
master of the gods, who control their own worlds, to which
different beings go, according to their actions. Without His will,
not even a leaf of a tree moves. This, is His lordliness. This has -
been described here, by the expression, 'Bhitamahesvaram’.
By ‘Pararn bhavam', He means, that fools do not know His -
supreme nature, that He is free, to make any drastic change.
They do not know, that He transcends the perishable Matter, is .
also superior to the imperishable soul, and He, is known as the
Supreme Person, in the Vedas (Gita 15/18). So they ignore Him
by taking Him as an ordinary mortal, in human form.
‘Manusirh tanumasritam'—They, treat the Incarnation of
the Lord, as an ordinary human being. As a common man, by |
identifying himself with the body, thinks that the family, honour or
dishonour, is his own, and gain and loss of property etc., is also, his
own. As common beings, were not manifest before birth and will
not be manifest after death, they are manifest, only in the interim
(2/28), and deluded persons, treat Him as a common man. They
regard Him, as a slave to the human body, like a common man.
"
1124,"Verse 11] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1069 -
The human body of the Lord, is not the fruit of any action.
He incarnates by His own free-will (Srimadbhagavata 10/33/35)
as a fish, a tortoise, or a boar etc., He does not depend on a
body, but the body, an evolute of Nature, depends on Him, -
because He manifests Himself, keeping His Nature under
control (Gita 4/6).
Fools, treating the Lord as an ordinary being, do not seek |
refuge in Him, because they do not know, His divine play, rather,
: they consider Him, as a slave to a body. The same fact, has
been pointed out, in the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth verses of
the seventh chapter, when the Lord declares, ""Not knowing My |
unsurpassable and undecaying supreme state, these ignorant folk, -
do not recognise Me, as the unborn and imperishable Supreme .
Spirit."" So, they instead of taking refuge in the Lord, seek refuge,
in other gods (Gita 7/20). -
‘Avajananti mam* midha'—Fools disregard the Lord, under
Whose supervision Nature brings forth and merges infinite
univetses, Who controls the activities of the universes and Who 7
by His grace has bestowed, this human body. They think, lowly
of Him, by regarding Him, as a common earthbound man, and -
attaching importance to mundane prosperity and pleasure.
Appendix—In this verse the Lord’s glory has been described |
specially. There is no greater lord than God, He is the ‘Supreme’
(superior to all). But the ignorant don’t know Him in His true
nature. They instead of regarding Him as unworldly (superhuman)
regard Him as a worldly common man. |
Some people hold that Lord Krsna was not God, but He
was a yogi. There are eight limbs of Yoga—yama (five great |
vows), niyama (canons of conduct), asana (posture), pranayama
(restraint of breath), pratyahara (withdraw of the senses), dharana
(concentration), dhyana (meditation) and samadhi (trance)
* Here the term 'Mam’' has been used for the same Lord (God) Who has
been described from the fourth verse to the tenth verse of this chapter.
"
1125,"1070 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 9 -

(YogadarSana 2/29). Out of these eight, the first one is Yama. |

Yamas are five—ahirhsa (non-violence), truthfulness, continence,

non-stealing and non-acquisition (Yogadarsana 2/30). Therefore ;

he who is a yogi, will certainly follow “Yamas’ viz., he will

speak the truth only. If he tells a lie he can’t be a yogi because

he has not even observed the first rule “Yama’ of Yoga. In

the Gita Lord Krsna has called Himself several times the Lord

(Isvara).* Therefore if He is a Yogi, then He speaks the truth

and if He speaks the truth, then He is God in full (entirety)—this =

will have to be accepted. | | 7

knowledge, have adopted a nature, which is fiendish, demoniacal |

and delusive. 12

Comment:— |
""Moghasa'—The hopes of those people, who by having a :

disinclination for God, have a desire for pleasure and heaven, are

vain, because it is not a rule that such hopes must be fulfilled. Even,

if these are fulfilled, they perish, after bearing fruit. Therefore,

until a man attains God, all his hopes and desires are in vain,
* “‘Bhutanamisvaro’ pi san’ (4/6), “‘SarvalokamaheSvaram’ (5/29), ‘mattah

because they with their fruit, are perishable (Gita 7/23). _

""Moghakarmano'—The actions of the people, who have a
disinclination for God, are vain, because if they perform actions _
approved by scriptures for their fruit, they with their fruit, will |
perish. Their fruit, would carry the people, to higher regions,
from where, they will have a return. Thus, they waste their time,
energy and intellect in vain, they remain blank, being deprived |
of the real gains of human life. |

It means, that man, being a portion of God, is eternal, while
actions and their fruits, are perishable. So, he will gain nothing
besides pain and disquietude by performing actions for their fruit, .
unless and until, he attains God. On the other hand, actions that .
are performed for God, to please Him and are offered to Him,
are not perishable, but real (Gita 17/27). |

In the twenty-eighth verse of the seventeenth chapter also,
Lord Krsna declares ""Sacrifice, gift and penance and anyother
action, performed without faith, is declared as unreal (non- -
existent). It is of no use, here or hereafter."" It means, that a
man having disinclination for God, by performing actions such _
as sacrifice, gift and penance etc., cannot realize God. So his
actions are 1n vain. ,

‘Moghajfianah'—Knowledge of languages, scripts, arts,
literature and the universe etc., of those people, who have a
disinclination for God, is in vain, because that knowledge cannot
lead them, to salvation, they cannot be free, from the bondage of -
birth and death. By having a disinclination for God, even after
acquiring a lot of knowledge, they will follow a wrong course,
in the same way, as an accountant cannot maintain accounts
correctly if there is an error in any figure in the accounts. Thus,
they will have a fall. .

'Vicetasah'—They are senseless (fools), because, they cannot
discriminate between the real and the unreal, gain and loss, and
bondage and liberation etc.
"
1127,"1072 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 9

: 'Raksasimasurim  caiva, prakrtim mohinim éritah'—Such

senseless persons, having a disinclination for God, embrace a

nature which is fiendish, demoniacal and delusive. -
Persons, with demoniacal nature, are those who without caring,

for:the pain and loss of others, are ever engaged in their selfish

motives, in fulfilling their desires and hoarding money, for the |

enjoyment of their sensual pleasures etc. Oo
Persons, with a fiendish nature, are those who become angry

with those whom they think as obstacles, to the fulfilment of

their desires, and so they harm and ruin them, for their own |

selfish motive. | |
Persons, possessing a delusive nature, are those, who without

a rhyme or reason, trouble others. (They shoot flying birds and

hit a sleeping dog and are pleased.) | : -
Out of all the abovementioned, three natures, the basic

nature, is demoniacal. This demonical nature is of three types.

Demonical nature, is of those in whom desire predominates; : -

fiendish are those, in whom anger predominates and delusive,

those in whom delusion predominates. It means, that desire is -

the root of demoniacal nature. If desire is not fulfilled, anger is.

born (Gita 2/62), and from anger, ensues. delusion (2/63). This

delusion, is born of greed and folly, also. . |
Appendix—In this verse there is mention of the demoniacal

nature which has been described with its fruit in detail in the

sixteenth chapter by the Lord. The fruit of the people’ s demoniacal |

nature is that they are hurled into eighty-four lac wombs and hells

(Gita 16/19-20). The people of demoniacal nature don’t get the

fruit which they desire (moghasah), but they reap the unpleasant

fruit (punishment) of their action certainly. They commit sins in

order to derive pleasures but instead of having pleasures they

have to suffer pain certainly. They look down upon God and

its fruit is their own loss, what difference does it make in God?

Comment:— : : :
'Mahatmanastu mam partha daivirh prakrtimaéritah'—Here,
the term 'Tu' (But), has been used to explain singularity of the
devotees, possessing divine nature, which runs counter to delusive -
and demoniacal nature, mentioned in the previous verse.
""Daivirh prakrtim'—Here, 'Daiva' stands for God (Paramatma), -
and ‘prakrtim' stands for nature. God is 'Sat' (Real). So all the
good qualities and conduct, are included, in divine nature. -
_ The divine traits (Gita 16/1—3) are common and everyman,
has a full claim over them. It all depends upon him, whether he
possesses them or not. Those, who by possessing these, have an
inclination for God, attain salvation. |
One is discovery, while the other is creation or compound.
Discovery relates to the eternal entity which is ever-existent, and
creation or compound relate to the things which are born and are
perishable. Divine traits, belong to God and so they are, divine
property. A human being, being a fragment of God, has these
divine traits, as they are his inherent possession. This is discovery.
They are not bom, they are not his personal property.
Divine traits, are natural. If a man, thinks that he has cultivated
these traits, with his effort, he feels proud of them. But, if he
"
1129,"1074 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 9 :
feels that they are natural divine gift, he is not proud. A man's |
pride, is aroused only in imperfection. When a man has pride,
by saying, ""I always speak the truth"", it means, that sometimes
he tells a lie also, otherwise he cannot be proud of that. — -
A man, may possess divine traits, only when his sole aim
is to attain God. By depending on those traits, to realize God,
he can have.an inclination for Him, and then instead of having ,
pride, he possesses politeness, simplicity and modesty, and has
an ever enhancing zeal, in spiritual discipline. |
Men, who having a disinclination for God, are engaged in |
perishable pleasures and prosperity, are small souls or deluded :
persons, while those, who have an inclination for God and depend © :
only on Him, are great souls. |
'Bhajantyananyamanaso jiiatva bhutadimavyayam'—The Lord
is imperishable, and is the prime cause of creation. He is without -
a beginning and an end. Infinite universes, emanate from Him,
remain established in Him, and merge in Him, but He remains
the same, without any change. :
Out of worldly things, if a portion is taken out, it becomes
less. For example, if an ornament is made out of a lump of gold, -
or a utensil from a lump of clay, the lump becomes smaller. But
there is no change, in the Lord, even though infinite universes |
emanate, from Him, because He is the imperishable seed (Gita
9/18). Those, who know Him as imperishable and the prime cause
of creation, worship Him constantly, with undivided mind.
The more merits a man knows of something, the more
devoted he is to it. Those, who come to know, that the Lord is
the supreme, their minds are so much engrossed in Him, that they
never think of pleasures, either of this world or the next. Their
minds, are not attracted towards anything or anyone, besides the
Lord. So they adore Him, with an undivided mind.
Worship of the Lord, in anyway ts fruitful. But a devotee,
who worships Him with exclusive devotion, by having affinity

‘T am only God's and only God, is mine’ is immensely
benefited. A devotee, is engaged in worship for a few hours.

His relationship with God, remains. as long as he is, engaged

in worship. But an other devotee, regards himself as God's -
and God as his. His relationship with God, is everlasting,
because this eternal relationship is real and eternal. Whatever
actions, mundane or spiritual, he performs with his body,
senses, mind and intellect, are to please the Lord and so are
different forms of worship, to Him. This is adoration with an
undivided mind, which has been described in the Gita, time

-Appendix—In the preceding verse the Lord having described ,
the ways of the worldly people, which lead them to ruin, now

The people depending on the demoniac nature neither
believe in God nor follow His teachings (Gita 3/32). But the
‘people depending on the divine nature, believe in God and follow ;
His teachings (Gita 3/31). :

‘Jnatva bhutadimavyayam’—God is the imperishable seed 7
of infinite universes (Gita 7/10, 9/18)—this firm assumption is
to know God the prime cause of the creation and also to know
- Him imperishable. ‘Firm assumption’ is similar to ‘knowing’.

Constantly chanting My names and glories, striving firm in

vow, prostrating before Me, they worship Me with devotion, ever -

steadfast. 14

Comment:—

'Nityayuktah'—A man, can remain always steadfast, only in |
worshipping God, not in mundane pleasures and accumulation of
- prosperity, because he gets disgusted with pleasures and loses

taste for accumulation sometimes. But his determination and aim,

of God-realization, ever remain the same. :
Man (soul) being a portion of God, has real affinity for

Him. So long as, a man does not recognize that affinity, he has

a disinclination for the Lord, and assumes that he is separate from _

Him. But, when he recognizes his eternal affinity for Him, he is

inclined towards Him, and cannot remain separate from Him. —

The natural affinity of a man with God, 'I am God's and -

God is mine’, ever remains steadfast, in wakefulness, sleep,

sound sleep; in loneliness, during worship and in company, -

while performing different actions. As a man always remembers

that he is the son of Mr. X, so a striver accepts his affinity,

with the Lord that He, Who is the prime cause of creation, the |

Imperishable, the Supreme Lord is his and he is His, and thus

he, ever remains steadfast.

'Drdhavratah'—The worldly people, who are engaged in

pleasure and prosperity, cannot be firm in spiritual vows (Gita

2/44). But those, who have removed a sense of 'I'ness from their |

hearts, by accepting the fact ""We are God's and God is ours’,

they resolve ""We are not of the world, and the world is not

ours."" So, we have not to hanker after, worldly pleasures and

prosperity, but we have to serve others, by regarding them as God's.

Thus, they remain steadfast in their resolution, and never
"
1132,"Verse 14] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1077 7
deviate from it, because their aim is God-realization, and they
are, His fragments. .
""Yatantasca'—As worldly people, nourish their family with -
attachment, and strive for pleasure and prosperity, so do devotees
strive, for God-realization ardently. Efforts of such devotees,
seemingly mundane are not really mundane, as their aim is God. |
So their activities, are directed towards God.
'Bhaktya kirtayanto mam'—Devotees, sometimes chant the
names and glories of the Lord, sometimes read scriptures and
sometimes give divine talks, or hold divine discourses and so
on. All of these are as hymns of the Lord. -
'Namasyantasca'—They prostrate before the Lord, by having
the feeling that whatever divine traits they possess, and whatever
spiritual inclination they have, is only by His grace. They hold -
- that their promptness and inclination towards God, is not the
result of their own efforts. Virtues and good conduct, have been
developed in them, by His grace. So, they merely prostrate. 7
‘Satatam mam upasate'—The devotees, having undivided
devotion, perform all actions, whether spiritual or even mundane, 7
such as eating, drinking, sleeping, waking, business and farming
etc., only for Him, to please Him.

Comment:— |
[When a devotee according to his faith and reverence
establishes his affinity with the Lord, in His manifold aspects, -
his affinity, is with the real, because in the universe, there is no
existence besides the Lord. He should admit this fact, without
having any doubt, that in the universe, apart from God, there is
no object, no thought and no act. Similarly, the Lord is manifest
in diverse entities—there is no doubt about it. If a doubt lurks,
in mind how all objects can be the manifestation of God, this |
doubt, deprives the striver of emancipation. Rather, it puts him
into trouble. Therefore, it should be accepted firmly, that in gross
or subtle form, or as effect and cause, whatever is seen, heard,
grasped or assumed, is only God. This all-pervasiveness of God,
has been described, from the sixteenth to the nineteenth verse. ]

'‘Mantro'hamahamevajyamahamagniraham hutam'—He is,

'Vedyarn pavitramonkara rksama yajureva ca'—The Lord,
is the knowledge, of the method of sacrificial worship, which /

Acts of sacrifice, rewards and penance, are purifying to
the wise. (Gita 18/5). In them the articles of oblations, which -
are offered without expecting a fruit and the action, which is
performed without expecting its fruit, are also purified. That _
purity, is the Lord's manifestation.
Act of sacrifice, gifts and penance, as enjoined by scriptures, -
are always begun, with the utterance of the sacred syllable, 'O1n'

The Vedas, deal with methods of Vedic rituals, and sacrificial

and Brahma is born of Him. From this angle, He is the father
of Brahma. Arjuna, has also called Him the Primal Cause of
Brahma, (Gita 11/37). |
'Gatirbharta prabhuh saksi nivasah Saranar suhrt'—The Lord, -
is the Supreme Goal of beings. He is the supporter of beings :
because, all sustenance comes from Him. He, is the owner and
Lord, of the universe. He is witness because He knows all beings,
all the time, very well. He is the ‘Abode’ (Nivasa), because beings, -
rest in Him. He gives shelter, to beings, so He is refuge. He is
a disinterested friend, because He is their well-wisher, without -
expecting any reward.
‘Prabhavah pralayah sthanarm nidhanarh bijamavyayam'— -
The entire universe, emanates from Him and again merges in
Him. So, He is the origin, (the material cause and the efficient
cause) and end, of the entire universe (Gita 7/6). . |
He is the resting place (Sthana),* of the universe, because
at the time of final dissolution, the entire universe (including
Nature), merges in Him and rests in Him.
He is the storehouse (Nidhana), because in all the states
of creation and dissolution, etc., nature, the universe, soul and
everything else, reside, in Him, only.
‘The Lord, is the imperishable seed, because an ordinary seed
is born of a tree and then it perishes, when the plant sprouts up.
* 'Nivasa' (Abode) is the place where beings reside during the span
of creation while 'Sthana’ (resting place) is the place where the universe
(including Nature) remains merged in the period of dissolution.
"
1138,"Verse 16—18] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1083
But, the Lord after creating infinite universes, remains the same, |
and is without origin and end. He can never perish. a

Appendix—As from the view point of discipline of knowledge
‘modes are acting on the modes’ (Gita 3/28), similarly from the
view-point of a devotee, only God’s objects are being offered
to God. As a person worships the Ganges with Ganges-water,
worships the sun with a lamp, worships the earth with flowers,
similarly God is being worshipped by God’s objects. The fact
is that He Who is worshipped is God, the material for worship
is also God, the act of worship is also God and the worshipper
is also God. _ | -

The worldly seed is produced by farming but the unworldly
seed in the form of God, is not a born one (produced), therefore
the Lord in the seventh chapter declares Himself to be the eternal -
seed—‘bijarh mam sarvabhutanam viddhi partha sanatanam’
(7/10). Here the Lord declares that He is the imperishable
seed—‘bijamavyayam’. The reason is that the worldly seed ;
perishes, when the plant sprouts up, but the unworldly seed in
the form of God by producing infinite universes, remains the 7
same, there is not the least modification in the seed. It means
that God exists at the beginning of the entire creation and also |
exists at the end of it. The entity which exists at the beginning
and at the end also exists in the mid-state—this is the principle.
As several earthen wares are made of clay, remain in clay and at |
last merge into clay, similarly all the seeds of the entire universe
are born. of God, abide in God and at last merge into God
(Gita 10/39). It means that the worldly seed perishes when it
sprouts up but the imperishable seed in the form of God ever |
remains the same at the beginning, in the middle and at the end.
Therefore at present only God manifests Himself as the world.
There is nothing else besides Him.

I am also being and non-being, both. 19
Comment:— )
‘'Tapamyahamaham varsam nigrhnamyutsrjami ca'—The
Lord, in the form of the sun, cures ailments of beings, by drying :
impure and dirty materials, which cause ailments, on the earth. |
As the sun, the Lord radiates heat to dry the poisonous matter
of medicinal herbs and other vegetations. He dries water, to
make it pure and sweet, and then sends it back as rain, for the -
welfare of beings. |
‘Amrtam caiva mrtyuSca sadasaccahamarjuna'—The Lord, is -
immortality, as well as, death. He is immortality—it means that
all beings live by sustaining their life-breath, (they do not die). He
is death, as it means the departure of life-breath from the body,
of all beings (their death). He is being, as well as non-being, the
cause as well as, effect. It means, that as a great soul regards
that, all is God, in the view of the Lord also, He is all, though a
common man views death and immortality, being and non-being;
gross and subtle, sattva, rajas and tamas; cause and effect; water
and ice etc., different. But, in fact, the world is a manifestation
of the Lord. As in clothes made of yarn, there is nothing besides |
yarn, in so too things, actions, incidents, circumstances and men
etc., there is nothing else, besides God.
Appendix—God existed before the creation of the universe
and in the end God will remain, then in the mid-state who else
can be there besides God? Therefore immortality is a form of
God and death is also a form of God. The real (para prakrti)
"
1140,"Verse 19} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1085
is a form of God and the unreal (apara prakrti) is also a form
of God. As the food offered to God becomes ‘prasad’ (a gift
or blessing) from God and it includes both sweet food such as
‘rasagulla’ and ‘gulabajamuna’ and also bitter vegetables such as
‘karela’ (bitter gourd) and ‘methi’. Similarly the favourable as |
well as unfavourable circumstances—all are the manifestations
of God. The Lord as the sun withholds water and then sends
forth rain—these two opposite activities (withholding and sending —
back) are performed by God. Not only this but the water which
is withheld is God, the rain which is sent forth is God and the
action of raining is also God. ‘Sadasaccahamarjuna’—In the entire
universe there is nothing besides ‘sat’ (para) viz., the real and :
‘asat’ (apara) viz., the unreal. The world is unreal and the Lord
7 Who resides in it, is real. The body is unreal and the soul which
resides in it, is real. The body and the world are kaleidoscopic -
while the soul and God are free from modifications. The body
| and world are perishable, while the soul and God are imperishable
(Gita 2/12). The Lord declares that He is changeable and is also -
unchangeable, He is perishable and is also imperishable. It means
that all is God, there is nothing élse besides God (Gita 7/7). _
In ‘nasato vidyate bhavo, nabhavo vidyate satah’ while
differentiating ‘Sat’ from ‘Asat’ there is discrimination but
in ‘sadasaccaham’ there is no need of any discrimination but
there is faith (belief) required. All is God—this belief is more
powerful than discrimination. The reason is that discrimination
is useful when both the real and the unreal are distinguished.
But when the unreal does not exist at all, then what is the use |
of discrimination? If we assume the entity of the unreal, then
there is need for discrimination; but if we don’t assume the
entity of the unreal, then there is belief. In discrimination there
is division between the real and the unreal but in belief or faith
all being God there is no division at all. In faith there is only
the real viz., only God.
"
1141,"1086 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter9 ""
In the Discipline of knowledge, there is predominance of

discrimination while in the Discipline of Devotion, there is

predominance of. belief and love (devotion). In the. Discipline

of knowledge, discrimination between the real.and the unreal, the
self and the non-self, the eternal and the transient is important; .
so there is duality—‘dvaita’, but in the Discipline of Devotion,
belief in God is important, so there is non-dualism—‘advaita’.

It means that in fact there is real non-dualism in devotion as
there are no two entities. | 7 _
In the Discipline of Knowledge a striver negates the
unreal. By negation, the entity of the unreal can persist. The
more emphasis a striver lays on the negation of the unreal, the
more the assumption of the entity of the unreal is strengthened.

A. Therefore ‘to negate the unreal’, is not so good as is ‘to be
indifferent to it’. Better than indifference to it is the notion—‘all -
is God’. Therefore a. devotee neither negates the unreal nor is
indifferent to it, but he beholds God in all—the real and the
unreal because in fact all is God. | -

The Lord declares— | |
ahamevasamevagre nanyad yat sadasat param -
pascidaham yadetacca yo’vasisyet so’smyaham
(Srimadbha. 2/9/32)
‘Before the creation I was present, there was noting else
besides Me and after the creation whatever this world appears, I
am also that. The real, the unreal and that which can be beyond
both the real and the unreal, I am that.also, and when the creation’ |
is destroyed, whatever remains, I am also that.” _ 7
The body, senses, mind, intellect and ego etc., all is God.
For example if we think of Haridwara (with the mind), the mind
appears as the immovable objects such as ‘Hari ki paidi’ and. the
clock tower etc., and the mind appears as the movable objects
such as the Ganges, the sailing fish and the bathing persons, viz.,
the mind became both—the movable and the immovable objects.
"
1142,"Verse 20] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1087 -
Similarly the real is God and the unreal is also God.
| From our point of view there are two divisions—the real and
the unreal, therefore the Lord has used the expression—‘sadasa
ccaham’ in order to explain it to us, otherwise from the Lord’s
point of view, there is nothing else besides Him. If we perceive
even from the topmost philosophical point of view, we find that
there is only one entity. Two entities are not possible at all. A
man is deluded when he accepts the other entity (Gita 7/13).
Attachment and aversion ‘also ensue by assuming (accepting)
the other entity.

devabhogan'—Worldly people, are generally engaged, in worldly
pleasure. There are others, who attach value to perishable objects,
aspire for heavenly pleasure and so perform actions with a selfish :
motive, as laid down in the three -Vedas for them. The term
'Traividya’, has been used, for such people. __ :
_ Soma is a plant about which it is said, that in the bright

half of a lunar month, everyday, on.it one leaf sprouts forth and
upto the full-moon-day there are fifteen leaves, while in the dark
half of a lunar month, everyday one leaf falls, and in fifteen
days all the leaves fall.* Those who perform religious sacrifice, :
purify the sap of soma-plant with Vedic sacred formulas and
then drink it. Thus, they are purged of sins which are obstacles,
to heavenly enjoyment.

The Lord, in the preceding verse declared, that He is, being
and non-being, both. So here, the term ‘Mam’ has been used for
Indra, the lord of the gods, because when He‘is, being and non- _
being, both, He is also Indra. Moreover, persons who perform
sacrifice, in order to reach heaven, worship Indra, and pray to -
him to grant them, an access to heaven.

With the view to attain heaven, they sing hymns in pratse of
Indra, and beg of him, residence in heaven—both for these are
prayers. As a reward of the performance, of Vedic and Pauranika

* The Soma plant which has fifteen leaves, whose shape is like a serpent,
whose knots are red from where the leaves sprout forth, with the five parts (root,
branch, leaves, flower and fruit) brought on the full-moon-day binds mercury.
The Soma tree also with five organs (root, bark, leaves, flower and fmiit) binds
mercury and makes its ash and so on. Out of the Soma climber and Soma tree
the Soma climber possesses more properties. In the dark fortnight each day one
leaf falls from this part while in the light fortnight each day one leaf sprouts
forth. Thus this climber plant grows. If the root-fruit (Kanda) of this plant is
taken out on the full-moon-day, it is very useful. The mercury bound in this
root-fruit with thorn-apple makes the body iron-like strong and it has a hundred
thousand times-more effect 1.e., its one particle changes a hundred thousand
particles of iron into gold. This Soma climber plant is very rarely found.

rituals, they are granted celestial enjoyments. Those heavenly
pleasures, are far- more attractive and singular, than those of
the mortal world. There, they enjoy five sense-objects of sound,
touch, form, taste and smell. Moreover, they also enjoy other .
luxuries, honour and glory etc. |
'  Appendix—Here is the description of such people who
strongly believe in the existence of the world and who value it |
and whose worship to God is a mistaken approach (Gita 9/23).
The fruit of the worship of such people is perishable (Gita 7/23).
Because. of being within the entire form of God, all is God;
therefore here for Indra (the lord of gods) the term ‘mam’ has
been used. The term ‘punyam’ has been used for Indra’s paradise
because it is purer than the human world.

Having enjoyed, the extensive heavenly world, they return

Comment:—
""Te tarn bhuktva svargalokam visalam ksine punye martyalokarn

labhante'—The heavenly world, has been called extensive, because
"
1145,"1090 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter9 .
it is vast, there age is longer, and pleasures are, in abundance.
Those who want to go to heaven, instead of depending on
God, rely on actions with interested motive, enjoined by. the
three Vedas. They go to heaven and are obliged to return to this
world, after their merits run out. Here again, they acquire merits
and thus, the wheel of going and coming back, revolves.
- If the meaning of 'Putapapa’, of the previous verse, is taken, :
as those who are purged of all sins and the meaning of 'Ksine
punye’, is taken as those whose merits are destroyed, it means,
that being free from all sins and merits, they should have been
liberated from bondage. But they do not attain liberation, they,
rather go and come. So the terms, mean that they are purged :
of only those sins which are obstacles to go to heaven; and
their merits are exhausted after enjoying, heavenly pleasures.
Therefore, reference is not, in context of the exhaustion of all -
their sins and merits. - — a

To those men, who worship Me alone, thinking of none but .

Comment:— |
‘Ananyascintayanto maim ye janah paryupasate'—Those,
who admit, that the entire universe is the Lord's manifestation,
and all the activities and changes are His sport, and do not
attach importance to anything else, besides the Lord, because
everything except the Lord, is perishable. They have no desire,
"
1146,"Verse 22] ~ - SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1091 °
even for the maintenance of their bodies. So, they have exclusive
devotion, for Him. Whatever action, moving, eating, drinking
or talking etc., they perform, is in order to, please God. By
regarding the Lord, as loving and glorious, the memory, of the
Lord in devotees, is constant and natural. These devotees are |
called ‘Ananya’ (exclusively devoted), because for them, the Lord
- is both the means and an end. They have a firm conviction, that
they have to take refuge in God only, they have to adore and
think of Him only, and they have to attain Him, only. They do
not harbour any other desire, except that of the Lord.
| 'Tesarn nityabhiyuktanam'—'Nityabhiyuktanam' (of those ever
united), are those, who having undivided devotion, think of Him
and perform all actions, to please Him. They, have a disinclination
for the world, an inclination for the Lord, and perform actions
by depending on Him. In other words, their disinclination for the -
world, is their ‘Ananyata' (exclusive devotion), their inclination
for the Lord is their 'Cintana’ (constant memory), and in all _
active and inactive conditions, circumstances whatever, he does,
is their 'Upasana’ (worship). Those devotees, who possess these :
three traits, are 'Nityabhiyukta' (ever devout). :
: ""Yogaksemam vahamyaham'—'Yoga means, the provision
of the means required, and 'Ksema' means, -security of what
has been gained. : :
But, the fact is that ""Yoga' means, either to attend or not to
attend to the needs of devotees, because the Lord is a disinterested
friend, of devotees, so He remains engrossed, in their welfare.
He provides only those means, which are useful, for their
welfare. Similarly, He protects what. has been provided, only
if its security, is a means in their spiritual progress. Otherwise,
He will destroy it. Destruction of harmful things, is 'Ksema' |
(security). Therefore, His devout devotees, remain pleased and
satisfied, in all circumstances, because they believe that those
circumstances have been created by God's will, and so they will
"
1147,"1092 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter9 -

- enable them to attain, salvation. They, become puppets in the
hands of the Lord, and God's will, becomes their will.

In fact ""Yoga’ means, affinity with God and 'Ksema’ means
salvation. From this view-point, the Lord strengthens a devotee's ;
affinity with Him, and tries to lead him to salvation. Therefore, |
Lord Krsna, in the forty-fifth verse of the second chapter, orders
Arjuna. ""Don't worry about ""Yoga' and 'Ksema”. It means that a |
devotee should be free, from any care for gain and security.

'Vahamyaham'—It means, that as a mother, looks after her
smali son and provides him cheerly with all necessities, similarly :
the Lord provides, all the means required by the devotees. .
Appendix—The Lord here mentions the superiority of His :
devotees to those, who perform actions with interested motive,
enjoined by the Vedas as described in the preceding verse, and
also to those who worship other gods. The devotees, who have 7
exclusive devotion for God, neither believe in Indra, who has been
described in the preceding verse nor believe in other gods as is -
described in the next verse. Those who worship Indra etc., reap
the limited fruit for their worship, according to their desire. But
the worshippers of God receive limitless fruit. The worshippers a
of gods are like paid labours (servants) while the worshippers
of God are like the members of the family. If a labour works, |
he is paid the hmited amount of money as wages according to
his labour (work), but if a member of the house works, he is
the master of the entire wealth (money) of the family. |
The ‘ananya bhaktas’ (devotees with exclusive devotion) are
those who hold that there is no other entity besides God—‘*Uttama
ke asa basa mana mahirh, sapanehti ana purusa jaga nahirh’
(Manasa, Aranya 5/6). |
“Yogaksemarm vahamyaham’—The Lord provides the devotee
all the necessary means required by him and provides security
of what has been gained—this is the Lord’s ‘yogaksemam
vahamyaham’. Though the Lord provides gain and security to
"
1148,"Verse 23] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1093
all strivers, yet he specially provides gain and security to those
devotees who have exclusive devotion for Him in the same way
as a mother brings up her loving child herself instead of leaving
it under the care (supervision) of a servant —

approach. 23 7 -
Comment:— |
'Ye'pyanyadevata: bhakta yajante Sraddhayanvitah'—These |
devotees, who have not realized, that the Lord is all-being and
non-being, (Gita 9/19) worship other gods, because they think
that other gods are apart from and independent of Him, and that
by their grace they will gain everything.
'Te'pi mameva kaunteya yajantyavidhipirvakam'—Devotees,
who worship other gods, actually worship Him, because, in the
whole universe, there 1s nothing besides, Him. Therefore, their
worship to other gods is worship to Him, only, but that is a mistaken
‘approach. The Lord, by the expression ""Yajantyavidhiptrvakam’,
does not mean that they do not possess knowledge—what sort of
worship—materials, what sacred text, should be used, and what
"
1149,"1094 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter9 |
sort of worship, should be done. But, it means, that they regard
other gods separate, from the Lord. They worship other gods,
because their wisdom has been led astray, by desires (Gita 7/20).
But the fact is, that whatever power, the other gods have, has
come to them, from the Lord, and so it is only, His power.
| It means that, if a devotee worships any deity, regarding
him as the Lord, without having any desire for fruit, that will
be worship to God, and it will lead him to God-realization.
Secondly, if he worships the Lord, with a desire, he will be
regarded as a devotee—a seeker of worldly objects, a sufferer |
etc., whom the Lord has called noble, (Gita 7/18). , -
In fact, all is God. So every kind of worship, service and |
good, offered to others, is only an offering to God. As rain-
water, in the form of a stream, river and waterfall etc., ~
flows into the sea (because that water comes from the sea
and belongs to the sea), whomsoever, a devotee worships, he -
worships, only God. , , | ,
_Appendix—‘Traividya mam’ (9/20), ‘Ananyascintayanto -
mam’ (9/22) and ‘te’pi mameva’ (9/23)—the Lord has used the
term ‘mam’ in these three verses which means that all is God, 7
therefore the Lord knows all as His manifestation. If a striver
has no desire and beholds God in all, he may worship anyone,
that is indeed the worship to God. It means that if he has the
disinterested motive and regards other gods as the manifestation
of God, then his worship to gods will not remain the mistaken
approach but will be worship to God only.
In the seventh chapter the term ‘devayajah’ was used (7/23),
the same has been mentioned here as ‘yajante’.

circumstances, actions and beings, including ‘their senses, bodies, -
minds and intellects, as the entire universe, has emanated from
Him and so, He is their Lord. | .
The Lord is the enjoyer. What does it mean?
The Lord has declared, ""A great soul realizes, that all this
is, God"" (Gita 7/19) and ""In my view, I am being and non-
being, both"" (Gita 9/19). It means, that when a devotee performs :
virtuous actions, such as sacrifice, charity, penance or provides
food to the hungry, helps the destitute, waters plants, feeds dogs
and birds etc., all of these are enjoyed by the Lord, because it -
is He Who has manifested Himself, in. different forms.* Thus
a devotee, serves the Lord only, with all these articles offered
to the hungry, the needy, and to anyone else, in His universal -
form. The Lord, is the enjoyer of all, whatsoever, is offered to
Him, in diverse forms. oe -
How is, He the Lord? |
Devotees regard God, as the Lord of the higher and the
lower nature. He is the master of the entire universe, and so
He is free in creating, preserving, destroying, conducting, and
enjoying this entire universe, and also in bringing about, any
change in it. Thus He is the Lord.
* There is an anecdote. Once the saint named Namadeva went for
pilgrimage. There he cooked food and went to take clarified-butter. In the
meanwhile a dog came there and ran with a loaf of bread. Saint Namadeva ran
after him with clarified-butter-pot and said, ""O Lord, I wanted to offer this loaf
of bread: with clarified-butter to You. Why are You running away?"" As soon as
he uttered these words, the Lord manifested Himself because in the form of that
dog there was no one else besides the Lord. Thus whatever is offered to anyone,
is offered only to God.

those, who do not know this fact, think that if they offer food |

or water to creatures, it is received by them, and so they are

enjoyers. But, actually the real enjoyer is the Lord. So, without

perceiving the Lord, in different manifestations, they fall.

Therefore, every person should regard the Lord, as the enjoyer.

Thus, whatever is offered to anyone, should be offered only to

Him, knowing it to be His. :

Secondly, all the worldly pleasures and prosperity, are the -
Lord's and are for the service of the Lord, Who has manifested
Himself, in the form of the universe. But, people attached to
pleasures and prosperity, by considering these their own, think that
they are their master, but actually they become slaves to them. -
By depending on them, they regard these as part and parcel of
their life, while they are really different, from them. Thus they -
have a fall. But if they know the fact, that God is the enjoyer

- and the Lord of, all the sacrifices, they are liberated. -

‘Cyavanti' (fall) means, that without attaining God, they fall.

By performing virtuous actions, they go to higher regions, such
as heaven etc., but having enjoyed heavenly pleasures, they have
to return to the world of mortals (Gita 9/21). Thus, instead of
attaining salvation, they have to follow the wheel of birth and
death. This is their fall. | |

Appendix—In the end of the fifth chapter the Lord declared,

‘I am the enjoyer of all sacrifices and austerities’—-“bhoktaram
yajiiatapasam’ (5/29). There the Lord declared in an affirmative
way that he who has realized Him as the enjoyer of all sacrifices
attains peace; and here by negative inference He declares that
these, who don’t know Him as the enjoyer (recipient) of all
sacrifices, have a fall. When a man himself becomes the enjoyer,
he has a fall. If he regards the Lord as the enjoyer of all virtuous
"
1153,"1098 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 9 -
actions, he no longer remains an enjoyer, and his desire for

pleasure is wiped out, and without the desire for pleasure he

attains peace.

In fact only God is the ultimate doer and ultimate enjoyer :
of all actions. But in spite of being a doer and an enjoyer, He :
remains untainted viz., He has no sense of doership or enjoyership
(no desire for the fruit of action)—‘tasya kartaramapi math |

Those who worship the gods, with self-interest, go to gods, after ;
death, those who worship the manes come to the manes, those who
adore the evil-spirits, join the evil-spirits. But, those who worship .
Me, attain Me, alone. 25
Comment:—

[In the preceding verse, the Lord declared, that He is the
enjoyer of all sacrifices, and the Lord of the entire universe. |
But, those who instead of, regarding Him as the enjoyer and
the Lord, themselves become enjoyers and the Lord, have a fall.

Now, in this verse, He explains, how they fall.]

'Yanti devavrata devan'—Those, who do not know reality, |
about the Lord, but hanker after worldly pleasures and prosperity,
worship other gods, and follow rites, relating to them (Gita 7/20).

Those gods, carry their devotees to their abodes, but they have
"
1154,"Verse 25] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 14099 -
to return from there, because all the worlds from the abode of
Brahma downwards, are subject to return (Gita 8/16)...

In the twenty-third verse, the Lord declares, that those
devotees who worship other gods, also worship Him. alone, -
though not with a proper approach. It means; that those devotees
do not know, that all is God. Their.aim of worship, is to
get worldly pleasures and prosperity, so they fall. If they had :
worshipped, either the Lord or even gods, without having any )
desire, they instead of attamning the gods, would have attained,
the Lord. Had they not desired anything, from the gods (as
manifestation of the Lord), and the Lord and even if the Lord .
and the gods had offered them, they should have declined the -
offer. They should have rather responded, ""O Lord! You are
ours, and we are Yours. Had the worldly things (pleasures and
prosperity) been more valuable than this affinity with You, we -
would have desired or begged of You. But there is nothing
more valuable, than this affinity. So why should we. beg?""

- Having such sentiments, they would have become a source of ~
bliss to Him, and they would not have attained, the perishable
and inferior, celestial world. . -
-‘PitFnyanti pitrvratah'—Those, who want their desires to be
satisfied, worship the manes, by regarding them as their favourite
deity. But the greatest desire, that can be satisfied by the manes,
is that they can take their devotees, to their abode.

'Bhitani yanti bhitejya'—Persons possessing the mode of
ignorance (darkness), worship the spirits and ghosts, to fulfil |
their worldly desires. They worship spirits at night, on the
cremation ground with meat, wine and incantations etc. The
maximum benefit they can get is that those evil-spirits, can fulfil
their worldly desires. But after death, they go to the spirits 1e.,
become evil-spirits. So

'Yanti madyajino'pi mam'—Those, who think of Me and
worship Me, with exclusive devotion, attain Me, certainly.
"
1155,"1100 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 9 .
Those, who worship other gods, manes and spirits etc.,
for worldly pleasures and prosperity, have to go to hell or to “
follow, the cycle of birth and death in eighty-four lac forms
of lives. In human birth, by having affinity of love with God, :
they could be a source of bliss to Him. But being engrossed in |
: cheap worldly desires, they adore petty gods, manes and evil- |
spirits, and thereby get entangled in a vicious circle. Therefore,
they should devote themselves only to God, very cautiously. If
they worship the Lord, they can attain Him. Or if they worship
others regarding them as manifestation of the Lord, without a -
desire for the fruit of worship, they can attain Him. Regarding
them, as separate from the Lord, and having a desire for fruit,
these are the two causes of downfall. _
Birth as an evil-spirit is very bad, impure and so, is their,
worship. So those who worship spirits, have a sure downfall,
‘because, they can never behold them as a manifestation of God,* -
nor can serve them, without a selfish motive.
Here is an anecdote. There was a man, who worshipped -
a female spirit, called 'Karna’ (she when under the control of
someone, is said to, reveal to him all secrets). When anyone |
went to him, to get an answer for his question, he could know
the question, and would answer it. He earned a lot of money.
Someone wanted to learn his secret. He said, that he applied
excreta to his ear and with the help of ‘Karna’ a female spirit, |
he come to know, the question and answer into my ear. But at |
the time of his death he wanted to run to the bank of the river
Narmada, so that he could attain salvation. But that female evil-
* If a devotee regards an evil-spirit as the manifestation of God, the
evil-spirit attains emancipation and the devotee has a vision of God. Once the
devotee, Namadeva saw an evil-spirit of a very big .size. Namadeva prayed to it
by regarding it as his favourite deity with the result that the evil-spirit attained
emancipation and God revealed Himself to him.
"
1156,"Verse 26] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1101 ”
spirit presented herself, as a female hog, and killed him. Thus, she
took him to her abode. So, the worship of spirits, is forbidden.

But strivers, can offer oblations of food and water, to evil- :
spirits and ghosts, so that they may be liberated, from the life |
of evil-spirits. Even, saints and great souls, have done so.

Appendix—The term ‘Vrata’ mean precept (rule). Therefore the

‘term ‘devavrata’ means—to follow precepts relating to the worship
of gods (Gita 7/20). By taking refuge in God, performance of
action for Him is “worship to God’—‘Svakarmana tamabhyarcya
siddhim vindati manavah’ (Gita 18/46).

If all actions are offered to God, it is worship to God (Gita :
9/27). If actions are performed in a disinterested manner and they |
are offered to God, then no forbidden action can be performed
because it is due to desire only that forbidden actions are done -
(Gita 3/36-37).

In fact all is the manifestation of God. But he who assumes -
(accepts) any other entity besides God, does not attain salvation.

Even if he goes to the highest worlds, he has to return from
there to this mortal world (Gita 8/16).

Comment:—
[All the things and actions, belong to the lower nature, of
the Lord. But, a man by identifying himself with these becomes
their enjoyer, and lord. Actually the Lord is their enjoyer and
master. So, the Lord, orders devotees, to offer all things and
actions to Him (9/27). By doing so, they will be free, from
bondage forever (9/28).] - . 7
Secondly, in the worship of gods séveral ordinances etc.,
are to be observed, but in attaining Him, there are no rules )
and regulations, because a man (soul) being His fraction has
natural affinity, with him. So he can attain the Lord, without -
any formalities with firm feelings of affinity with Him, in the
same way, as a child can go to the lap of its mother, without
any formality. | | | .
""Patra pusparm phalam toyarh yo me bhaktya prayacchati'—A
Devotee, who offers, with love a leaf (basil leaf etc.,) a flower, a
fruit or even water, the Lord, appears in person and accepts the “
article offered, by him, with love. The Lord, satisfied the three
worlds by demanding a leaf from Draupadi, and by eating it. He
liberated, the elephant who offered Him a flower. He relished
the fruit offered by Sabari so much, that he could never forget
it and always praised, her hospitality. When Rantideva offered
water, to the Lord Who came as a person of low-caste, he had
His vision. :
When a devotee, is absorbed in devotion, he forgets what
he is offering, to the Lord. Similarly, the Lord 1s also so much
absorbed in love, that He takes no heed, of what He is eating. |
The Lord, ate the rind of the bananas, offered by Vidura's wife,
with. love. : : oo
""'Tadahamm bhaktyupahrtamasnami prayatatmanah'—The Lord,
not only accepts the offering of devotees, but also eats it. As a
flower, is to be smelt but the Lord eats it, because it was offered
by a devotee, with love. It means that if a devotee wants to offer
"
1158,"Verse 26] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1103 :
food to the Lord, He immediately, feels hungry.

‘Prayatatmanah' stands for the devotee, whose heart remains
engrossed in God, and who totally depends only on Him. The
Lord, partakes the articles offered, by such a loving devotee. .

Here, a leaf, flower, or fruit and water denote all things.

The reason is, that a leaf, a flower, and a fruit are the effects,
of the cause of water, as all the three are born, of water. So
all objects (things) of the entire universe, are denoted by them,
as all are the result of water. So all things should be offered,
to the Lord. |

In this verse, the term ‘Bhakti’ (Devotion), has been used, ”
two times. 'Bhaktya’, shows devotion of a devotee, while
‘Bhaktyupahrtam’, is an adjective, for the thing offered with |
devotion. It means, that when a devotee offers a thing with -
devotion, it becomes a symbol of devotion (love), and so the
Lord, eats it because He has a craving for love.

In this verse, there is stress on devotion (love), rather than -
of objects, as the Lord, has a thirst for loving sentiment, not for
objects. As a chaste wife, and an obedient disciple, feel highly
delighted by serving her husband and the preceptor respectively,

a devotee is very much delighted by offering a thing to the

Lord, because he feels that the Lord by His special grace, has

given him an opportunity to serve Him, with a thing, which is :
actually His. — |

The Lord, eats the thing, offered with devotion. There is
an anecdote in this connection. There was a priest who offered
almonds, walnuts, cashew nuts and pistachio nuts etc., to the
Lord in the temple, from the Diwali festival to the Holi festival.

But, when these nuts became costly, he began to offer ground
nuts. One day, the priest had a vision of the Lord, in his dream.
The Lord said, ""My dear, you have started to offer, only ground
"
1159,"1104 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter9
nuts.” The priest again started to offer almond etc: The priest
was convinced, that the Lord ate the things offered, to Him.

It 1s said, by saints that things offered to the Lord, with
devotion, become unusual in smell, and taste etc., and are not 7
spoiled, with passage of time. This is not a hard-and fast rule,
but it depends upon,.the devotion of.a devotee...»

When articles are offered as oblation, into fire, it is sacrifice;
when they are offered to others, it is called charity. When by
abstinence, they are not used for one's ownself, it becomes austerity;
and when these are offered to God, which lead to union with
Him—all these are different names, of renunciation. . — :

Appendix—lIn order to worship the gods, several rules have

_ to be observed (followed) (Gita 7/20), but in the worship of God
there is no rule. In the worship of God there is predominance of -
love (devotion) and one’s regarding Him as one’s own, rather
than of any method—‘bhaktya prayacchati’, “‘bhaktyupahrtam’.

As an innocent (simple hearted) child puts into its mouth
whatever comes to its hand, similarly the Lord by becoming simple ;
hearted eats whatever is offered to Him by the simple hearted
devotee—‘ye yatha mar prapadyante tarnstathaiva bhajamyaham’

(Gita 4/11); as Vidurani offered the peel of a banana to Lord
Krsna, He ate it with a great relish. | a

The expression ‘bhaktya prayacchati’ means that a devotee
offers a thing to God with love (devotion), not with a desire. In |
the worship of gods certain things are necessarily required but
in the worship of God nothing particular is required, but only
love or devotion is required. :

_ [It is a policy of the Lord, that howsoever men approach
Him, even so does, He seek them (Gita 4/11). When a devotee
offers his things, to the Lord, the Lord also responds with His
gift. The things offered by a devotee are limited, while those
granted by the Lord, are limitless. If a devotee offers himself
to the Lord, the Lord also offers Himself to him. Actually, the -
Lord has already offered Himself, to the universe (Gita 9/4) and
also has offered freedom, to them. So, if they offer the freedom
bestowed by Him to Him, He will also offer, His freedom to ""
them, and thus depend on them. Therefore, Lord Krsna orders
Arjuna to offer that freedom to Him.] -
""Yatkarosi'—This expression, includes all scriptural, physical,
vocational, social, spiritual and mundane, actions. Lord Krsna
orders Arjuna, to offer all actions to Him. If he offers himself
to Him, all his actions will be spontaneously offered, to Him.
Now, Lord Krsna divides those actions, into different parts.
""Yadaésnasi'—This expression, includes all the physical actions,
as taking meals, drinking water, taking medicines, wearing clothes,
walking, sleeping,. waking, bathing etc. __
-'Yajjuhosi'—This expression. includes, all the sacrificial
actions, such as arrangement of material for sacrifice, burning fire,
chanting sacred formulas, and offering oblation, to the sacred fire.

'Yattapasyasi'—It includes all actions that a devotee
performs, by way of penance: such as control over.sense-organs,
discharging duty, facing unfavourable and favourable circumstances
happily, pilgrimage, fasting, adoration, meditation, chanting and |
trance etc. Oo :
'Tatkurusva madarpanam'—It means, that by offering every
action, to the Lord, the devotee becomes free from the feeling |
of 'I'ness and 'Mineness', which binds him, and he attains
perfection, having attained which, he does not reckon any other
gain greater than that, and established in which he is not moved :
even by great sorrow, and which is free, from the contact of -
pain (Gita 6/22-23). OO :
In this verse, 'Yat' (whatever) has been used five times,
which means that the offer of each of the actions, is of great
merit. But how much more meritorious it will be, if all actions, -
are Offered to Him. . a
In the twenty-sixth verse, Lord Krsna said, that.a devotee _
should offer a leaf, a flower, a fruit or even water, to Him. All
these things are easily available, but they require a little effort.
In the twenty-seventh verse, He said that whatever action a
devotee performs he should offer it to, God. It means, that there
is nothing new, whether an article or action should be offered
to God. But a devotee, should offer himself to, God. By doing |
so, all his actions will be automatically offered, to the Lord.
As a mother, is pleased with different actions, such as jumping,
running, playing, smiling etc., of a child, so the Lord is pleased
with different actions of a devotee, as he becomes His.
But, it does not mean, that forbidden actions are to be offered
to the Lord. The Lord is offered only things and actions that are
sanctioned by scriptures. As, a thing which suits a saint is given
to him, a thing or action which suits the Lord, is offered to Him.

_ Now, if anyone offers forbidden actions, such as theft etc., to |
the Lord, according to the scriptures, he will acquire its manifold
fruit, i.e., he will be be severely punished.
Appendix—To offer something honourably to the person to
whom it belongs is called ‘arpana’ (to dedicate). The Lord has
used the term. ‘prayacchati’ for offering things and has used the
term ‘arpanam’ for dedicating actions in the expression ‘tatkurusva ,
madarpanam’ because actions are not given.
A Jiianayogi renounces the assumed affinity with the world
but a devotee does not assume any other entity besides God. In
other words a Jnanayogi renounces the sense of ‘T’ and ‘mine’ .
and a devotee accepts ‘thou’ and ‘thy’. Therefore a Jhaanayogi
renounces objects and actions and a devotee dedicates objects .
and actions to God viz., without having the sense of possession
over those objects and actions, regard them as God’s and the -
manifestation of God. :
When a man regards a thing as real and values it, it is very -
difficult to renounce it, by regarding it as unreal; but it is easy to
offer the same thing to any other person, to render service to him
with it. Then if it is offered (dedicated) to the most venerable,

. the most beloved God, how easy it is! Secondly the person who.
renounces a thing may he proud of his renunciation but he who
dedicates it to God, can’t be proud of his dedication, because if
the thing which belongs to God, is dedicated to Him, how can
the devotee be proud of it? ‘Tvadiyarn vastu govinda tubhyameva
samarpaye’. All objects (the entire universe) belong to God from
time immemorial. ‘Dedicating them to God’ means to rectify the

_ mistake of regarding them as his own. When a mistake rectified,

a man is not proud of his such act of rectification; rather he gets
pleased at the removal of the mistake. ee

When a striver regards the world as God’s, his affinity

with the world is renounced viz., the world disappears, the

independent existence of the world does not persist any more
"
1163,"1108 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter9 ~
(which really does not exist) but only God remains (Who really
exists). Therefore a devotee needs no discrimination in order to
renounce affinity with the world. He does not renounce affinity
with the world but regards the world as God’s or as God’s /
manifestation because the ‘apara prakrti’ (lower. nature) also -
belongs to God (Gita 7/4). |

Comment:— |
'‘Subhasubhaphalairevarn moksyase karmabandhanaih'—
By offering all things and actions 1.e., by offering himself, a
devotee, becomes free from good and bad results, of actions
performed in innumerable births. In human life, such a man |
does not perform evil actions. All his actions, are performed in
accordance with the ordinance of scriptures and saints. But, by
chance, if a forbidden action is performed by him, the Lord who
is installed in his heart, destroys it. .
All actions performed, with body, mind, intellect and senses
etc., are external, and so their good or bad result, in the form of
favourable or unfavourable circumstances, is also external. But if
"
1164,"Verse 28] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI , 1109 ~
a man by error accepts his affinity with those circumstances, and
thus feels happy and sad, the feeling of sadness and happiness,

: is bondage which leads him, to the wheel of birth and death. On
the other hand, a devotee, in all the favourable and unfavourable
circumstances, regarding them as God's will, feels God's grace
and becomes free from bondage.

‘Sannyasayogayuktatma'—It means, that a devotee should |
offer all his actions to God. Here ‘Sammnyasa'’, does not stand
for the Discipline of Knowledge. It means, surrender to God,
as is mentioned in 18/57 also.

As a Sankhyayog! rests happily in the self, or in God, mentally -
relegating all actions to the body with nine doors (Gita 5/13) |
a devotee, offers all his actions of innumerable births and their
fruits, to God. | -

""Vimukto m&amupaisyasi'—A devotee after becoming free,
from bondage, attains God. | —

What is, bondage of good* and evil actions? _

Every action, whether good or evil, has a beginning and
an end. Similarly, there is connection and disconnection of
circumstances, as fruit of actions. It means, that if an action and |
its fruit are transitory, how can affinity with them, be lasting?

But, when the eternal self assumes affinity with actions, he is
connected with their fruits. Though his affinity with actions and ,
their fruits, is not possible, yet he assumes this affinity. He (self)

is eternal. So his assumed affinity, which he accepts in himself,

also appears to be eternal.

He feels happy when good actions, bear fruit, in the form
of favourable circumstances. But, this happiness does not persist

* As evil actions lead to bondage, so do good actions lead to bondage. As
shackles whether of gold or iron bind a man, so do both virtuous and evil actions
lead to bondage as they conduce a man to rebirth.
"
1165,"1110 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter9 -

for a long time. So he has a desire for happiness. This desire, is

the root of all sorrow. Before happiness, there was sorrow and

again it will end in sorrow. It means, that so long as, he has a

desire for happiness, he cannot escape sorrow. |
When he surrenders himself to God, he realizes his real |

identity with God, (because he as a fraction of the Lord) and his

assumed affinity, with the body perishes. Actually, he already

had his: identity with God, but he did not realize it because he

performed actions with a selfish motive. But, when he offers

actions, as well as himself to God, he attains His love, naturally.

In that state, he feels the Lord's grace, in both the favourable -

and unfavourable circumstances. As a kind mother, shows her ;

affection in rearing, as well as, in scolding a child, so does the

Lord, by sending favourable and unfavourable circumstances to

shower His grace, on devotees. A devotee,without paying any -

heed to favourable and unfavourable circumstance, meditates

only on, God. -
Appendix—The Lord, by the expression ‘yanti madyajino’ pi

mam’ (9/25) (those who worship Me, attain Me alone) whatever -

started saying, while concluding the same, He declares, “By

dedicating all actions and objects to Me, you will be free from

the bondage of actions, having good and _ bad result; and freed

from them, you yourself having completely surrendered to Me,

shall attain Me.”
Actions are also good and bad and their fruit (result) is

also good and bad. Actions which are done for. the welfare of

others, are good; and which are done for one’s own self, are

bad. Favourable circumstance is the good result and unfavourable

circumstance is the bad result. A devotee of God dedicates good

actions to God, he does not do bad actions and 1s not happy and

sad in good and bad result viz., in favourable and unfavourable

circumstances. His ‘sajicita’ (accumulated) actions of infinite

lives are burnt to ashes in the same way as a burning piece of -

affinity (attachment) with the world is renounced and there :
remains relationship with only God, which has naturally ever — .
been there—‘mamaivarhgo jivaloke jivabhitah sanatanah’ (Gita
15/7). By regarding the mundane, which is not ours, as ours,
we are ensnared in bondage. By regarding the things as ours,
only bondage persists, the things don’t persist. A devotee has
no sense of mine (possession) with any object, person or action,
so he is freed from the bondage. = | |
Here ‘Samarpanayoga’ has been called ‘Sannyasayoga’. -

from them. The beings ‘can be different by birth, by actions, by
circumstances, by incidents and by union and disunion etc., but
He always and equally, pervades all of them. -

""Na me dvesyo'sti na priyah*'~—The Lord, has neither attachment
for the virtuous persons, nor aversion to, the evil ones. He loves,
all beings equally. But, the virtuous people, desiring fruits for .
their virtuous actions, go to higher regions, while evil-doers go
to hell, and pass eighty-four lac forms of lives. :

The Lord, provides earth, water, fire, air and ether, equally -
to all beings because these are His portion. As a man, has neither
attachment to a healthy limb, nor aversion for a diseased one, the -
Lord, has neither attachment for the virtuous persons, who follow
His precepts, nor aversion to the evil-doers as also, His critics
because, He is the same, to all beings. He has no partiality. It
is partiality, from which attachment and aversion, evolve.

""Ye bhajanti tu mam bhaktya | mayi te tesu capyaham'—

Those, who worship the Lord with devotion, without having
any attachment for the world, and work:to please Him, are in
Him and He is in them (Gita 9/14; 10/9). 7

It does not mean, that other beings are not in Him, but it
means that they do not accept this fact, they think that they are

* Here the term ‘Priyah' stands for attachment not for loving because all
beings are loving to the Lord as they are born of him (Manasa 7/85/2). The Lord
always emphasizes the fact that one should be free from attachment and aversion.

So here the term has been used for attachment.
"
1168,"Verse 29] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1113
worldly and so they remain established, in the world, and a body,
which are transitory. But those, who regard the Lord, as pervading
everywhere, all the time, in all things, incidents, circumstances
and beings, are specially, in Him and He is specially, in them.
| Secondly, those who have this affinity, that they are the
Lord's and He is theirs, they become so much intimate, that they
become one. So they are in Him, and He is in them. ©
Thirdly, their 'I'ness comes to an end. So they dwell, in Him.
Now a guestion arises here that it might mean, the Lord is
not the same, for all beings. He loves His devotees, more than ,
He loves other beings. So He is not just. The answer is, that the -
Lord has declared, ""Howsoever men approach Me, even so, do I
seek them"" (Gita 4/11). Therefore, though the Lord is the same,
and just, for all beings, yet it is the devotion of devotees, which ~
attracts the Lord, towards them. If He is not attracted towards
them, it means that He is ungrateful and unjust.
As a son, ts called worthy or unworthy, because of his
virtuous and evil actions, so a louse like insect, sucks blood,
instead of milk from the udders of a cow, and as with the same -
electricity, in a refrigerator water is frozen to ice, while in a heater
fire is burnt, because of their different characteristics. Similarly,
persons because of their different characteristics, have different
grasping capacity, to receive His grace. As a good conductor of
heat, or electricity, conducts heat or electricity, but some other
substances, do not conduct, at all. The defect does not lie, with
the source of energy, but with an instrument. Similarly, God's
grace or His sameness is equal, to all. But evil-doers, because
of their ignorance do not realize His grace, and equivalence. The
- Lord's grace, manifests itself among His devotees, according to
their devotion, while it is not revealed, among those, who have
no devotion, and who are non-believers. — .
It means, that men because of their worldly attachment, think
that they are worldly. If they start worshipping the Lord, their
"
1169,"1114 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter9 ~
attachment is wiped out and they start feeling, that they are in

God and God is in them. Actually, they are ever in God and

God is ever, in them, but the reality, is veiled by attachment.

The Lord, has used the term 'Ye' (who), which means, that
whosoever worships Him with devotion, isin Him and He isin =~
His devotee; he may be of any caste, creed, colour and country etc.

Appendix—‘Samo’ hath sarvabhiitesu’—A man (the self) may :
or may not dedicate (offer) his actions and objects to God, it
does not make any difference in God. He ever remains the
same. The Lord is not at all touched by any particular ‘Varna’

(order of life), particular 4Srama (stage of life), particular caste, -
particular action and particular ability etc. Therefore a person
of every Varna, Asrama, Caste etc., can have an inclination to
Him, can be a devotee to Him and can attain Him. | oe

‘Na me dvesyo’sti na priyah’—From the view-point of God,
there is no one else besides Him, then how can the question
arise of His being hateful or dear to anyone? A man (the -
self) is bound by having attachment and aversion to good and
bad actions and their fruit; and by renouncing attachment and .
aversion, he is liberated viz., he attains salvation. Therefore only
the individual self, not God is bound and liberated. The self has
partiality; in God there is no partiality at all, He ever remains |
the same to all beings.

- In the eleventh verse of the fourth chapter the Lord
declared—‘ye yatha marh prapadyante tarmstathaiva bhajamyaham’, |
the same notion has been expressed here by the expression ‘ye
bhajanti tu mar bhaktyad mayi te tesu capyaham’. God pervades
all beings equally, He has no partiality. But those who worship
God with devotion, they are in God and God is in them viz.,

God is specially revealed in them. As in the earth, water pervades
everywhere, but it is specially revealed in a well, similarly God
in spite of pervading the entire universe, is specially revealed
in devotees. This speciality is the fruit of God’s grace because |
"
1170,"Verse 29] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1115 -
devotees worship God with wholehearted devotion. As ghee
(clarified butter) present in the body of the cow, is of no use
to the cow, but the ghee extracted from her milk (curd) is of
use to her, similarly people are not purged oftheir sins by |
God merely by His pervasion in the entire universe but only
those, who have an inclination to God and worship.Him with
devotion, are purged of their sins.* Common people in spite of
being within God, don’t behold Him, but devotees behold God
everywhere (Gita 6/30). Devotees love God and God loves His
devotees—‘priyo hi jianino’tyarthamaham sa ca mama priyah’
(Gita 7/17). Therefore the devotees are in God and God is in :
devotees—‘mayi te tesu capyaham’. It means that there is no
partiality in God but the people who have disinclination for God,
have developed partiality. | : -
In essence (reality) God is ‘samo’harh sarvabhittesu’—
(I am the same to all beings); but the devotees realize “mayi te
tesu capyaham’—(they are in Me and I am in them). It means -
_ that though the Lord equally pervades all beings, yet only the
devotees realize this fact; other beings don’t realize it. In fact -
this power of realization has been bestowed upon. people by God
only. The only duty of a man is to turn towards God.
In Ramacaritamanasa it is mentioned— |
satav4 sama mohi maya jaga dekha .
: motem . samta =adhika kari = IlIekha
(Manasa, Aranya 36/2)
It means that God equally pervades all beings, He equally
loves them, equally showers His grace on them and has very
close intimacy with them but His love, grace and intimacy etc.,
specially appear in devotees. ‘These special traits are bestowed
upon devotees by His grace and by God only, when devotees
love God. Other people don’t get engrossed (absorbed) in God
* sanamukha hoi jiva mohi jabahimh
janma koti agha nasahim tabahim (Manasa 5/44/1)
"
1171,"1116 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter9 -
and they don’t love Him so much as devotees do. Therefore
devotees are also loving to God. The natural love between God
and a devotee has been mentioned by the expression, ‘mayi te
tesu capyaham’ (devotees are in Me and I am in them). :

Even if the vilest sinner worships Me with exclusive devotion, _
he should be considered a saint, for he has rightly resolved to be
My devotee. 30 :
Comment:— | -
(If a multimillionaire says, that he will help anyone, whosoever
seeks his help with money, his charity will be testified when he ~
actually helps the man who is his enemy. To prove the veracity of
His statement here, the Lord first mentions the vilest sinner. ]
""Api cet'—In the seventh chapter, the Lord declares, “Evil- |
doers do not worship Me"" (7/15) but here He declares, ""The
vilest sinners worship Me."" There seems, to be a contradiction
in these two statements. To remove this doubt, the Lord has used |
the terms 'Api cet’ (even if). It means, that in the seventh chapter,
the Lord has described their evil nature. Swayed by that nature,
they generally do not take refuge in God. But it does not mean,
that there is any restriction imposed by the Lord upon the sinners,
that they should not worship, Him. If they want to worship Him,
they can. The Lord, has no ill-will against, any being.
‘Suduracaro bhajate mam ananyabhak'—Even the sinners
of the worst conduct, by worshipping the Lord with exclusive
"
1172,"Verse 30] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 117i
devotion, attain salvation. Even, at present, sins may be committed
sometimes by them, because of their past influences. But, they
are firmly determined with exclusive devotion, to attain the Lord. .
Now, they do not aim at riches, honour, respect, happiness and
comforts etc. Their only aim, is exclusive devotion.
Now a question arises, how the vilest sinner can worship, |
the Lord. Thé answer is that, there can be several reasons: |
(i) When, in adversity, he gets no worldly support from any
quarter, he surrenders himself, to the Lord. |
(ii) The atmosphere and the company of saints convert him. /
(iii) Any past virtuous influence, may be aroused somehow :
or the other, as was aroused in Balmiki, Ajamila and Sadana
the butcher etc., who were converted, into devotees though they
were sinners. -
(iv) If a person, escapes some mortal danger somehow or
the other, he may start believing in the Lord's, singular power.
(v) By beholding saints and by the grace of saints, like
Valmiki and Ajamila, may start worshipping the Lord. .
. Several thieves, robbers, murderers and other vilest sinners,
became devout devotees, of the Lord.
Now a doubt arises, how can the vilest sinner worship the Lord,
continuously, when even the devotees, who have been engaged
in the worship of God for several years, cannot worship Him |
continuously. Here, importance has been attached, to exclusive |
and undivided devotion, rather than continuous devotion. As a
chaste wife, has her relationship only with her husband, that _
sinner has his affinity, only with God.
‘Ananyabhak'—A person, can have exclusive devotion, by
admitting his relationship with the Lord i.e., by changing his
egoism. He should admit, that He is the Lord's and the Lord
is his. He is more purified, by changing his egoism, than by
performing action, such as sacrifice, charity, penance and chanting
"
1173,"1118 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 9 |
the Lord's name etc. | | |

There are three factors in. connection with, changing
egoism:— | - ae a |

(i) To root it out:—A devotee, following the Discipline of
Knowledge, realizes that his self is different from egoism, andso:.
he remains established in the self. Thus, his ego is eliminated.

| (ii) To purify it:-—By following the Discipline of Action, a
devotee discharges his duty for others, without expecting any
fruit for his duty. For example, a son should discharge his duty
towards his father, without bothering whether the father treats him
as a son or not, or whether he troubles him. He should discharge -
his duty under all circumstances, without laying any claim on
him. He should not expect his father, to be favourable to him.
He should cherish no desire, for his own comfort or gain. Thus, _
having no desire of his own, his egoism is purified.

(iii) To change it:—In the Discipline of Devotion, ego is
changed. For example—a chaste wife by changing her ego, :
becomes only of her husband. She regards her husband's house,
as hers, his Gotra as hers, and she does not regard her relation -
with parents, in-laws and children. But she does serve all of
them, for the sake of her husband. Similarly, the ego of a devotee
changes. By following the Discipline of Devotion, just like a chaste

. wife, who becomes only her husband's, a devotee becomes God's
and only God becomes his. Thus, he changes his egoism. This
change of egoism, is denoted by the expression, 'Ananyabhak'.

| 'Sadhureva sa mantavyah'—He should be considered a saint.
This is the Lord's, special behest. Though he does not possess
all the virtues of a saint, yet he should be regarded as a saint,
because he has admitted that he is only God's and only God is his.
Thus by changing his egoism, he will become a saint, in no time.

Now the question arises why the. Lord has to say, that he
should be considered a saint. The answer is, that generally, people
judge a man by his actions. Where saintliness is not manifest,
"
1174,"Verse 30] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1119
and some trace of poor conduct is observed, then only it is said,
that he should be considered a saint. With change of ego, he has
accepted himself as God's. Therefore, his feelings and conduct
will become pure, in no time. So, the Lord says, that such a : |
person should be considered, a saint. :
A man is a devout devotee, but if any day, he is seen with
a prostitute, people regard him as immoral, though he may have |
gone there to reform her. Similarly, a sinner, may be regarded
religious-minded and virtuous, if he is seen by people, counting
the beads of a rosary, on the bank of the Ganges. Worldly people,
generally, view actions of other people. But the Lord instead of :
paying heed to their actions, pays attention to their, feelings. .
'‘Samyagvyavasito hi sah'—In the second chapter of the Gita
in connection with the Discipline of Action, the Lord says that a
in this path the intellect is determinate, while here He says
that, he himself has nghtly resolved. There, the determination
is by intellect, while here he himself is determined. Whatever, :
is determinded by one-self is permanent, while that what is
determined by intellect, is shortlived, because intellect can be
attracted towards worldly pleasures etc., when one does not live :
in spiritual atmosphere, as that of listening to divine discourses,
or studying the scriptures. a
As a girl, after her marriage changes her egoism, and becomes
her husband's and she even without making any effort, always
remembers that she is her husband's, a devotee, after becoming |
the Lord's once, becomes His, forever, because he has rightly so
resolved. So the Lord says, that he should be considered, a saint. |
By doing so, he speedily becomes virtuous (Gita 9/31).
A person, may be evil and a sinner so long as, he has a
disinclination for the Lord, but when he has an inclination for
the Lord, by having exclusive devotion to Him, all his evils and
sins, are rooted out.
Appendix—In Jnanayoga and Karmayoga there is predominance
of intellect “esa te’bhihita sankhye buddhiryoge tvimarh $mu’
"
1175,"1120 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA ——s«[Chapter9
(Gita 2/39). Therefore the intellect of a Jianayogi and a Karmayogi
| is determinate ‘vyavasayatmika buddhirekeha’ (Gita 2/41),
‘vyavasayatmika buddhih’ (Gita 2/44). But in Bhaktiyoga there
is predominance of one’s own, therefore a devotee himself is :
determined viz., he has nghtly resolved—‘Samyagvyavasito hi sah’.
Whatever is determined by mind and intellect, can be forgotten
but whatever is determined by the self, can’t be forgotten. The
reason is that the mind and intellect don’t stay with us always,
in sound sleep we realize that they don’t stay with us viz., we
lack them, but the self ever exists. Whatever happens in the self,
that remains permanent. Therefore the acceptance ‘I am God’s
and God is mine’ is one’s own, not of the mind and intellect.
| Once there is this acceptance, then it does not change into non-
acceptance because the self, at the root being a fragment of -
God, is inseparable from God. But by mistake the self accepts
its affinity with Prakrti (Gita 15/7). Therefore in fact only the
mistake is rectified. As soon as the mistake is rectified, the -
eternal union with God is naturally manifested ‘nasto mohah
smrtirlabdha’ (Gita 18/73). The acceptance of affinity with others. ;
was the mistake, it was the delusion.

and pure because, being a portion of the Lord, he is virtuous but
"
1176,"Verse 31] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1121 a
by having his affinity with the world, he became a sinner, which
was a transitory phase of his life. As soon as, he changes his
egoism and becomes God's, his affinity with thé world is wiped
out, and he realizes that he is virtuous, because all the evils are
the product of attaching importance, to the world. But, as soon .
as, a striver attaches importance only to God, rather than to the
world, he becomes virtuous. So long as, he has sinful feelings, he |
cannot resolve, that he is God's—this is correct. But it does not
mean, that a past sinner cannot thus resolve. Being a fragment of
God, he is ever sinless. But due to his attachment to the world,
sins visit him. In case, he starts hating sins and resolves, that
he has to adore God only, he can be instantly, virtuous. In ego, -
where there is desire, for the world, there is inclination to God,
also. If this inclination to God is strengthened, desire for the
world, is wiped out and God-realization takes no time. _
It is a rule, that if a man changes his egoism, his actions ;
are automatically changed. If a man, by performing virtuous
actions, wants to be virtuous, it will take a long time. But, if he -
changes his egoism he will become virtuous and his actions will
change, automatically. Similarly if a sinner, changes his egoism
and admits that he is God's and God is his, he speedily becomes
virtuous. It means, that when man desires worldly pleasures, |
by having an affinity of ‘ness and 'Mineness', with the body
and the world, he becomes full of desires (Gita 2/43) but when
by renouncing his affinity with the world, he realizes his real
affinity, with the Lord, he becomes virtuous. | -
Generally, people have a misconception, that a man becomes:
truthful by speaking the truth, and a thief by committing theft.
But this is not true. When a man accepts himself as truthful,
then he always speaks the truth, and by speaking the truth, his |
spirit of truthfulness, is strengthened. Similar is the case, with a
thief. It proves, that as doer, so his activities, and his activities
"
1177,"1122 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 9 -
strengthen, his assumption “I am truthful or I am a thief.""
_ Jt means, that as a person is, so are his actions. When even a
| sinner, becomes God's, not worldly, his actions are, virtuous. |
: 'SaSvacchantim nigacchati'—One who through spiritual .
activities, tries to become virtuous, can acquire enjoyment and
prosperity, due to his latent desire for these objects. But he can
not attain, everlasting peace. When the vilest sinner, changes
his egoism and becomes the Lord's, he cannot have desires and
cannot attach importance, to the unreal. So, he attains lasting peace.
Secondly, being a portion of the Lord, he possesses lasting |
peace, but by having his affinity with the world he cannot :
realize, that lasting peace. Only by having his affinity with the |
Lord, he realizes that lasting peace. .
‘Kaunteya pratijanihi na me bhaktah pranasyati'—Here, the -
Lord asks Arjuna to promise; and He Himself does not promise.
The reason is, that a promise of the Lord, can be broken but one
made by a devotee, is maintained by the Lord. As Lord Krsna's
oath, of not holding a weapon, is broken by Him, because His
devotee, Bhisma swears that he will force Him, to hold a weapon.
The Lord declares, ""My devotee never falls."" By this
declaration, He means to say that when a person has total inclination,
to God, he has not the least possibility, to fall. The reason is,
that it was his assumed affinity with the body, which led him to
a fall. When he, having renounced this affinity has an exclusive
inclination to God, how can there be any possibility, of his fall?
Now a doubt arises, that when even the vilest sinner can
become virtuous, a virtuous person can also become, a vile sinner
again. But Lord Krsna declares, that a devotee can never fall
1.€., he cannot become a sinner again. It shows that the Lord is
not only just, but also gracious. It is His grace, which enables
a devotee never to fall.
_ Appendix—<As a patient gets connected with the physician,
similarly when a man believes in his weakness and in the Lord’s
omnipotence, then he gets connected with God. It means that

1178,"Verse 31] ‘SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1123
when a man is distraught with the worldly sufferings and finds
himself helpless (weak) in getting rid of them, and has a belief |
in God, that by the omnipotent God’s grace, he can get rid of
this weakness and can escape the worldly sufferings, then he |
immediately becomes a devotee—‘ksiprarmh bhavati dharmatma’. If
a hungry person gets food, will he delay in taking that food?
~ So long as a man perceives some power, ability and speciality 7
in him, he can’t be ‘ananyabhak’ (with exclusive devotion). He
worships God with exclusive devotion only, when he finds no
helping hand to remove his sufferings. By having exclusive
devotion he becomes ‘dharmatma’ (virtuous) viz., a devotee .
of God a |
A devotee has no downfall because he depends on God viz.., |
_ his means and end both are only God, he has no power of his /
own but he depends totally on God’s power. Here a doubt may
arise, if a devotee has no downfall, then why did the Lord say
to Arjuna in the eighteenth chapter “If from egoism, thou wilt
not listen to Me, thou shalt perish’—‘Atha cettvamahankaranna |
Srosyasi vinanksyasi’ (18/58) while the Lord regards him as His |
devotee ‘bhakto’si me sakhi ceti’ (Gita 4/3). The clarification is 7
that a devotee can perish only, when he instead of depending on
God, depends on egoism—‘ahankaranna srosyasi’. So long as he _
depends on God, he can’t have a downfall viz., can’t perish. —
| A devotee is like a child and a Jani is like a grown up boy.
As a mother loves all her sons equally, yet she looks after the |
child specially, not the grown up sons. The reason is that the
child totally depends on its mother, therefore it needs more care
than the grown up sons need. Similarly the Lord takes special
care of His devotee who depends on Him and He provides him
gain and security—‘yogaksemarh vahamyaham’ (Gita 9/22). But
who will provide gain and security to a Jnani? Therefore a striver
following the discipline of knowledge can fall from Yoga but a
devotee can’t fall from Yoga. :
The gods such as Brahma etc., say to the Lord—

(9/30). But 'Papayonayah’ (born of the womb of sin), are those
who were sinners in the previous birth, and are born of sinful

such as, kindness, forgiveness, generosity etc., the beings, from

Actually, a man becomes impure, by having a disinclination
for the Lord. As coal, loses its lustre and becomes black, after |
leaving a fire and brightens again in the fire, the soul being a ""
portion of the Lord, becomes impure by losing its lustre due to
its disinclination from the Lord, but when it has inclination for
the Lord, its impurity is wiped out, and it becomes so pure, that |
- the Lord makes soul a jewel of His crown.
Capability and incapability, are judged in worldly life. But,
in having affinity with God, these are not significant. Only he, —
who desires Him from his heart, is most capable, as for as, the
Lord is concerned. For instance, a child serves his mother well,
she loves it. Another child, does nothing but wails and invokes
the mother's help, feeling afflicted. The mother, does not care,
that it does nothing, how she should take the child in her lap.
She can't bear affliction. Her heart melts. She takes the child into :
* Cowherdesses, cows, trees, animals, snakes and other foolish creatures by
having exclusive devotion suddenly attained Me (Srimadbhi. 11/12/8).
"
1182,"Verse 32] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1127 -
her lap, without caring. for its purity or impurity. Similarly, when
a sinful man possessing the worst conduct, being afflicted, wails
and invokes God, God's heart melts and He accepts him as His,
and loves him without paying attention, to his sinful conduct. It
proves, that the present sins of a person who becomes a devotee, -
are not obstacles to God-realization. Then, how can sins of previous
birth, be an obstacle, because these can bear fruit in the form
of birth in low wombs, and under unfavourable circumstances?
Only, they cannot create an obstacle, in adoration of God.

By the term womanfolk, He means that women of all castes,
creeds, colours, classes, countries etc., by taking refuge in Him,
become pure and attain Him. Devahiti, Sabari, Kunti, Draupadi, -
Vraja's cowherdesses of the past, and Mira, Karamaiti, Karamabai,
Phiilibai of the present, are women-devotees. Similarly, Samadhi ,
and Tuladhara, among Vaisyas and Vidura, Safijaya and Nisadaraja _
Guha, among Siidras, are examples of devotees. | ,

The term 'Papayonayah’' (born of the womb of sin), is not an
adjective qualifying womanfolk, Vaisyas and Siidras. If it qualifies ;
womanfolk, it is unjustified, because women of the three castes
Brahmana, Ksatriya and Vaisya, are authorized to perform Vedic
actions, such as oblation etc., with their husbands.

The Lord, has mentioned womanfolk separately, besides the
four castes. It means that they independently also, by taking
refuge in Him, can attain Him. So, they should take refuge only
in Him, without seeking help of any individual.

If it qualifies Vaisyas, it is also unjustified because, they are
fully authorized to study the Vedas and perform Vedic actions,
such as oblation etc.*

If it qualifies Siidras, it is also not reasonable, because they
are included, among the people of the four castes. So, only people

-* Those possessing good conductare born as Brahmanas, Ksatriyas and Vaisyas
but those of bad conduct are born of the wombs of bitches, pigs and pariahs.
"
1183,"1128 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 9 -
of inferior birth such as Yavana, Hina and Khasa etc., should
be included, among those born of a womb of sin. There is no
restriction, for any being to have an inclination to Him, because
he is an integral part of Him. Moreover, animals, birds, trees and
plants etc., can also be included among those, even thought they -
have no discrimination to move towards Him, but, if because of
past influence or any other reason, they have an inclination for
Him, they can become deVotees, like 'Gajendra’, the elephant
and 'Jatayu', the bird.
Feelings, play a more important role, than birth, 1n the field -
of spiritualism. A man, born in a high family or caste, may be
proud of his birth, because of his affinity with the body. But,
actually he, being a fraction of the Lord, is His, and is different
from a body. So, when he renounces his affinity with the body, -
he becomes one with Him, or attains Him. Similarly, a ‘Jiva'
is not converted into Brahma. But Brahma Himself realizes, .
Brahma. In Brahma, there is never such assumption—""I am
the embodied soul,"" while an embodied soul, is not Brahma.
Due to affinity with vital force, a being, is called a ‘Jiva’. In ”
Brahma, there is no such vital force. Therefore, Brahma realizes
Brahma. It means, 'I am limited'—this feeling is being destroyed
and Brahma is realized.
A man, is different from the body. So long as, he identifies
himself with a body, he remains, a slave to this body, which is
an instrument made of flesh and bones, and to produce excrement |
and urine. This identification with a body, is the result of lack
of discrimination. Without discrimination, a man can follow,
neither the Discipline of Devotion, nor that of Action. So a
devotee, who wants to attain devotion or salvation, should have
a clear conception, that he is different from his body. He has
identity with the Lord, while the body has its identity, with the
world. So long as, he identifies himself with the body, he does
not deserve, either devotion or knowledge. A devotee through
"
1184,"Verse 33] | SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1129 -
devotion, remains engrossed in the Lord and so automatically, he
has no identity with body and thus sex, caste, creed and colour
etc., do not remain obstacles, to God-realization. Similarly, a
person following the Discipline of Knowledge, by applying his
discrimination, realizes that he is different from the body, and -
thus he also attains the Lord and any distinction of caste, creed,
colour, class and country etc., does not debar, a devotee from _
realizing God. a Oo
Appendix—These who don’t take refuge in others besides
God, their such exclusive refuge (dependence) here has been
called ‘vyapaéraya’ viz., special refuge in God. | |
The sinner in this birth is more guilty than the sinner of :
the previous birth. Therefore the Lord first (in the thirtieth and |
thirty first verses) mentions the sinner of this birth and now in
this verse He mentions the sinner of the previous birth—‘ye’ pi -
syuh papayonayah’. | | | |

and unhappy body, do continually worship Me. 33 __
Comment:— |
""Kirh punarbrahmanah punya bhakt4 rajarsayastatha'— When,
even the vilest sinners and beings born of the womb of sin, as
well as womenfolk, Vaisyas and Sidras by taking refuge in
Him; attain Him, no wonder then, that the holy Brahmanas and
Ksatriyas by taking refuge in Him should attain Him 1.e., they
"
1185,"1130 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter9 -
will attain Him, certainly. = |
The term 'Punya' (holy), used here is antonym to the term
‘Duracarr (sinner), used in the thirtieth verse, while the term
‘Brahmanah’ is antonym to the term 'Papayonayah’', used in the
thirty-second verse. It means, that Brahmanas are holy, both by ~
actions and birth. Similarly, for the Ksatriyas the terms 'Rs1’
(saint) and 'raja’ (royal), have been used to denote their purity
of birth and actions. ,
‘The term 'Bhaktah’, has been used to emphasize the fact, |
that those Brahmanas and Ksatriyas having a virtuous conduct,
in the previous birth, as well as in this birth, through devotion
attain Him, without any doubt. Moreover, 'Punya brahmanah' and -
‘Rajarsayah’, these two terms, denote external purity of actions .
and birth, while ‘Bhaktah' denotes internal purity, because a
devotee takes refuge in the Lord, from his heart. -
‘Anityamasukharm lokamimath prapya bhajasva mam'—This
human birth, is the last of all births, because it destroys all the
innumerable, future births. A man, can be a source of bliss to
the Lord Himself, by being an ardent devotee. This birth is
sacred, but is transient. The body may die any moment. So, a -
man should attain salvation, as soon as possible. This body is
joyless, there is no happiness in it. In the: fifteenth verse of the
eighth chapter it has been called, the 'abode of pain’. Therefore,
a man should not hanker after worldly pleasures, during this
human life and waste his precious time. :
Here, the expression 'Imarh lokam’, stands for human body, :
of whitch the only aim is God-realization, as according to the
ordinance of the Lord, this is the last of all births. If, in this life
he does not attain God, he misses a golden opportunity, which
will not be available to him, in other species. So He advises men
to worship Him, without aiming at perishable objects and without
attaching any value to them. The Lord's exhorting a devotee, to
worship Him does not mean, that this worship will be of any
benefit to the Lord, it will benefit the devotee only. —
"
1186,"Verse 33] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1131 -
_ The man (soul), being a fraction of the Lord, is pure, sentient
and imperishable. Then, by having affinity with transient evils,
how can he himself be sinful and how can the Lord regard Him, -
as sinful? Being attached to the transient body and the world, he
gets engaged in evils and sins. So, as soon as, he renounces that
affinity of ''ness and 'Mineness' with the body and the world,
he comes to know that he is pure. Similarly, animals, birds and
pariah etc., born of the womb of. sin, become free from ‘sinful
actions performed, in the previous birth. So, they by taking refuge |
in the Lord, can also attain Him. Thus the Lord, has referred to .
sinners of this birth and of the previous birth. ,
Then, the Lord describes, those who are mediocre. First, He
talks about women, including, those of Brahmanas and Ksatriyas.
Then, He talks about the twice-born viz., Vaigyas, who are not so -
virtuous, as Brahmanas and Ksatriyas. Then, He describes, Siidras
who are inferior to the twice-born viz., Vaisyas. So, He declares, |
that even women, Vaiéyas, and Siidras taking refuge in Him,
attain Him. Thus there is no wonder that those Brahmanas and
Ksatriyas, who are holy by birth and actions, should attain Him. :
The Lord here (9/30—33) has mentioned seven kinds of
persons even they can seek devotion to God. They are, the vilest
sinners, those born of a womb of sin, womenfolk, Vaigyas, Siidras,
Brahmanas and Ksatriyas. Lord Krsna, should have described the
holy Brahmana or Ksatriya, first, but first of all, He mentions
the vilest sinner. The reason is, that the lower a person, the more
loving he is to the Lord, because he is not proud, of his virtues.
He naturally, considers himself lower and inferior. So the Lord,
names him first. In the twelfth chapter also, He declares that
devotees who have attained perfection, are dear to Him while,
strivers, are extremely dear to Him (Gita 12/13—20).
| Here, a point needs attention. The Lord, has divided persons,
into seven categories according to their caste, (Brahmana, Ksatriya,
Vaisya and Sidra); conduct, (vilest sinner and that born of
"
1187,"1132 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter9 ~
womb of sin) and sex (womanfolk), to emphasize the fact, that
beings belonging to any caste, having any sort of conduct and
of any sex, by, worshipping God, can attain Him as they are all
fractions of God. They have become extraordinary, not because
of their caste, conduct and sex, but because of their devotion, -
to the Lord.
In the seventh chapter, the Lord has divided devotees into
four groups according to their attitudes, and here He has divided
them into seven groups according to their caste, conduct and |
sex, in order to explain that all devotees, without any distinction
of caste, creed, conduct and sex etc., are deserving of God- .
realization. So, no one should lose heart, as far as devotion and -
God-realization, are concerned. If they have a disinclination for
Him. So they themselves can develop inclination for Him as
well. They are free to and capable of doing so. -
Appendix—The Lord from the thirtieth verse to the thirty-
third verse mentioned seven kinds of persons who are qualified
(eligible) for devotion and God-realization—they are the vilest
sinners of this birth, sinners of the previous birth, womenfolk,
Vaisyas, Sudras, Brahmanas and Ksatriyas. No person remains out -
of these seven kinds of persons. Every human being is eligible
for God-realization without any distinction of his birth, caste;
and even if he committed so many sins in his previous birth.
Brahmana, Ksatriya, Vaisya and Sadra—all the four Varnas
have been mentioned in this verse. Anyone may not think that
only men have been included, so the Lord has also mentioned |
the womenfolk. The persons such as Yavana, Hina, Khasa etc.,
who are below the people of the four Varnas in rank have been
included in ‘Papayoni’ (born of sinful wombs). Besides human
beings other beings (birds and beasts etc.,) can also be included
in ‘Papayoni’ because every living being is a fragment of God
and therefore there is no bar for anyone from the side of God
that one can’t turn towards God.
He who is committing sins at present is a “duracari’ and
"
1188,"Verse 33] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1133 -

he who because of being a sinner in the previous birth, is born

of sinful womb is a ‘Papayoni’. It-means that even the vilest .

sinner and the one born of the most sinful womb, is entitled to

God-realization. Therefore a man by taking into consideration

his caste and conduct, should not get disappointed as far as a

God-realization is concerned. Caste and conduct are transient

and unreal but a man’s affinity with God is eternal and real.

Therefore God accepts the relationship of devotion, not of caste

and conduct—

kaha raghupati sunu bhamini bata, manau eka bhagati kara nata

jati pati kula dharma baRa&i, dhana bala parijana guna caturai -

bhagati hina nara sohai kaisaé, binu jala barida dekhia jaisa -
(Manasa, Aranya. 35/2-3)

_ The worldly people see the outward caste, conduct, rather .
than the inward reality; but God sees the reality that a man (the -
self) is His fragment.

In the sixteenth verse of the seventh chapter, the Lord |
according to the inner feelings of devotees, has divided them
into four kinds—‘Artharthi’ (seeker of wealth) ‘Arta’ (afflicted),
‘Jijnasu’ (seeker of knowledge) and ‘Jnani’ (wise devotee); and -
here according to their outward assumption (caste and conduct)
from the worldly point of view, He has mentioned seven kinds.
In the seventh chapter there is description of those devotees who
are engaged in the worship of God and here is the description of
those persons who can divert themselves towards God. It means
that in spite of the distinction of ‘Varna’ (order of life), ‘Asrama’
(stage of life), dress, castes and sects etc., all the people can
become devotees of these four kinds—artharthi, arta, jijnasu and
jnani and can attain God. As far as God-realization is concerned,
in it all are one, no one is low (inferior) or high (superior). A
being may be born of any womb, he is neither disqualified for
God-realization, nor was, nor will be nor can be disqualified.
“Kim punarbrahmanah punya bhakta rajarsayastatha’—-The
purpose of using the term “bhaktah’ in the middle of the half
"
1189,"1134 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 9 -
verse is that there is not the glory of the holy Brahmanas and
Ksatriya-saints but there is glory of their devotion. It means
that the Lord is neither (envious of) impartial to sinners of the
worst conduct and to these who are born of sinful wombs nor
He is partial to the holy Brahmanas and Ksatriya saints. He is :
the same to all beings (Gita 9/29). But he who worships God
with love (devotion), he may be of any region, guise, varna,
asrama, Caste, creed etc., he has his intimate relationship with
God—‘mayi te tesu capyaham’ (Gita 9/29). Therefore the sinners
of the worst conduct, these born of sinful wombs, womenfolk,
Vaisgyas, Siidtas, Brahmanas and Ksatriya, all the seven become —
one as far as devotion is concerned, no difference remains in them. -
Therefore the Lord orders Arjuna to worship Him—‘bhajasva
mam’. ‘Bhajana’ (worship) means—to be inclined to God, to |
love God (to have one’s ownship with God) and to aim at God- -
realization. To render service to others by regarding them as the
manifestation of God, to offer things to others in disinterested
manner and to help the needy and scarcity-stricken people—this
is also worship. 7

‘Anityamasukham lokamimar prapya bhajasva mam’—-Having -
obtained the transient and joyless human life viz., we may live
alive and enjoy pleasures—having renounced such desires,
we should worship God. The reason is that there is no joy in
the world, there is mere illusion of joy. Similarly there is the
illusion of living. We are actually not living but we are dying
every moment.

In the twenty-ninth verse of this chapter the Lord declared,
“Those who worship Me with devotion, are in Me and I am also
in them.” Therefore here Lord Krsna orders Arjuna to worship
Him—‘bhajasva mam’. |

Link:—Lord Krsna, from the twenty-ninth to the thirty-third
verses, has described devotion and worship. How to | worship
Him, is made clear, in the next verse. |

Me, thus making yourself steadfast in Me, and entirely surrendering

to Me, you will, reach Me. 34 | : ' .

Comment:— : |
[The Lord discloses His secret to His devotee Arjuna who

is devoid of a carping spirit, and who has devotion for Him.] -
'Madbhaktah'—Lord Krsna, asks Arjuna, to be devoted to

Him. He should realize his real relationship with Him, that he is ”

His and He is his. He should renounce, the assumed relationship, _

that he belongs to a particular caste, creed and country etc.

- ""Manmana bhava'—The mind, is fixed on a person or a

object, that a person loves and likes. So Lord Krsna, reminds

Arjuna that his affinity with Him is eternal, because he is His

fraction. The Lord cannot forget this affinity, but Arjuna can -

forget it. So He exhorts him, to fix his mind on Him, by loving

and liking Him. oO |
'Madyaji'—The Lord, asks him to perform all actions, such

as eating, drinking, sleeping, moving and his profession etc., as

an adoration to Him. |
""Mam namaskuru'—However, agreeable or disagreeable,

an incident may happen to a devotee and he may be aware of

it through his senses, but to him in reality, it is divine grace,

only. If something very unfavourable happens, the devotee should

regard it as a special divine grace, as it is not according to the

devotee's own will, but, it is according to Lord's own sweet will.

If something favourable happens, with what proportion of the

devotee's consent? In that proportion, the divine grace is lesser. But

in an unfavourable incident, the devotee should feel highly blissful,

as it is destined, purely by God. It means, that a devotee should
"
1191,"1136 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter9

bow to Him and His will. He should remain satisfied and happy,

in favourable and unfavourable circumstances, by regarding these

as the Lord's gift, because He is all merciful and is a disinterested

friend, of all beings. Nothing, can happen against, His will. ;
A devotee surrenders himself to the Lord, without having

any desire.of his own and always remains satisfied with, what

the Lord does; and he addresses the Lord, ""O Lord! In which

birth, in what circumstances, whatever action helplessly, I have

done; to neutralize those actions, and make me pure, whatever

dispensation, you are making, I shall accept with much pleasure,

because, they are conducive to my salvation. Why should I :

brood over them?” Thus, he thinks, that whatever is done by

Him, is for his welfare. | | .
'Mamevaisyasi yuktvaivamatmanam matparayanah'—The -

term, 'Madbhaktah’ signifies, self-surrender, the term ‘Manmana’

signifies, surrender of the inner sense and 'Madyajr signifies, that

all his activities become worship-material. The expression 'Marn

namaskuru' signifies, surrender of the body at the Lord's feet. It

means, that a devotee, by surrendering his actions, things, body,

mind and himself to the Lord, attains Him. | -
The expression 'Yuktvaivamatmanam’' means, that a devotee

by changing his egoism, that he is only the Lord's, surrenders

himself to the Lord. In that case, all the actions performed with

senses, mind and intellect etc., will be directed towards Him and

he will desire nothing else, besides the Lord. By doing so, he |

will attain God, without any doubt.
The term 'Matparayanah’ means, that he should become a

puppet in the hands of the Lord, by wholly depending on Him.

He should have, not even a trace of thought to do anything,

against, the Lord's will.
(1) A devotee, by fixing his mind on Him, by being devoted

to Him, by adoring Him, and by bowing down to Him, surrenders
"
1192,"Verse 34] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1137 :
himself to Him. Out of these four factors, the most important is,
that he becomes a devotee of the Lord and then all the perishable
worldly things to which he was attached, become His. Thus a
devotee, should admit the reality, that he is only the Lord's. Thus
his 'mineness' is gone. This notion of mineness, was wrong. It -
is corrected. | | | |
(2) A man, by identifying himself with a body and the world,
cannot know the reality, about them. If he as a spectator, by
isolating himself from them, beholds them, he comes to know
the reality, that he, as a portion of the Lord is eternal, while
they are perishable. But, those who surrender themselves to
God and become one with Him, without having any separate :
entity of their own, know the Lord. In them, not only 'I'ness
and 'mineness' are gone, but also there should be left not even .
a trace of these. : :
When, a man identifies himself with a body, he feels -
the pleasure and pain of the body as his own, and cannot
realize, that he is different from the body. Similarly, when
a man realizes, that being a portion of the Lord, he is one
with Him, he is not, at all affected, by any change, which
happens either, in the body or the world. His actions, are -
automatically performed by God's will. He becomes one with
the Lord. As Radhaji, is one with Lord Krsna, both of them
are one and the same, but to exchange love, the Lord has
manifested Himself, in two forms. This is His sport of union
and disunion. In their union, there is a feeling of disunion
and in their disunion, there is a feeling for union. Thus, union
and disunion strengthen each other, and in this process there
is enhancement of spiritual love, which cannot be, expressed
in words. This state of enhancement, of indescribable spiritual
love, 1s God-realization. :
Harmony of the Topic, in the Seventh and the Ninth Chapters—
At the beginning of the seventh chapter, Lord Krsna declared,
that He would teach Arjuna, knowledge (wisdom) with realization
"
1193,"1138 | SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 9
(real knowledge of manifest Divinity) (7/2). The flow of the
Lord's gospel, was interrupted when Arjuna, put questions at the
beginning of the eighth chapter. So, when the eighth chapter was
over, Lord Krsna, at the beginning of the ninth chapter, restarted
the same topic, of the seventh chapter Himself, by declaring, ""To .
you, who do not cavil, I shall now unfold the most profound
Knowledge with Realization” (Gita 9/1). The topic, which was
explained, in thirty verses in the seventh chapter, continued in |
thirty-four verses of the ninth chapter, and first eleven verses
of the tenth chapter. Arjuna was very much influenced by Lord
Krsna’s gospel, and so he recalls the Lord's glories, from the |
twelfth to the eighteenth verses, of the tenth chapter. It means, -
that the topic mentioned in the seventh chapter, has also been
explained in the ninth chapter. | : -
The topic, which was explained in the first verse of the _
seventh chapter by the terms, 'With the mind attached to Me’ in
brief, has been explained in detail, in the thirty-fourth verse of
the ninth chapter by the terms, 'Fix your mind on Me' etc.
In the second verse of the seventh chapter, the Lord declared,
""I shall unfold to you m full, this knowledge combined with -
realization, having known which, nothing else, remains to be
known."" The same statement, has been made by Him, in the
first verse of the ninth chapter, when He declares, ""I shall unfold
this knowledge with realization, by knowing which, you will
be released from evil."" By being released from evil, nothing
remains, to be known. Thus, the Lord unfolded the knowledge
with realization, and its fruit. :
In the third verse of the seventh chapter the Lord, declared,
“Among thousands of men, scarcely one strives for perfection,
and of those who strive, scarcely one knows Me, in truth."" Why
does, scarcely one know Him, in truth? The answer comes, in
the third verse of the ninth chapter, ""Men having no faith in
Dharma (Knowledge with Realization), failing to reach Me, whirl
in the path of mortal world.” ,
"
1194,"Verse 34] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1139 -

In the.sixth verse of the seventh chapter and in the eighteenth
verse of the ninth chapter, He declared, ""I am the origin and the
end, of the entire world.” oo

_ In the tenth verse of the seventh chapter, He declared, ""I
am the eternal seed of all beings."" In the eighteenth verse of the
ninth chapter He declared, ""I am the imperishable seed.""

In the twelfth verse of the seventh chapter, by declaring,
""Neither I exist in them, nor do they exist in Me"" the Lord
described in brief, the sovereign science, which has been described
in detail, in the fourth and fifth verses of the ninth chapter.

In the thirteenth verse of the seventh chapter, the Lord -
declared the whole of the creation, to be deluded by objects ;
evolved from the three modes of Nature, while in the eighth
verse of the ninth chapter, He declared the whole multitude of

_ beings helpless under the regime of Nature. a -

In the fourteenth verse of the seventh chapter, the Lord
declared, ""Those who take refuge in Me alone, cross this divine
illusion, of Mine."" In the twenty-second verse of the ninth chapter,

He declared, ""Those who worship Me alone, thinking of no one

else, who are ever devout, I provide gain and security."" -
_ In the fifteenth verse of the seventh chapter, He declared,

""The evil-doers, the deluded, do not worship Me"", while in the

eleventh verse of the ninth chapter He declared, ""Fools do not

know, My supreme nature.” |

Again, in the fifteenth verse of the seventh chapter, He
declared, “They have embraced the demoniac nature"" while
in the twelfth verse of the ninth chapter, He declared, ""Those
senseless persons have embraced a demoniacal nature.”

_ -What, in the sixteenth verse of the seventh chapter, has been
called ‘virtuous’, the same in the thirteenth verse of the ninth
chapter, has been called a ‘great soul’. :

In the seventh chapter from the sixteenth to the eighteenth
verses, there is description of four types of virtuous men, while
"
1195,"1140 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 9 -
in the ninth chapter from the thirtieth to the thirty-third verse,
there is explanation of seven types of devotees, according to
their caste, conduct and sex. 7 a
In the nineteenth verse of the seventh chapter He declared,
""The man of realization, realizes, that all this is God,"" while, _
in the nineteenth verse of the ninth chapter, He declared, ""I am
being and non-being, both.""
A devotee having a disinclination for the Lord, worships the :
gods either, because he wants his desires to be fulfilled by them,
or he does not know, the Lord in reality. In the twentieth verse
of the seventh chapter, there is a description of those whose
discrimination has been carried away by various desires, and so -
they worship other gods, while in the twenty-third verse of the
ninth chapter, there is description of those, who worship other -
gods, because they don't recognize (know) the Lord, in reality. -
In the twenty-third verse of the seventh chapter, there is
description of those who by worshipping other gods, craving for
some worldly fruit, gain perishable fruit, while in the twenty-first
verse of the ninth chapter, there is the description of those who
as a result of their deeds, enjoy celestial pleasures in heaven, -
and then return to this world of mortals, when their merits are
exhausted.
In the twenty-third verse of the seventh chapter, the Lord
declared, ""The worshippers of gods, attain the gods, whereas My
devotees, attain Me alone."" The same fact, has been pointed out,
in the twenty-fifth verse of the ninth chapter. |
In the first part of the twenty-fourth verse of the seventh
chapter, the Lord declared, ""Men of poor understanding think of
Me, the unmanifest, as having manifestation and take me as an
ordinary human being not knowing my supreme Nature” while,
in the first part of the eleventh verse of the ninth chapter, He
declared, ""Fools don't know My higher nature, as the Great Lord
of beings.” Similarly, in the second part of the twenty-fourth
verse of the seventh chapter, the Lord declared, ""Men of poor
"
1196,"Verse 34] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1141 ~
understanding don't know My supreme state, immutable and '
unsurpassed”, while in the second part of the eleventh verse of
the ninth chapter, He declared, ""Fools don't know My supreme
nature, as the great Lord of beings."" |

In the twenty-seventh verse of the seventh chapter, the 7
Lord said, ""All beings are subject to illusion at birth”, while,
the same fact has been pointed out by Him, in the third verse
of the ninth chapter, when He declared, ""Men return to the path
of the mortal world.""

In the thirtieth verse of the seventh chapter, the Lord has
laid special emphasis on the knowing Him in entirety while, in -
the thirty-fourth verse of the ninth chapter, He has laid special -
emphasis on the fact, that one should entirely depend on Him, -
(surrender one self to Him).

Appendix—lIn this verse the important point is ‘the change -
of ego’. A devotee changes his ego by accepting the fact ‘I am
God’s’ and connects the self with God. He instead of depending
on his spiritual practice, depends on God. Therefore he has not to
renounce attachment to the world, but it is naturally renounced.
The reason is that ‘Varna’ (order of life), ‘Asrama’ (stage of :
life), caste, ability, right (authority), action and qualities etc., to
which he is attached may be different but they are all transient,
they appear and disappear but affinity of God with the self is
not transient but it is beginningless, eternal and axiomatic.

- INTRODUCTION

In the seventh chapter, Lord Krsna while clarifying knowledge |
with realization actually He was unfolding the secrets of His heart.
But Arjuna put some questions, in between. So the Lord answered :
his questions and then reverted to the previous topic in the ninth oe
chapter, and concluded it, by advising exclusive surrender, to the ;
Lord. But He was not satisfied with what He had already said
to Arjuna. As a devotee wants to know of His glories in detail -
(Gita 10/18), He also wanted to say something secret to His
loving devotee, Arjuna. So, by His grace without being asked
by Arjuna, He starts the topic, in the tenth chapter.

yatte'ham priyamanaya vaksyami hitakamyaya
. The Blessed Lord said:

Once again, O mighty-armed, listen to My supreme word, which
I shall convey to you, who are so loving, and out of solicitude for
your welfare. 1 |
Comment:—

'Bhiiya eva'—The knowledge of glories of the Lord, promote
devotion. So the Lord by His grace, in the seventh chapter (from
"
1199,"1144 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 10 -
the 8th to the 12th verses) mentioned, His seventeen glories and

in the ninth chapter (from the 16th to 19th verses) mentioned His
thirty-seven glories. Here, in order to tell some more glories*

and to supplement the glory of devotion mentioned (in Gita 8/14

and 9/22, 34) the Lord uses the expression 'Bhiiya eva’ (Again “
verily) to explain His devotion in a special way.

'‘Srnu me paramam vacah'—The Lord wants to narrate His
supremacy and glories to Arjuna, because he is His devout :
devotee. So He asks him, to listen to His supreme word.

Secondly, whenever Lord Krsna wants to disclose His secret
to Arjuna, He uses such terms, as 'supreme words' etc.,; as in the -
third verse of the fourth chapter, he said, ""This secret is supreme""
because He who taught the immortal Yoga to the sun-god was
sitting before him and was driving his horses, and also, in the
sixty-fourth verse of the eighteenth chapter, He says to Arjuna, -
""Listen again to My supreme word"" and His supreme word is
“Surrendering all duties to Me, seek refuge in Me alone. I shall
liberate you from all sins; grieve not"" (Gita 18/66). Here, in this
context, the Lord says that diverse feelings of creatures, emanate
from Him alone and His devotees, such as the seven great seers, ;
four Sanaka etc., and fourteen Manus were born of His will i.e.,

He, is the root of all of them. a

While talking about knowledge (wisdom), in the thirteenth
chapter, He continues the same topic, in the fourteenth chapter;
similarly explaining the topic of knowledge with realization, in
the seventh and ninth chapters, He continues, it in the tenth
chapter. At the beginning of the fourteenth chapter He declares,
that He shall impart to him once more, supreme knowledge, the
best of all forms of knowledge, while at the beginning of the
tenth chapter here, He says to Arjuna to listen to His supreme
word, which means that in the Discipline of Knowledge, there

* In the tenth chapter the Lord has mentioned His forty-five glories from
the fourth to the sixth verses. :
"
1200,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI | 1145 -
is Predominance of discrimination, while in the Discipline ‘of
Devotion, there is predominance, of reverence and faith.

'Yatte'harh priyamanaya vaksyami hitakamyaya'—If a listener
has reverence and faith, in the speaker and the speaker has a:
feeling for the welfare of the listener, whatever he says, sinks
down in, the mind of the listener. Thus, the listener's devotion
to the Lord, grows. 7

Now, a doubt arises, that the Lord, again and again, has laid
emphasis on rooting out desires, but here, He Himself has a desire.
The clarification is, that when a person has desire for his pleasures
and prosperity etc., that is called a desire and is harmful. But when :
there is a desire to do good to others, that is not desire, that is
renunciation (1.e.,) the means, to root out a desire. Therefore, the -
Lord, teaches a lesson to the beings, that as He 1s engrossed, in the /
welfare of all beings, they should also have dealings with others,
for their welfare. By doing so, their desires are easily wiped out,
and they attain Him. ""Those who are engaged in the welfare of
all beings, come unto Me (Who is endowed with attributes)""
(Gita 12/4). ""Those who are actively engaged in the welfare of all -
beings, attain the Beatitude of Brahma"" (Gita 5/25).

Appendix—Arjuna, after coming to the battlefield, instead
of desiring victory, wants to attain salvation, therefore he has
been addressed as ‘mahabaho’. This vocative denotes Arjuna’s
superiority, ability to grasp the Lord’s gospel and his right to grasp it.

‘Paramam vacah’—The Lord’s word is ‘parama’ viz.,
supreme because it leads beings to salvation. The Gita is loving
and adorable to the entire universe because it enables the people
to attain salvation. |

“Vaksyami hitakamyaya’—Arjuna is a representative of all
beings and he wants to attain the highest good (bliss).* Therefore

* ‘yacchreyah syanniscitam bruhi tanme’ (Gita 2/7)

‘tadekarh vada niscitya yena Sreyo”’hamapnuyam’ (Gita 3/2)
“yacchreya etayorekam tanme bruhi suniscitam’ (Gita 5/1)
"
1201,"4146 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 10 ~
the Lord utters supreme word for the welfare of all the people.
There is no other good for human beings besides salvation. The
Lord’s utterance leads people to salvation and their aim is also
to attain salvation. Therefore the Lord’s utterances are imbued _
with the supreme good of human beings. No one can do as much -
good to mankind as God can— _
uma rama _ sama _ hita  jaga mahim,
guru. pitu matu  bandhu prabhu = nahim.
| '  (Manasa, Kiskindha 12/1)
There are differences of opinions as far as the utterances
of others are concerned, but the utterances of. the Lord are .
universal truth. The Lord is preaching the gospel of the Gita :
being established in Yoga*. Therefore His utterances are specially |
benedictory. What is God’s establishment in Yoga? Generally
God is the Supreme disinterested friend of all beings, but -
when a person keenly eager, takes refuge in Him, then a tide
of emotions for his welfare surges up in Lord’s mind—this |
is the Lord’s establishment in Yoga.t Even as the udder of
the cow gets wet with milk out of affection for her calf on
seeing it before her. -
“Yatte’hamn priyamanaya vaksyami hitakamyaya’—In this
expression the Lord says to Arjuna, “You love Me by heart
and I have the feeling for your welfare from the core of My
heart, therefore I shall again unfold to you ‘Jnana’ with ‘Vijnana’
which I have already unfolded to you in the seventh and in the
* na Sakyarm tanmaya bhuyastatha vaktumasesatah

(Mahabharata ASva. 16/12-13)
“The Lord said to Arjjuna—tThe repetition of whole gospel of the Gita in the
same way is out of My power. At that time I described the divinity (Godhood) by
getting established in Yoga.”
+ briiyuh snigdhasya Sisyasya guravo guhyamapyuta (Srimadbha. 1/1/8; 10/13/3)
“The preceptors disclose even the most profound secret to their loving disciple.’

ninth chapters.” It proves that the Lord in the seventh, ninth
and tenth—these three chapters has outpoured his heart for the
welfare of all beings.

word? The clarification is.

Neither gods (devata) nor the great sages (rsis) know the secret |
of My origin; for I am the prime cause, in all respects of gods, as
well as, the great sages. 2 | -
Comment:— |
""Na me viduh suraganah prabhavarh na maharsayah'—Though,
bodies, intellects, worlds and materials of the gods, are divine,
yet they do not know, the Lord's origin, of His incarnations -
and His divine glories etc. They are unable to know Him, in
His entire form; and His vision is difficult, for them. They are,
always eager to behold His form (Gita 11/52). :
Even seers or liberated souls, possessing uncommonly divine
powers, who have risen above the world, don't know, the secret |
of His origin, completely.
Here the Lord has mentioned gods and great seers, having
divine experience, because the gods, hold the highest rank next
to the Lord, and great seers possess, the highest knowledge. They
do not know Him, because whatever power, intellect, resources,
they have at their disposal, have been given by the Lord and
so, these are limited. So, how can the limitless Lord, be known
by limited power and resources etc.? As the birth and marriage
of a mother, remains beyond the access of a son, the gods and
"
1203,"1148 _ SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 10

the seers, who emanate from the Lord, don't know Him, who

is their cause. The effect can merge in the cause, but cannot

know it. Similarly, seers cannot know Him, their cause. They

can merge in Him. The whole universe including the gods and -
the seers, emanates from Him, and merges into Him.

Gods and sages cannot know the beginning, the end and the
interim (the present), of the Lord and how He is and in how |
many forms, He has manifested Himself. They cannot know His
dimensions and limits. The reason is, that He was the same,
when they were born and He will remain the same when they :
merge or die. So, how can they, whose bodies are born and die, -
know the beginningless, endless and limitless God, with their
limited intellect, ability and power etc. How can the limitless |
be confined to a limited intellect? -

In the fourteenth verse of this chapter, also the Lord declares,
that neither the gods nor the demons know His manifestation,
because the gods are ever engaged in enjoying heavenly pleasures,
while demons in knavery and beguilement. Thus, gods have no
time to know, Him and demons cannot know Him, by their -
knavery and beguilement.

Appendix— Whatever the Lord declared in the third verse of

the seventh chapter by the expression ‘manusyanam sahasresu’,
He declares the same here by the expression ‘na me viduh’.
Why do they not know God? The reason is that He is the prime
cause, in all respects of gods, as well as of the great sages. In the
twenty-sixth verse of the seventh chapter also the Lord declared,
“I know the created beings of the past, the present and the future
but no one knows Me.” Therefore Arjuna also in the fourteenth
and fifteenth verses says, “Neither the gods nor the demons know
You but You alone know Yourself by Yourself.”

In this verse the Lord has disclosed His sovereign secret. The
Lord is not known by knowledge, intellect, ability and power
etc., but He is known by the faith and belief of the inquisitive
"
1204,"Verse 3] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1149 -
devotee and by His own grace.
Link:—In the previous verse, it. has been mentioned that
neither gods nor great sages, know the secret of His origin, How -
then, can an ordinary striver, know Him and attain salvation?
The Lord answers. |
a aastanfe a aft atenea
says: A Ale Aaaa: Weds tt
yo mamajamanadim ca vetti lokamahesvaram -
asammiudhah sa martyesu sarvapapaih pramucyate
He who knows Me as unborn and without a beginning, as the -
Great Lord of the world, he, undeluded among men, is purged of -
all sins. 3 |
Comment:—
""Yo mamajamanadim ca vetti lokamaheSvaram'—Though, a
striver cannot know the Lord in His entirety, yet he can know
Him so much, that he can attain salvation. His knowledge about -
Him is that he can assume that the Lord is unborn, without
beginning and He is the Lord of all the lords, of the different
worlds. The Lord, is beyond time. The time which is referred
in the world by days and months etc., is ordinary time, while
the Lord is beyond time. This time rests in the Lord. The Lord |
is, eternal time. Such firm assumption removes, all doubts about
His glories. 7
""Asammiidhah sa martyesu sarvapapaih pramucyate'—The
Lord, is birthless, beginningless and is the Lord of all the lords.
It means, that He is imperishable and the supreme sovereign, of
the world. So, He pervades everywhere, everytime, all things and
is the Lord of everyone. It means, that He is here, now, in him
and his Lord also, while the world, is perishing every moment.
Thus knowing the reality about the Lord, and the world, one
"
1205,"1150 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter10
: renounces his affinity with the world (including the body) and
becomes free from the feeling of, ‘I'ness and 'Mineness'. Thus,
knowing the truth, he is no more deluded and by becoming free,
from the feeling of ‘ness and 'Mineness', he has affinity with __
the Lord, and becomes free from all sins, of the present and
the past. Mere learning of affinity with God, will not serve the
purpose. It is to be given a practical shape.
What is delusion? Delusion means, lack of knowledge,
about reality. What is reality? The reality is, that a man cannot
be identified with, the world and the body, while he cannot
be separated, from the Lord. The man, who is free from this -
delusion can know Him, endowed with attributes and without
attribute, endowed with form and formless in reality, and has
not the least doubt, about His different forms, sports, secrets
and glories etc.
| Appendix—lIn the twenty-fourth verse of the ninth chapter
the Lord by the negative inference said, “He who does not know
Me, has a fall.” Here by the positive inference He says, “He
who knows Me, is. purged of all sins.” -
Here the term ‘vetti? means—‘to accept firmly and
undoubtedly’ because God cannot be known by senses, mind
and intellect (Gita 10/2). Therefore God is not to be known but
He is to be believed and realized. When even prakrti cannot be
known, then how can God, Who is beyond Prakrti, be known?
Realization means—to merge the self into God and to be one with
Him by losing his independent identity. By becoming ‘abhinna’
God can be known, because in fact he (the self) 1s not apart
from Him, he is ‘abhinna’ with Him. Similarly the world can
be known by becoming detached from the world because in fact
he is detached from it. )
The great sages don’t know the secret of His origin but
they do know that the Lord is unborn and without a beginning.
_ The self, being a fragment of God, is also unborn and without
"
1206,"Verse 4-5] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1151 -
Z
$$
a beginning. Therefore when he knows the Lord as unborn :
and without a beginning, he will know the self also the same
(unborn and without a beginning) because the self by becoming
identified (abhinna) with God knows God. By knowing the self |
as unborn and without a beginning, he becomes undeluded, then -
how will sins stay in him? The reason is that sins have accrued
afterwards, the self is unborn and without beginning from time
immemorial. ‘Sarvapapaih pramucyate’ means—to be free from
attachment to the modes. So long as a man is attached to the
modes, he can’t be purged of sins because attachment to the |
modes is the root of sins. | | oe
_ In the verses fourth to sixth ahead there is discussion on
non-delusion in which the Lord has declared Himself to be the .
origin of all. The Lord Himself is without beginning and is the
origin of diverse feelings and great sages. a

unreal, the proper and the improper, the imperishable and the
perishable etc. This discrimination, has been bestowed upon
every human being, by God. a

‘Asammohah'—It is non-delusion. To have a feeling of 'T'ness

and its absence, is non-delusion. a .

""Ksama'—Whatever harm, a man may cause, if we bear it in

that he should not be punished by God, here or hereafter. This
sentiment is called 'Ksama’. -

‘Satyam'—Truth, is the accurate presentation for the welfare

_ of all of what one has heard, seen and known, without selfishness
and pride. :

‘Damah samah'—By having, the aim of God-realization, control -
over senses is called 'Damah' and control over the mind, so that
it may not think of mundane pleasures is called ‘Samah’.

. ‘Sukharn duhkham'—Feelings of pleasure in favourable |
circumstances, is 'Sukham’, and feelings of pain, in unfavourable
circumstances, is 'Duhkham’. | ,

'Bhavo'bhavah'—'Bhava', means birth or evolution of a thing,
being and incident etc., while 'Abhava’, means their death or
dissolution. |

'‘Bhayam cabhayameva ca'—A feeling of possibility of
some undesired result as a fruit of actions, against the saints,
scriptures or the social customs is 'Bhaya' (Fear), and lack of
fear is 'Abhaya' (Fearlessness).

'.  *Ahirnsa'—To hurt others, with body, mind and speech etc.,

of violence is ‘Ahimsa’ (Non-violence).
'‘Samata'—Evenness of mind or temper, in favourable and
unfavourable circumstances, is 'samata’ (equanimity).
'Tustih’—Contentment, 1n all circumstances, is ""Tustih’.
'Tapah'—To bear all circumstances happily while performing :
one's duty is ‘Tapah’, (austerity). To observe a fast on ‘ekadasi""
etc., is also, austerity. | |
'Danam'—It is a gift of objects or money, earned by honest
means, which is made to a deserving person happily, without
having any desire, for the fruit of action (Gita 17/20). :
""YaSo'yasah'—Fame, that a man receives as an outcome of -
his good qualities, feelings and actions, is ""YaSa' while ‘AyaSsah'
is ill-fame or disrepute, that a man acquires as outcome of his
bad conduct, feelings and deeds. | -
""Bhavanti bhava bhiitanarh matta eva prthagvidhah'— Diverse
feelings, of creatures emanate, from the Lord 1e., He is the base
and the root, of all of them.
Here ""Mattah’, stands for Lord's power and influence, while
‘Prthagvidhah’ stands, for His divine glories.
One who knows, that all of the good or bad actions and
feelings, in the world are nothing but the sport of the Lord gets
firmly established in Him, (Gita 10/7).
Out of the twenty diverse feelings mentioned here, twelve
have been called as single and they are all born in the mind.
Besides these fearlessness, which makes a pair with fear, is also
born in the mind. The remaining seven feelings, are contradictory.
Out of these evolution and dissolution, fame and disrepute—these
four are fruits of previous actions, while pleasure, pain and
fear—these three, are an outcome of folly. A man, is free in
wiping out this folly. ,
The Lord, is the base and root of all these twenty feelings.
In the twelfth verse of the seventh chapter also, He declares
"
1209,"| 1154 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter10  -
that whatever entities there are born of sattva (goodness), of
rajas (passion) and tamas (ignorance), know them all, as evolved
: from Him, alone. |
Therefore, the purpose of the Lord is to draw attention towards
Him, Who is the source of all divine glories and feelings. :
Whatever a striver, beholds in the world, is the Lord's
manifestation, and His sport. His sport, includes His pranks of :
boyhood at Ayodhya where He incarnates as Rama, there He .
: is loved by His father, mother and other people. He is received -
| and shown hospitality, by His father-in-law and mother-in-law,
and other people of Janakapuri. Then, His sport continues in
the woods, where He comes across, both devotees and demons. _
Afterwards, in Lanka his sport, includes battle and bloodshed. Thus,
all these sport have been included in the Ramayana. Similarly,
all the feelings, actions, whether similar or dissimilar, are the
| sports of the Lord. So a striver should always behold him, only
in various persons, things, incidents and feelings etc., because, -
He is at the root of all of them. |
_ Appendix—From the point of view of knowledge, all feelings
emanate from prakrti, but from the view-point of devotion, all
feelings emanate from God. If these feelings are regarded of
the self, the self being the ‘para prakrti’ (higher nature) of God,
is inseparable (one) with God, therefore these feelings are also
of God only. In God these feelings ever persist but in the self
they appear and disappear because of its attachment to the apara
(lower nature). As these feelings emanate from God, so they are
all the manifestations of God.
‘Prthagvidhah’——This expression means that as a hand is one
but in it there are different fingers, similarly God is one but the
feelings, which emanate from Him, are different. Though the

and all the creatures forming the world, have come forth from -
them. 6 :
Comment:— OS

[In the previous verses, the Lord mentioned His twenty —
glories, in the form of feelings. Now in this verse, He mentions
His twenty-five divine glories, in the form of persons, who are
administrators, of the entire creation.]

""Maharsayah sapta'——The seven great seers, are those who
possess seven qualities—they are long lived, they have revealed a
sacred formulas, they are glorious, they possess divine vision, |
they are learned, they have realized righteousness, and they are |
inventors of 'Gotras' (sub-castes). These seven seers are—Marici, |
Angira, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu and Vasistha. They know
Vedas, and are reputed as annotators of the Vedas. They are
administrators, of creation and are appointed to help Brahma,
the creator, in his work.

'Pirve catvarah'—Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanatana and
Sanatkumara, were the first to be born, of the mind of Brahma,
after he did penance. They are manifestations of the Lord.
They always remain, children of five years. They wander in the
three worlds, to promulgate devotion, knowledge (wisdom) and |
dispassion. They always utter the words ‘Hari Saranam’ (Refuge
"
1211,"1156 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter10  ~
| in the Lord). They love divine discourses, and so one of them
holds divine discourses and the other three, listen to him.

""Manavastatha'—In a day of Brahma, which consists of
43,20,000,000 years of mortals, there are fourteen Manus. They
are Svayambhuva, Svarocisa, Uttama, Tamasa, Raivata, Caksusa, :
Vaivasvata, Savami, Daksasavarni, Brahmasavarni, Dharmasavarni,
Rudrasavarni, Devasavarni and Indrasavarni.* They are creators
and activators of the world, by carrying out Brahma's orders.

'‘Manasa jatah'—They are born of the mind of Brahma, in
order to create the universe. So they can be called, Brahma's .
sons. They can also be called the Lord's sons, because the Lord -
manifested Himself as Brahma, in order to create the world. The |
whole creation, is the product of the Lord's mind.

_ “Madbhava'—They are all devoted to the Lord. _
_ ""Yesarn loka imah prajah'—There are two types of creatures,
in the world—those born of the contact of the male and female,
and those born of word (sacred word or text) or preaching. The
former, are called 'Binduja’ while the latter are called ‘Nadaja’.

All the great saints and souls of the past, the present and -
the future, following the path of renunciation, as well as Sanaka
etc., who were not married, belong to the latter type, while the
off-springs born of seven great sages and fourteen Manus, who
were married, belong to the former category.

Appendix—The seven great sages, four Sanakas etc., and
fourteen Manus— they are all born of the Lord’s mind and
therefore are inseparable (one) with God. —

‘Yoga’, stands for His singular infinite power. All His divine

_ When a man enjoys worldly pleasures, his power is mitigated,
and the things are destroyed. Thus, there is a double loss. But, if
he uses the things without deriving pleasure out of them, his power
is not mitigated. Actually, there is no real joy, in enjoying sense-
objects. Real joy, comes out of restraint. This self-control, can be
classified into two kinds (i) Control over others (ii) Self-control.
The first means, that the sorrows of others may be annihilated _—Ss_—y
and they may become happy—with this sentiment to direct them,
towards a virtuous path by deviating them from a wrong path.
The second one, means, to renounce selfishness and pride, totally
and not to enjoy pleasures, in the least. This twofold self-control,
"
1213,"1158 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 10 -
is known as 'Yoga’ or ‘power’. This Yoga or power, is innate
in the Lord, while in other creatures, it is a result of practice.

When a man controls others, with egoistic and selfish feelings,

he experiences a sort of joy. In this joy, his power is mitigated
and he, whom he coftrols, becomes a slave. Therefore, instead :

of this control, there should be such control, in which there is no

selfish or egoistic feeling, it involves welfare of others. and their

freedom from suffering since eternity and attainment of supreme

bliss—this is excellent and is supreme control. At the top of it,

stands the Lord's control, and that is called 'Yoga’.

The term 'Yoga’, also stands for equanimity, union with -
God and power. The Lord is all-powerful. All power, comes
from Him only. This power is partly revealed in man, if he ,
becomes desireless. On having desires, the power decreases, and
on effacement of desires, power is accumulated. By working -
continuously, this power is exhausted and by repose, it is gained,
as a man gets tired, by speaking continuously, he regains power |
by silence. Power is lost in creation, and gained, in dissolution.

It means, that power is mitigated by affinity with Nature, and ;
regained by renunciation. —

""Yo vetti tattvatah'—A discerning man, knows that whatever
singularity is seen in the universe, is the power and glory of :
the Lord. As a goldsmith, while making ornaments of different
kinds, always keeps in mind, that in them there is nothing
besides gold, a striver should behold every person, object or
action, as a manifestation of the Lord, because all persons and
objects etc., are kaleidoscopic and perishable; so they have no |
singularity of their own. Whatever, singularity is seen in them,
is the reflection of the Lord, Who is eternal and imperishable.
Therefore, an onlooker should behold the Lord everywhere. This
is real knowledge.* . :

* In this context of devotion 'Tattvatah vetti' (Knows in truth) should mean
‘Assumption (Supposition) in truth.’ When a man assumes that he belongs to a
"
1214,"Verse 7] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1159 _
'‘So'vikampena yogena yujyate'—He is endowed with,
unfaltering devotion to the Lord i.e., he'is attracted only towards,
the Lord. : | |
' ""Natra sarhSayah'—There is no doubt. It means, that after
knowing the Lord in reality, a striver instead of paying attention -
to the divine glory and power, etc., beholds these only as a |
manifestation of the Lord i.e., he beholds only God. No worldly
grandeur, can influence him. Thus, it fosters his devotion, to Him.
 Appendix—Whatever singularity (speciality) is observed in |
the world, that is all the Lord’s yoga viz., Lord’s uncommon
influence and power. The speciality which evolves from that .
uncommon influence, is ‘vibhuti’ (manifestation)—thus he who 7
knows, in reality, this divine glory and power of God, is endowed |
with unfaltering devotion, of this there is no doubt. ‘There is
no other existence at all besides God’—this firm and doubtless -
acceptance is ‘to know God in reality’. The Lord has called such
aman, who knows in reality the divine glory and power of God,
the man of wisdom viz., ‘Jiianavan’ (Gita 7/19).
The Lord by the expression ‘Avikampayoga’ means to say -
that this ‘Bhaktiyoga’ neither shakes itself, nor anyone can shake
it, because in it there is nothing else besides God.
All things can be bought by paying money—by thinking
so, a common man values money and so he is attracted towards
money. Similarly when aman holds that whatever majesty or value
appears, that is all only God’s, he is naturally attracted toward
God and is endowed with unfaltering devotion for God. |
The expression ‘natra sarnSayah’ means that when there is
no other entity at all besides God, then how can there be any
doubt in it? There is no room for doubt at all because a doubt
particular caste his assumption continues so long as he does not renounce it.
That assumption is not true because that depends on affinity with the body and
so can perish. But the assumption that the Lord is the root and origin of the
entire universe is real: So it can never perish but changes into knowledge.
"
1215,"1160 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 10 _
can arise only when there are two entities. When there is no one
else besides God, then where will a striver have his inclination,
why will he have it, in whom will he have it and how will
he have it? Therefore the striver is endowed with unfaltering
devotion in God—there is no doubt about it. -

who knows in reality His divine glory and power, is endowed

their manifestations appear is His divine yoga. It is expressed
_ through the word Mattah. Whatever, has been said in the seventh,
eighth and ninth chapters, has been condensed in the first line
of this verse.]
‘Aham sarvasya prabhavah'—The Lord is the material and
efficient cause of all creatures, born through mind, word, semen,
earth, womb, egg, sweat viz., He is the origin of the whole
creation, sentient or insentient, moving or unmoving.* He is
* As the Lord has declared in the sixth verse of the seventh chapter that
He is the source of the entire creation and in the fourth verse of the fourteenth

the material cause, as weil as the efficient cause, of the entire
creation. It means, that He has manifested Himself, in the form
of the entire creation. _ Oo :
'Mattah sarvarh pravartate'—Everything, in the world moves,
because of the Lord. As-electricity manifests itself, in various -
forms in instruments suited to those forms, the Lord, is the root
of all the worldly actions. | |
_ _ 'Aharh sarvasya......pravartate'—The Lord says that a striver,
instead. of paying attention to various feelings, actions, things
and persons etc., should behold the Lord, Who is the origin of
all of them: | :
The Lord, uses the term 'Mattah’ (from Me), again and
again, as in the seventh and the twelfth verse of the seventh ,
chapter and fifth and the eighth verse of the tenth chapter, to
emphasize the fact that all feelings, actions and creatures etc., -
emanate from Him, remain established in Him, and merge into
Him. So if a striver, either knows or assumes this fact, that in |
the entire universe, there is nothing else, besides the Lord, he
will have unwavering unity (Yoga), with Him. |
Here, by giving the word ‘Sarva’ (All), two times, the Lord
means to say that, only He is the creator and conductor, of the
entire suniverse. _
""Iti matva bhavasamanvitah'—When strivers assume, that the
Lord is the creator and conductor of the entire creation, and He is
the supreme Lord and none is equal to Him, none will be equal
to Him, and none can be equal to Him, they place their faith
and devotion, in Him and their attention, never deviates from
Him. In those devotees, who entirely depend on Him, divine
traits such as equanimity, fearlessness, truthfulness etc., grows
naturally. The reason is, that where there is Divinity, there are
divine traits. | | |

of the whole creation.
"
1217,"1162 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 10 -
‘Budha'—They are wise because they behold the Lord, as the
origin of entire creation. The same fact, has been’ pointed out,
by the Lord in the eighteenth and the nineteenth verses of the
fifteenth chapter, when He declares, ""One who knows Me beyond
perishable Matter and superior to the imperishable soul, knows Me, :
in reality and worships Me, with all his heart"" (Gita 15/18-19).
‘Mar bhajante'—Uttering and loud chanting, of the name
of the Lord, thinking of the Lord, meditation, listening to divine
discourses, study of scriptures, such as the Gita, the Ramayana ,
etc., all this is, worship. But the real worship is that in which a
devotee, likes and loves nothing, besides the Lord. Forgetfulness -
of the Lord, is repugnant to their nature. Such absorption in
God, is real worship.
Every striver, should know that the Lord is the origin and
the source of power, of all things, objects, creatures and persons.
So the only aim of the life, should be God-realization. The
Lord mentions His divine glories and power, in order to attract ;
the attention of the strivers, towards Him. This fact, has been
mentioned in the Gita, several times—'He from whom is the
emanation of all beings, by Whom all this is pervaded, should ,
be worshipped through the performance of one’s duty’ (18/46).
""The Lord Who dwells in the hearts of all beings and Who is
the source of inspiration for them, they should seek refuge in
Him alone, with all their heart"" (18/61-62) etc.
The Disciplines of Action, Knowledge and Devotion are
various disciplines for different strivers,. according to their
tastes and interests, but the above-mentioned knowledge, is
very. necessary, for all the strivers.
Appendix——People attach importance to money because things
can be acquired (gained) by paying money. Things are gained
by paying money but they don’t evolve, but from God all things
"
1218,"Verse 9] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1163 -
evolve and are also gained. Therefore those who realize God’s glory
instead of getting entangled in the greed for petty money, worship
God—‘sa sarvavidbhajati mam sarvabhavena bharata’ (Gita 15/19).
- The Lord declares that all objects and persons. emanate
from. Him .(aham sarvasya: prabhavah) and He is the root of -
all actions (mattah sarvath pravartate). But a man (the self) by
having affinity with objects and actions, by assuming them as his .
and by becoming their enjoyer and doer, gets bound. When he :
becomes the enjoyer of objects, the objects lead him to bondage,
and when he becomes the doer of actions, the actions lead him
to bondage. If he neither becomes an enjoyer nor a doer, there
is no bondage for him. | -
Whatever glory is seen in the world is emanating from God.
The fact has been mentioned in Gita by the Lord by the term -
‘mattah’ several times as— : : _
‘mattah paratararn nanyatkificidasti’ (7/7) _
“of this world there is no other cause or effect besides Me.”
‘matta eveti tanviddhi? (7/12)
‘These (Sattvika, Rajasa and Tamasa) modes are evolved
from Me—know them so.’ -

[Those who have realized, that the Lord is the origin and
source of inspiration of all things and.creatures, for them nothing
remains to be done, to be known and to be acquired. They. have )
ever, to be engrossed in Him. The same fact, has been explained -
in this verse.] :

""Maccitta'—Their minds are fixed on the Lord. There are -
two things—one is the fixation of the mind on the Lord, and the 7
second is fixation of the self on the Lord. When a devotee, by
admitting the fact that he is the Lord's, is absorbed in Him, his
mind, intellect etc., are automatically absorbed in Him, because,
these organs depend on the doer. So, if a devotee worships the
Lord and wants to fix his mind on Him, by thinking, that he -
is a worldly householder, it is very difficult for him to fix
his mind. It means, that if he himself remains devoted to the
world, and attempts to absorb his mind in God, it is practically
impossible.

Secondly, a person can fix his mind on what he likes the
most, and he likes the most a thing or person with whom he has
affinity. So, a devotee should admit the fact, that he is only the
Lord's and the Lord is only, his. The body and the world, are not
his. So he surrenders himself to Him and His will, becomes his
will. Such devotees, are said to have fixed their minds on God. |

In the Gita 'Mana' and ‘Citta’, have been used in different

: ‘Madgataprana'—They surrender their life and actions, spiritual § ~~
as well as mundane to the Lord. Just like cowherdesses, they
surrender their lives to Him. They are not attached to their vital __
force. They have, neither.a desire to live, nor are afraid of death, ,
because they know that they are different, from life and have no
affinity with it, while their affinity with the Lord is axiomatic. _

So, a striver's only aim, should be to realize God without caring .
for favourable and unfavourable circumstances, such as health :
and sickness, respect, insult and pleasure and pain etc. _
""Bodhayantah parasparam'—When two devotees meet, they /
talk about the sport, secrets, qualities and glories of the Lord.
Thus, they share His devotion, with. each other and are more
absorbed in Him.* They are enlightened, with the help of
each other, in the same way, as darkness is dispelled from
under two lighted earthen lamp, if they are placed, facing each ;
other. Such devotion and enlightenment is not possible while
concentrating alone. | |
""KathayantaSca mam'—-When they meet, any devotee who
is interested in listening to, a divine discourse, they hold the
discourse. As Sanaka etc., all the four hold divine discourses,
and also listen to them. One of them, becomes a speaker and the __
other three become, the listeners. But the speaker is not proud
of his talent, and the listener is not ashamed of his becoming,
a listener. :

and stories (Srimadbha. 10/13/2). . :

""Ramanti ca'—They take delight in him. In that state, they |

of love, between the Lord and his devotee, continues for infinite a
ages and this love, enhances every moment.
Thus a striver should direct all his feelings and actions,
towards the Lord. | oe | .
-  Appendix—Here the Lord describes the unfaltering Yoga of -
devotion described in the seventh verse. The mind of devotees ;
ever remains absorbed in God, it does not wander anywhere. From
their view-point, when there is no other entity besides God, then -
where will their mind wander, how will it wander and why will
it wander? Those devotees live alive only for God and all their
actions are also surrendered to God. If anyone wants to listen
to the Lord’s qualities, glories, life history and sports etc., they
narrate the extraordinary facts of the Lord’s life to him, being -
absorbed in them (glories etc.,) and if anyone is interested in
narrating them, the devotees listen to him by getting engrossed
in them in a loving manner. In it neither the narrator nor the
listener is contented. There is no contentment—this is disunion;
and there is even new relish—this is union. Because of this
disunion and union, the love is enhanced every moment. In the
‘Naradabhaktisutra’ it is mentioned—
‘Kanthavarodha romajficasrubhih paraspararn lapamanah

Comment:— |

[A devotee of the Lord, has no desire to gain wisdom or -
equanimity or anything else, besides the Lord.* They ever remain _
absorbed in Him. So, their whole responsibility devolves on the
Lord, they become mere instruments in His hands. So the Lord
confers, the Yoga of wisdom, on them.]

and glories of the Lord and exchange these with one another,
and who ever remain contented, and delighted, in Him.

""Bhajatam pritipirvakam'—Not to speak of, mundane pleasures
and prosperity and occult powers, those devotees do not have a
desire even for spiritual knowledge and dispassion. They always

'‘Mamupayanti te'—Those devotees, who surrender themselves

Appendix—So long as attachment and aversion persist, only |
the world appears, the Lord is not visible. The Lord transcends -
the pairs of opposites. As long as there are pairs of opposites
in the form of attachment and aversion, two entities instead of ""
one appear. But when attachment and aversion are wiped out, — _
then nothing is seen besides God. It means when attachment
and aversion are wiped out and equanimity is attained, then
‘all is God’—this is realized.’ Therefore the Lord confers on
His devotees equanimity. This equanimity is ‘buddhiyoga’ viz.,
Karmayoga—‘samatvam yoga ucyate’ (Gita 2/48). In the Gita -
Karmayoga has been called ‘buddhiyoga’ as “dtrena hyavararh
karma buddhiyogaddhanaiijaya’ (2/49), “‘buddhiyogamupasritya
maccittah satatarh bhava’ (18/57). Having attained buddhiyoga’
(equanimity), a devotee by sharing the sorrows of others, tries
to comfort (console) them.
One sort of reflection (thinking) is done intentionally and the
other occurs naturally. Whatever reflection or adoration is done
that is unnatural and which automatically occurs 1s natural. The
reflection which is done, does not ever persist but the reflection
which occurs, like breathing, ever persists continuously without
any break—‘satatayukténam’. If a striver loves his body and
is attached to it, he has to think of (reflect upon) God and the
thoughts pertaining to body crop up automatically. But when
there is true love for (one’s ownness with) God, one has not

worship the Lord, with devotion without a desire for fruit. The
Lord, is very much pleased with their devotion and His heart
melts, with compassion. So, He wants to confer something on
them. But they have no desire. So, by His grace He destroys their :
ignorance-born darkness, and enables them to attain perfection.
He removes, all their deficiencies.
_ ‘Atmabhavasthah'—Generally, people identify themselves,
with their bodies, and consider the change of their bodies, as
their own change. Actually, the self is different from the body.
The Lord dwells, in that self.
""Bhasvata jiianadipena nasayami'—The Lord, destroys the
ignorance-born darkness, by a luminous lamp of wisdom. It means,
that He enables a devotee to realize the self, or to behold the
Divine Presence, within himself. The devotee has not to practise,
any spiritual discipline like hearing, thinking and assimilation
etc. He has not to make any efforts, for Self-realization.
"
1225,"1170 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 10 :
When a devotee remains absorbed, only in the Lord, the
Lord confers on him equanimity, as well as supremely holy
Self-realization. It means, that the devotee has not. to make ;
efforts, either for equanimity or Self-realization,* because where,
there is a mother in the form of devotion, there are as children
dispassion and knowledge (Self-realization). It means, that the
perfection attained by the aspirant, may have some deficiency.
But the perfection conferred by the Lord, has not even a trace
of imperfection. — Be : | |
As the Lord, provides gain and security to those devotees -
who worship Him, alone (Gita 9/22), He confers equanimity
and Self-realization to those devotees, who entirely depend on -
Him, though they have no desire. And even, by conferring _
equanimity and Self-realization, He remains a debtor to them.
As the Lord, Himself declares: in the Bhagavata about the
cowherdesses—""I can't pay the debt of the chaste cowherdesses,
even by having the long age of the gods, because they broke |
the chain of domestic affinity, which even great seers and -
_ sages don't break, easily"" (10/32/22). |
The devotees, are so much absorbed in devotion for the Lord,
that they are surprised to perceive equanimity and Self-realization
in them. Moreover, they pray to God, that they should not feel any
singularity in them, by having His gifts given to them by His grace,
but they ever want to remain absorbed in devotion to Him. Even if,
they are vouchsafed the power to emancipate the world, they don't
feel elevated in anyway, and keep always absorbed, in God.
Appendix—Though Karmayoga and Jnanayoga—both these
disciplines are the means while Bhaktiyoga (the Discipline of
Devotion) is the end, yet the Lord confers on His devotees
* My devotees, besides service to Me, don't ever aspire for five kinds
of salvation. |

Karmayoga (equanimity)—‘dadami buddhiyogarh tam’ and also |
confers Jnanayoga—‘jnanadipena bhasvata’. Apara (the lower)
and para (the highér)—both these prakrtis (natures) are God’s.
Therefore the Lord by showering His. grace, confers on His
devotee Karmayoga in which there is predominance of apara -
and also Jhanayoga in which there is predominance of para.
Therefore a devotee easily attains ‘niskamabhava’ (selflessness) __
which a Karmayogi wants to attain; and also Self-realization
which-a Jiianayogi wants to attain. Having attained Karmayoga,
good to the world is done by a. devotee and having attained
Jfanayoga, the devotee’s (self’s) identification with the body |
is annihilated. __ a -
A devotee remains contented and engrossed in thinking of
God and in loving Him. He neither feels that he lacks anything =~
nor he feels that he needs to gain. anything. As a child totally _
depends on its mother, it does not think of its needs. The mother
fully takes care of it, she bathes it, she changes its clothes when
they are dirty. Similarly when a devotee. surrenders himself totally
to God by holding, ‘As I am, I am God’s and only God is mine’,
he does not think of himself. Therefore the Lord, dwelling in his
self, destroys his darkness, born. of ignorance, by the luminous
lamp of wisdom. A child is specially stupid (deluded) while a
devotee is specially discriminative. a
The main duty of a devotee is to assume the Lord as his own.
When a devotee discharges his duty, the Lord also discharges His
duty, and without the demand, without the desire of the devotee,
of His own accord, confers on him the power of both—Karmayoga
and Jiianayoga so that he may not lack anything.
In Karmayoga there is Bliss in the form of peace, in
Jnanayoga there is constant Bliss (akhandarasa) and in Bhaktiyoga
there is infinite (endless) Bliss (anantarasa). In ‘Santarasa’ and
‘akhandarasa’—‘anantarasa’ is not included but in ‘anantarasa’
both—‘santarasa’ and ‘akhandarasa’ are included.
"
1227,"1172 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 10 _
Karmayoga and Jiianayoga are ‘laukika’ (worldly) disciplines
but Bhaktiyoga is ‘alaukika’ (unworldly) discipline. Having attained
the ‘alaukika’ by God’s grace the ‘laukika’ is naturally attained -
but having attained the ‘laukika’ the ‘alaukika’ is not attained.
The reason is that the ‘laukika’ is included in the ‘alaukika’ but OO
in ‘laukika’ ‘alaukika’ is not included. —
A jnani can be devoid of devotion, but a devotee can’t be
devoid of knowledge (Self-realization).* The Gopis did not study |
the Vedas, nor did they have association with the enlightened _
exalted souls nor did they observe fast (vows) and austerities
etc.,f yet they possessed extraordinary knowledge+. It means :
that a devotee realizes the self. He has already realized ‘All is -
God’—‘Vasudevah sarvam’. |
‘Atmabhavasthah’—God abides in the self because the self is
a fragment of God. In fact God has revealed Himself in the form -
of the soul (self) because being the para prakrti of God, the self
is inseparable with God. In the Upanisad it is mentioned that the
Lord having created the bodies, entered these bodies—‘tatsrstva
tadevanupravisat’ (Taittiriya. 2/6).

Comment:— |
'‘Sarvametadrtam manye yanmam vadasi keSava'—'K’ stands,
for Brahma, the creator, 'A' stands for, Lord Visnu, the preserver, -
‘Isa’ stands for, Lord Sankara, the destroyer and 'Va' stands for
""Vapu' the body. So 'KeSava’ stands for the trinity of Brahma,
Visnu and Sankara. It means, that He is the creator, preserver
and destroyer, of the entire creation.
By using the term 'Yat' (which), Arjuna means that whatever
the Lord has said to him, from the seventh to the ninth chapters,
he holds as true. By ‘Etat’ (this), he means to say, that he also
believes-as true, whatever He has said, in the tenth chapter about
His divine glories and power. It means, that He is the creator, :
conductor and the supreme Lord, of the entire creation, without
any doubt. /
In the Discipline of Devotion, importance is attached to faith.
Lord Krsna, in the first verse of this chapter ordered Arjuna to
listen to His supreme word. So Arjuna, expresses his faith in
"
1231,"1176 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 10 :
His words by using the term, 'Rtam' (True). . .
""Na hi te bhagavanvyaktim vidurdeva na danavah'—O Lord,
You declared (in Gita 4/5), “Arjuna, you and I, have passed through
many births. I know them all, while you don't."" Similarly, You
declared (in Gita 10/2), ""Neither the gods nor the great sages, -
know the secret, of My birth."" Thus, Arjuna believes as true, |
whatever the Lord declared about His manifestation. Though
the gods, possess divine power, yet that power is perishable. So
_ the ‘gods cannot know, His manifestation. As far as, demons are |
concerned, they possess uncommon magical and fraudulent power, |
by which they cannot know the Lord's manifestation, because .
He, being eternal and limitless, cannot be known by perishable :
- and limited power, of demons. It means, that the Lord cannot be
known, by the power of men, gods and demons, because their
power belongs to matter, while He is beyond Matter. Renunciation, .
dispassion, austerity and study of the scriptures etc., can purify
the mind, but cannot enable a man, to know the Lord. The Lord,
can be known, by His grace to the devotee who having exclusive
devotion, depends on Him, only.
Appendix—No one can know God through his own endeavours, _
but He can be known only by His own grace— |
‘soi janai jehi dehu janai,

'Bhittabhavana bhiteSa devadeva jagatpate purusottama'—
Being the origin, of all beings even through His thought, He is
‘Bhutabhavana’, being the Lord of beings He is Bhittesa; being
the Lord of the gods, He is ‘Devadeva'; being the preserver of |
the universe He is ‘Jagatpate', and being supreme, of all the
persons He is known as ‘Purusottama’, in the world, and in the |
Vedas (Gita 15/18). | -
In this verse, five vocatives have been used for the Lord. In
no other verse, in the Gita, so many vocatives have been used, -
at a time, because, he is enraptured by listening to His divine _
glories and His grace for the devotees.*
'‘Svayamevatmanatmanam vettha tvam'—He knows Himself,
by Himself, without any external help of instruments etc. This
knowledge, is beyond instruments. It is transcendental, and comes
not through, instruments.
A conclusion, from the verse can be drawn, that as the Lord
knows Himself by Himself, the soul, a fragment of the Lord
should also know itself, by itself, because 1t cannot be known,
by senses, mind and intellect etc. : |
Appendix——“You alone know Yourself by Yourself’—it means
that You are the knower, You are the entity to be known and
You are also the act of knowing viz., You are all. When there
is no one else besides You, then who should know and to whom |
should he know? | = :
If an effort is made to. know the Supreme Reality (Divinity),
* Here 'Bhitabhavana’, ‘BhuteSsa’, 'Devadeva’, ‘Jagatpate’ and 'Purusottama’
can denote the sun, Lord Siva, Lord Gane§a, Durga and Lord Visnu, the five great
deities of the rank of the Lord. By using those five terms Arjuna means to say that
He has manifested Himself as these five deities. -
"
1233,"1178 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 10 -
we are distanced from that reality because when a striver holds
that there is some entity to be known, then he wants to know
it. That Divinity is the knower of all, He is not to be known.
No one can be the knower of the Lord Who is the knower of
all.* As with the eye everything can be seen but the eye can’t -
be seen with the eye, because the power of seeing of the eye
is not the sense-object viz., powers of senses themselves are
beyond the reach of senses.t Therefore God Himself is known
by Himself. |

that his devotion for Him, may be aroused. Arjuna wants to
attain salvation, through devotion. So, he wants to know, in
full His divine glories, which cannot be described by anyone
else, beside Him. : | a
'Vaktumarhasyasesena'—Arjuna, tells Lord Krsna, that He :
spoke of His glories (in seventh, ninth chapters and also at the
beginning of the tenth chapter). He also explained, that he who
knows His glories is endowed, with unfaltering devotion. So | :
Arjuna prays to Him, to describe His glories in full, so that he
may know them and be endowed with unfaltering devotion, as
this is an easy way for obtaining it. .
""Divya hyatmavibhitayah'—Arjuna, calls the glories of
the Lord, as divine, because, whatever singularity is seen in -
the universe, is only the Lord's. So a striver should think that _
whatever singularity or attraction is seen, in the universe, is not
of the universe, but only of the Lord. Therefore, to see anything
charming in the world, is sense-enjoyment while to see the glory
of the Lord is 'Vibhiuti', and is also, 'Yoga’.
Appendix—Arjuna says to Lord Krsna, “You alone, can .
describe in full your divine glories because You alone know
Yourself by Yourself” (10/15). “Anyone else may know You—it
is not possible” (10/2, 14). “Therefore You alone can narrate '
your total divine glories that I may be endowed with unfaltering
devotion.”

- ‘Katharh vidyamaham yogimstvam sada paricintayan'— The
Lord, in the seventh verse of this chapter, said that he who knows
Him in reality, gets established in Him, through unwavering —
devotion. So Arjuna asks Him, how he may know Him, by
constant meditation..  __ es |
'Kesu kesu ca bhavesu cintyo'si bhagavanmaya'—The Lord, in
the fourteen verse of the eighth chapter, declared, ""I am easily ;
attainable to the ever steadfast Yogi, who constantly thinks of Me,
with undivided mind."" Again, He declared, in the twenty-second |
verse of the ninth chapter, “To those devotees who constantly think -
of Me, and worship Me alone, who are ever-devout, I provide 7
gain and security."" So Arjuna asks Him, in what various aspects -
He is to be thought of, by him. [Here meditation (thought), is _
the means, while Knowledge about Him, is the end.] | |
Arjuna asks Lord Krsna, ""In what things, persons, places
etc., are You to be thought of, by me?"" Lord Krsna, will further
reply, ""There is no creature animate or inanimate which can exist,
without Me. I stand holding the entire universe, with a single -
fragment of Myself.” It means, that He pervades everywhere, all
things, creatures and incidents etc. So, whatever glory, brilliance,
beauty, prosperity or power etc., he thinks of, he should think it
: only of the Lord and thus, instead of thinking of the universe,
he will think only, of Him.
Appendix—Arjuna’s question means, “O Lord! In which
forms have You revealed Yourself so that I may think of You
in those forms?’ Arjuna’s this question aims at easy realization |
of God. Arjuna is a representative of all strivers, therefore his
question is useful for all strivers. Arjuna knew Lord Krsna but
he did not know Him in His entire form. He had inquisitiveness
(curiosity) to know the Lord’s entire form. So he asks Lord
Krsna. “How should I know You in Your entire form and in
what different forms should I think of You?” It proves that the
"
1236,"Verse 18] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 1181 -
Lord’s divine glories are not of secondary importance but they
_ are very important as they are the means for God-realization.
The Lord has revealed Himself in the form of His divine glories.
So long as a striver does not know God in reality, he has the
notion of primary or secondary importance. But when he knows :
_ God in reality, then he has no notion of primary or secondary
importance because when there is no other entity besides God,
then what is the question of primary or secondary importance?
_ Tt: means that there are the primary and the secondary, from the
view-point of a striver, not from the view-point of God and of .
an enlightened soul. , -

Comment:— |
-'Vistarenatmano yoga vibhiitim ca janardana'—Lord Krsna,
explained the topic of knowledge (Wisdom) with realization, in
the seventh and the ninth chapters, in detail, but He was not
satisfied. So He Himself started the topic again, in the tenth
chapter, by asking Arjuna to listen to His supreme word. Arjuna’'s
attention was drawn particularly towards the Lord's grace, and
His glories. So he requests Him to tell him further in detail, of
His glories and His power of Yoga, so that he may be endowed,
with unfaltering devotion to Him : |
""Bhiiyah kathaya trptirhi Srnvato nasti me'mrtam'—Arjuna
wants to know what is decidedly good for him (Gita 2/7; 3/2; 5/1)
"
1237,"1182 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 10
and Lord Krsna has declared, that he who knows in reality, His
‘divine glory and power, is endowed with unfaltering devotion
(Gita 10/7). So Arjuna thinks, that it is an easy means, to be
endowed with unfaltering devotion, by knowing of His divine -
glories, so that, unfaltering devotion will lead him to salvation.
Then he requests Him to advise him of His divine. glories in
detail once again. | : |
As a’person, while taking a meal requests for a tasty dish,
again and again, while taking meals the taste suffers either owing :
to not getting the food in plenty or on stomach being full, but :
such is not the case in divine glories as they are infinite and -
there is no satiety while hearing them. Arjuna wants to listen
to the Lord's nectarean words again, because His glories are
numberless and Arjuna knows no satiety, in hearing them. -
Appendix—As a hungry man relishes food and a thirsty
man relishes water, similarly the Lord’s utterances seem very
extraordinary to inquisitive Arjuna. The more extraordinary the —
Lord’s utterances appear to Arjuna, the more devotional feelings
are welling up (aroused) in him for the Lord.* | :

 'Hanta te kathayisyami divya hyatmavibhitayah'—Arjuna,
requests Lord Krsna, to tell him more of divine glories and
power. So Lord Krsna starts talking of His divine glories here, -
(He will speak of His power in the forty-first verse). |
By the term ‘Divya’ (Divine), the Lord says, that whatever
singularity is seen in the universe, is of the Lord. Therefore,
a striver, should behold the Lord everywhere, in all the things ;
and person etc. | | - a
‘Pradhanyatah -kuruSrestha nastyanto vistarasya me'—
Arjuna requests Lord Krsna to tell him His divine glories in
detail. Lord Krsna tells him that He will explain His divine
glories in brief, because there is no end to the details. But, in
the eleventh chapter when Arjuna hesitatingly says to Lord
Krsna, ""If You consider me capable of beholding Your Cosmic ;
Form, O Lord of Yoga, show me, Your Eternal self."" Lord
Krsna asks him to behold His hundreds and thousands of divine
forms. How surprising!* It is surprising, because a person can
* By the ear we come to know of the things visible as well as invisible _
(heaven, hell etc.). In the process of theology ‘hearing’ occupies the first position.
In devotion also ‘hearing’ occupies the first position. We come to know of Pure-
Consciousness by hearing and then by assumption or knowledge we attain salvation
or God-realization.
When a man sleeps, his senses being contracted merge in the mind, the
mind merges in intellect, the intellect merges in ignorance. Thus in his sleep his
senses are not active. But if a man at that time is called by his name, he wakes up .
because of a lot of power in the words. Thus the words have an access not only
to the ear but to the self.
Eyes can see the form or colour. But their power is limited and is less than
that of ears.
The senses can perceive their own objects only. They can't perceive the
"
1239,"1184 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA _ [Chapter 10
hear more than, he can see. The power of vision, is limited and
less than that of hearing. Then why does the Lord say so? The
reason is, that by listening to the gospel of Gita, Arjuna comes
to know of the Lord's power, more and more. In this chapter, -
when the Lord declares that there is no end to the details of
His manifestations, Arjuna comes to know of his endlessness.
He thinks that his knowledge about the Lord, is very meagre.
So he becomes cautious and requests the Lord hesitatingly, to
show him His Cosmic Form. The Lord by His grace bestows
upon him, divine éyes and directs him to behold His, hundreds :
and thousands of, divine forms. — : -
Secondly, when a listener asks a speaker something, having -
pride of his own, he cannot get a satisfactory answer. But when
_he puts a question politely, modestly and innocently, he gets a ~
satisfactory answer. In this chapter, Arjuna wants to know of His
glories, in order to know, His limit. So the Lord declares that
there is no end or limit to, His glories. So He will be brief. But,
- in the eleventh chapter, he prays to Him politely and hesitatingly,
to show him His Universal Form, the Lord confers on him, ~
divine eyes and enables him to behold His Cosmic Form. So, a
striver, by renouncing his pride should totally depend on God,
in order to gain infinite bliss. |
Appendix—God is infinite; therefore His divine glories are
also infinite. Therefore the details of the Lord’s divine glories
can neither be narrated nor be heard. If they can be narrated
and heard, how will they remain endless? Therefore the Lord
declares that He will tell His divine glories in brief.
The Lord addresses Arjuna as ‘kurusrestha’—by this He means
Cosmic Soul (Pure-Consciousness). The Pure-Consciousness can be Known
by one’s own self. So Arjuna said, ""You alone know Yourself by Yourself
(Gita 10/15). In the second chapter the Lord declared, “When a man thoroughly
abandons all desires, he is satisfied in the self through the self"" (Gita 2/55). It
means that the self can't be perceived by the senses. So the self can't be perceived
by eyes; but the ear by perceiving it transmits it to the self. a

seers, (Gita 10/2) and at the end also He remains (Srimadbhagavata 10/3/25).
But in the middle at the time of creation persons, creatures and objects etc., of
masculine, feminine and common gender live in the universe. Thus the common
gender includes all the three genders. Therefore the Lord here as well as in the
thirty-second verse has used the term 'Madhya’' in common gender.
"
1241,"1186 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 10 -
It means, that there is nothing else, at the beginning, in the
middle and at the end, besides the Lord. The Lord pointed
out this fact, first in the twentieth verse then in the middle
in the thirty-second verse and at last in the thirty-ninth verse,
by declaring Himself as the seed of all beings. It means, that -
all is God (Gita 7/19). He has also declared that He becomes
manifold in different forms (Chandogya. 6/2/3) and He remains _
at the end, also (Srimadbha. 10/3/25). It means that He is in
the middle also. In this verse, in the thirty-second and thirty-
ninth verses, the Lord has mentioned His main glories, referring ,
to Himself. In other verses, His glories have been mentioned
as the head of a class, the controller of the group, or due to -
some special characteristic of that glory. So, a striver should :
always think, that all the divine glories are nothing, besides
manifestations of the Lord. He should behold only God, in all
of these, because Arjuna put the question, ""In what aspects -
are You to be thought of, by me” (Gita 10/17).
 ‘Ahamatma gudakeSa sarvabhiitaSayasthitah'—How should a
striver make use, of these divine glories? A striver, should think,
that the Lord has manifested Himself in all beings. He is the
beginning, the middle and the end of the whole universe. He _
is the seed of all of them. It means, that in the whole universe
there is nothing, besides Him.
Appendix—God is the beginning, the middle and the end
of all beings—it means that there is nothing else besides God
viz., all is God.
Lord Krsna is entire and the soul (self) is His divine glory.
The soul is the Lord’s ‘para prakrti’ and ‘antahkarana’ (internal
instrument viz., mind) is the Lord’s ‘apara prakrti’ (Gita 7/4-5).
Para and Apara—both are inseparable with God.

MaheSa. Lord Visnu holds the mark of his foot on His chest.
So, the Lord's glories, are revealed through him.
'Giramasmyekamaksaram'—First the monosyllable 'Om’, was

then the Vedas were revealed from Gayatri; and other scriptures
and Puranas etc., are based on the Vedas. So the Lord has declared ee

Comment:—

_*Aévatthah sarvavrksanam’—A¢vattha, is the pipala or holy :
fig tree. Every other tree can grow under it. It can grow, even

on very hard surface, such as a roof or a wall or on a mountain. -

Ayurveda, it is said to be a cure, for several diseases. So, it is -

recognized as, Lord's divine glory. |

'‘Devarsinam ca naradah'—The celestial sage, named Narada,

always works according to Lord's will. He becomes an instrument,

in the Lord's sport. He always sings of the Lord's glories and ;

virtues, on his harp. He inspired the sages Valmiki and Vy4sa,

to write the scriptures, such as the Ramayana and the Bhagavata.

Men, gods, demons etc., all have faith in him, and so they consult

him and do according to his advice. Therefore, he is a glory of

the Lord. | |

‘Gandharvanam citrarathah'—The celestial songsters and
musicians, are called Gandharvas, Citraratha is the most prominent

of all of them. He was a friend of Arjuna who learnt music, from |

him. So the Lord claims him, as His divine glory. |

'Siddhanam kapilo munih'—The Siddhas (the perfect ones)

are of two types—those who have attained perfection, by spiritual

discipline and those who have been endowed with perfection,

since birth. Sage Kapila, belongs to the second type. He emanated

Comment:— | -
""UccaihSravasamasvanam viddhi mamamrtodbhavam'—
When the ocean was churned, fourteen jewels came out of it.
Out of these, one of the jewels was Uccaihsrava. He is Indra's

as His divine glory. :
'Airavatam gajendranam'—Airavata is the best of all the
elephants. He was also born of the ocean, when it was churned.
He is also, Indra’s vehicle. So the Lord claims him, as His
divine glory.
""Naranam ca naradhipam'—A king, is regarded as the best
among men, because he fosters, preserves and rules over the
subjects. Moreover, he is regarded as possessing more divine power
than other human beings. So, he is called Lord's divine glory.* 7

thunderbolt as His glory. oo — _

'‘Dheninamasmi kamadhuk'—The celestial cow Kamadhenu
came out of the ocean while chuming it. This cow has the power
to supply all the requirements of the gods and men. So she is
said to be the Lord's divine glory. = a

""Prajanascismi kandarpah'—Kandarpa is Cupid, the god -
of sexual urge in beings. Progeny is possible because of this
urge. This progenitive instinct is to be revered if it is utilized |
for progeny by renouncing the sensuous pleasures. This urge is
His divine glory. In the eleventh verse of the seventh chapter
also the Lord declared, ""I am sexual desire not in. conflict with
virtue or scriptural injunction.""

‘Sarpanamasmi vasukih'—Vasuki is the lord of all serpents |
and is a devotee of the Lord. It was used as the rope to rotate |
the Mount Meru in the act of churning the ocean. So the Lord
speaks of this serpent as His divine glory. .

The singularity seen in these divine glories is the Lord's.

'Prahladascasmi daityanam'—'Daitya’ (Demons), were those

having any desire for the fruit. So, he is called a divine glory
of the Lord. } .
The Lord in the case of Prahlada, has used the present tense, :
because His devotees never die. They can be ever beheld by :
believers. Even when, they merge into the Lord, if a person
wants to behold them, the Lord appears, in their form. ~
'Kalah kalayatamaham'—Time, is the reckoner of the
appearance, stay and disappearance of things and beings, in the
universe. Therefore it is called a glory of the Lord: |
'Mrganam ca mrgendro'‘ham'—The lion is the lord of beasts. -
He is more powerful and courageous, than other wild beasts,

‘Pavanah pavatamasmi'—Wind is capable of purifying all

‘Ramah Sastrabhrtamaham'—Though Rama, is an incarnation
of God, yet as far as the wielders of weapon, are concerned, .
Rama is. the best of all of them. So the Lord has mentioned, -
Rama, as one of His divine glories.
'Jhasanam makarascasmi'—Among fish, the alligator is most .
powerful. Therefore the Lord names it as His divine glory. -
'Srotasamasmi jahnavi'—Among rivers, streams and waterfalls
etc., the Ganges, is the most sacred. Its water is holy, because |
it flows from the feet of Lord Visnu. Believers by beholding or
touching it, or drinking its water or bathing in, attain salvation.
If a dead man's bones are dropped into her, she leads him to -
salvation. So she is the Lord's divine glory. oo
A striver instead of attaching importance to the Lord's divine
glories, should attach importance to Him. .
In the seventeenth verse of this chapter, Arjuna put two
questions to Lord Krsna ""How may I know You,"" and ""In what

he should think of the Lord, in all His divine glories. The result

'Sarganamadirantasca madhyam caivaham'—The Lord Himself,
is the beginning, the middle and the end of all creatures. It

science of the self (soul) is the best. The same science in the

colophon at the end of the chapters of the Gita, has been called -

‘brahmavidy” = a |
The Lord calls ‘adhyatmavidya’ viz.,.the science of the self

as His divine glory because it is the simplest, easiest and is ,

directly realizable. to all. In practising it, in understanding-it and

in attaining it, there is no difficulty. Practice, understanding and |

attainment are not applicable to it at all. The reason is that it is

ever attained and in all the states—wakefulness, sleep and. sound -

sleep etc., it ever remains the same. The science of the self is ‘as

much evident as evident even this world is not there. It means -

that we can realize the science of the self very clearly, but we -

can’t realize the existence of the world so clearly. We should

understand this fact in this way. If we think of our childhood

and see our present state, we find that now the body is not

the same, habits are not the same, language is not the same,

behaviour is not the same, place is not the same, time is not the -

same, COmpanions are not the same, actions are not the same,

ideas are not the same, all these have changed but our entity

viz., the self has not changed, so we say, “I am the same who

was in childhood’’. It means that whatever has changed is of a

different nature and whatever has not changed is of a different

nature. What has not changed is the self (soul) and whatever

has changed is the body. This is ‘science (knowledge) of the |

self viz., ‘atmajiana’. : , |

I am, the all-destroying Death. I:am the origin of future
beings. Of females, I am Kirti, Sri, Vak, Smrti, Medha, Dhrti :
and Ksama (the goddesses), presiding over the qualities, --
fame, fortune, speech, memory, intelligence, steadfastness and
forgiveness, respectively. 34 _ Ce 7
Comment:— a

'Mrtyuh sarvaharascaham'—Death, has such an uncommon
power that after death, everything is destroyed and nothing remains,
in memory. Actually it is not death's power, it is the Lord's power.

Had death, not possessed the power of forgetfulness, a man -
would have been very much worried, about the relatives of previous
births and he might also have been attached to persons and things, |
with whom he had affinity, in the previous births. ~~ -

'‘Udbhavasca bhavisyatam'—As the Lord, is the sustainer of
all beings, He is the source of future beings. It means, that it is
He, Who creates the universe, sustains and destroys it.

""Kirtih Srirvakea nérinam smrtirmedha dhrtih ksama'— These
seven females are considered, the best of all women in the world. -
Out of them Kirti, Smrti, Medha, Dhrti and Ksama, are daughters
of Prajapati Daksa, Sr is the daughter of sage Bhrgu, and Vak is
Brahmé's daughter. Fame, prosperity, speech, memory, intelligence,
steadfastness and forgiveness are also, the seven most known,
female qualities. : :

A person achieves fame, because of virtues. Prosperity, can
be wealth, property and cattle, such as cows, horses, camels and
elephants etc. ,

Speech, enables a man to be called a learned. person.
Remembrance of something is memory. |

Intelligence, enables a man to fix something in the mind.
Steadfastness means, not to deviate from one's principles, and
beliefs etc. |

1257,"1202 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 10 -
. Forgiveness, 1s the quality of forgiving an offender, by
forgetting the wrong done, m spite of having the capacity and
opportunity, to avenge the wrong done.» =
‘The first three, of these qualities are. revealed outwardly,
while ‘the next four are revealed from inside the beings. The .
Lord, has named these as His divine glories. So
_ So, if these qualities are. seen anywhere, in any being, a :
striver should think of the Lord, by thinking these qualities as |
of the Lord. If a striver, finds them in himself, he should think ,
them, as Lord's, and not as his own, because they are divine
traits, which emanate only from the Lord. If a person, considers -
them his own, he feels proud of himself; and pride is a demoniac
propensity, which leads one toafall, 8 == ,
Strivers, should regard these excellent qualities, as the _
Lord's, just like Kakabhusundi, who by sage Lomaéa's curse,
was turned from Brahmana (the. priést class) to an untouchable
bird, a crow. But, he was neither afraid nor displeased; he was
rather pleased because, he thought that it was the Lord's will |
(Manasa 7/113/1). Thus, if a striver, starts beholding the Lord, ;
in all things, incidents, circumstances and creatures etc., it will
lead him, to bliss. _ | _

Samaveda, devoted to the praise of God, under-the name of
Indra. In 'Atiratrayaga’ it is a ‘Prsthastotra' (endorsed hymn). It
is regarded as the most prominent and best of psalms, in the
Samaveda. So the Lord speaks of it, as His divine glory.*
_ ‘Gayatri chandasimaham'—The Gayatri, is the most important |
of all the metres, contained in the Vedas. The Gayatri, is said to
be the mother of the Vedas, because the Vedas have emanated
_ from it. It consists of the trio of God—His form, His prayer |

Comment:— ee
'‘Dyiitamh chalayatamasmi'—The game of chance played for
money, property or kingdom etc., is called gambling. The Lord -
has called it His divine glory. | |
Question:—If gambling is the Lord's divine glory, it means
that there is no harm in gambling and then it should be justified. |
But then why is it forbidden, according to the ordinance of
scriptures? oe
Answer:—In this context, there is description of the Lord's :
divine glories, not of sanction and prohibition. Arjuna put the -
question, ""In what various aspects are you to be thought of, by :
me?"" So the Lord is answering his question by telling him, that
he should think of Him only, whatever he beholds in the form -
of His divine glories, because He declares, “All this universe is |
pervaded by Me” (Gita 9/4). >
Suppose a striver, in the past had the habit of gambling.
Now he is busy with adoration. By chance, he is reminded of
gambling. So he should think of God in it. Thus by beholding ;
the Lord in gambling, and the loss and gain involved in it, a
striver, will think only of the Lord. :
The man (soul), is a fragment of the Lord but by error he has
assumed his affinity with the body and the world. If he notices
the ‘excellences and the glories in the world, as the Lord's and
thinks of Him, it will lead him to God-realization (Gita 8/14).
On the other hand, if he regards the glories as belonging to the |
world and thinks of the world, it will lead him to complete ruin |
(Gita 2/62-63). These glories have been described so that a striver
by thinking of the Lord, may know Him, in reality.
 'Tejastejasvinamaham'—Tejas, is the glory or splendour of
great souls, who possess divine traits. In front of great men who
possess this glory, even sinners hesitate to commit.sins. So it
"
1260,"Verse 37] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1205 -
has been considered as the Lord's divine glory. :
'Jayo'smi'—Everyone, likes victory. So, victory is the glory
of the Lord. | |
‘A striver should not enjoy the pleasure of his victory by
regarding it, as the manifestation of his power, but he should |
regard it, as the manifestation of the Lord. | |
'Vyavasayo'smi'—Resolution or determination, is the Lord's
divine glory. A lot of importance, has been attached to it in the
Gita, ""The determination is one pointed"" (2/41); ""Those who
are deeply attached to pleasure and worldly prosperity do not 7
have the determinate intellect” (2/44); ""Even, if the vilest sinner :
worships Me, with exclusive devotion, he should be considered
a saint for he has rightly resolved"" (9/30).
A striver, should not regard this resolution (determination), _
as his virtue but should consider it as Lord's glory, which he
could cultivate only by, His grace.
‘Sattvarn sattvavatamaham'—The goodness of good persons,
is Lord's glory. The quality of sattva (goodness) which prevails,
suppressing rajasa (passion) and tamasa (ignorance), should not 7
be regarded, by a striver, as his own, but as the Lord's.
All virtues and achievements, such as glory, victory, resolution
and goodness, really belong to the Lord. So a striver, instead of |
considering these his.own, should consider them as the Lord's,
and so he should think of Him, only.

Being the most important of all sages, he has been declared by
the Lord as, His divine glory. So a striver, should think of the
Lord because all this distinction in him, is the Lord's. _

men who know the scriptural principles well. Sukracarya, was
the foremost of the learned. He was an expert, in the science
of reviving the dead. He is known for his science of ethics.

O Arjuna, I am the seed of all beings. There is no creature,
animate or inanimate, that can exist without Me. 39.
Comment:— | : Se oe

""Yaccapi sarvabhiitanam bijarh ‘tadahamarjuna'—Here the

Lord gives a gist of all His divine glories, by declaring that -

He is the seed or the cause of the entire, animate or inanimate
creation. By the term ‘seed’, He means that He is efficient cause,
as well as the material cause, of the entire creation. In other .
words, it can be said that He Himself is the creator, as well as, |
the creation. . |

In the tenth verse of the seventh chapter, the Lord declares :
Himself as 'the eternal seed’, in the eighteenth verse of the ninth -
chapter, ‘the imperishable seed’ and in this verse only 'seed'. It
means, that He in spite of remaining the same, manifests Himself
as the entire universe; and in spite of His manifestation, in the ""
form of the world, He remains, the same. __ |

""Na tadasti vina yatsyanmaya bhiitam caracaram'—In the
universe, whatever creature, animate or inanimate, moving or
unmoving, are seen these cannot exist, without, the Lord. All of
them, originate from Him i.e., He is manifest, in all of them. By :
knowing this fact, a striver should think of God alone in whatever,
he sees and whatever comes to his mind, and intellect.

Here, the Lord declares, that there is no creature, animate
Or inanimate, that can exist without Him, while in the fortieth
verse of the eighteenth chapter, He declares that there is no
existence, which is free from the three modes (sattvika, rajasika
and tamasika), born of matter (nature). The reason is, that here —
the context is of the Discipline of Devotion. Arjuna, put the
question, ""By what various aspects, are You to be thought of, by
me?"" The Lord answers, ""I exist in all the forms, which come
to your mind."" But (in 18/40) in the context of the Discipline
of Knowledge, in which, a striver should discriminate between
Matter (Prakrti) and soul. A striver, should renounce his core
"
1264,"Verse 39} - ~~  SADHAKA-SANJIVANI-.--  - = ~—=—«1209 :
affinity with matter. The entire universe; consists of three
modes, born of matter (nature). So the Lord, declares that there
is no existence, which is free from the three modes, born of
matter (Nature). Oo } -
| In this. chapter, the Lord has recounted His eighty-two divine ,

glories, from the tenth to the thirty-ninth verses. His purpose
in describing these is, not to mention that they are superior,
mediocre or inferior, rather He wants to draw attention of the
devotees, to the fact, that whatever comes to their sight or mind, -
they should think of, God only. The Lord, while describing his
eighty-two glories, means to say, that a striver, should think -
of God only, whatever thing, circumstance or person he comes_~_. _
across,* because, Arjuna put the question as to which aspect
He was to be thought of, by him (Gita 10/17). So the Lord,
has described His divine glories, in brief here. Similarly, in
the Srimadbhagavata also, (in the sixteenth chapter of the |
eleventh canto), Lord Krsna has described, His divine glories
to Uddhava. Some of the divine glories described, in the
Gita and the Srimadbhagavata, are similar while some of them
are not. In the Gita, He declares that among priests, He is
Brhaspati (10/24), while in the Bhagavata He states that among
priests, He is Vasistha (11/16/22). Now the question rises, why
the same speaker, Lord Krsna makes this distinction. The answer
is, that Lord Krsna while describing His divine glories, does
‘Not mean to attach importance to a thing or a person etc., but
He wants to say that a striver, should think only of the Lord, |
whatever thing or person he comes across, physically or mentally. |
Therefore, whatever distinction appears in any object or person,
should be regarded only, as the Lord's.

* Lord Narayana pervades the entire universe, which is seen or heard,
externally and internally.
"
1265,"1210 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 10 :

Appendix—All beings.are born in four different ways—

(1) Jarayuja—born with amnion from the womb as men, cows,
buffaloes, sheep and goats etc. (2) andaja—bom from eggs as birds,
snakes, squirrels and lizards etc., (3) Udbhijja—sprouting up from :
the earth as trees, creepers, grass, corn etc., (4) svedaja—born of =”
sweat as louse and tiny whitish louse etc., as well as those born
from the earth in rainy. season such as earthworms etc. From

these four sources eighty-four lac forms of lives are born. Out
of these there are two kinds—immovable and movable: Trees, |
creepers, grass and vegetation etc:, are immovable while men,
beasts and birds etc., are movable. Out of these beings some -
live in water, some fly in the sky and some others live on the |
earth. Besides them there are several other forms of lives such -
as gods, manes, gandharvas (celestial singers and musicians), _
ghosts, evil spirits, devils, demons, ‘pitana’ and ‘balagraha’ etc.
God is the seed viz., the root cause of all these beings. It means
that there are infinite beings in infinite universes but the seed
of all of them.is only one. Therefore-only God has manifested
Himself in all these forms-——~*Vasudevah sarvam’. | .

As seed is the origin of agriculture (farming), so is God the
origin of the entire universe. As from millet there is production of
millet; from wheat there is production of wheat; from an animal, |
animals are produced; from men, men are produced; similarly
from God, only God emanates viz., the Lord is revealed in the
form of the world. As in ornaments made of gold ‘there is only
gold, in the tools made of iron there is only iron, in the earthen-
wares made of clay there is only clay, in the cloths made of |
cotton there is only cotton, similarly the world emanating from .
God is the manifestation of only God. | ,

From the worldly seed, only one type of crop is grown. As
from the seed of wheat, only wheat is produced, other crops
such as millet, green lentil (miumga) and ‘motha’ etc., are not
produced. Their seeds are different. But God is such a seed from
"
1266,"Verse 40] _ SADHAKA-SANJIVANI © 1211 7

Whom different kinds of beings are born (Gita 14/4); and in spite :

of giving birth to the entire creation, there is no modification

or diminution in Him, He remains immutable because He is the

imperishable seed (Gita 9/18) and He is the eternal seed (Gita 7/10).

this is only a brief description by Me, of the manifestation of

Comment:— | | :

‘Mama divyanarh* vibhatinam'—The term ‘Divya’, stands for
singularity or uncommonness. If a striver, thinks of the Lord -
only, in whatever circumstances he is or wherever he 1s, that
singularity or divinity, is revealed to him, because there is none
else, as singular and divine, as the Lord. The gods who are called
divine, are also always eager to behold, the Lord (Gita 11/52).

It proves that the Lord is the most divine. So His glories, are

also divine. But the divinity of these glories, is revealed to a

striver, only when he has the sole goal, to realize God and _ he,

being free from attachment and aversion, thinks entirely of Him,
in order to know the reality of Divinity. | : |

* Arjuna first asked Lord Krsna to tell him His divine glories (11/16). So
Lord Krsna while starting the description said that He would tell him His divine -
glories (10/19) and while concluding the topic he again tells Arjuna that thereis =
no end of His divine glories (10/40). Thus the term ‘divine’ has been used in the
question as well as in the beginning and conclusion of the answer.
"
1267,"1212 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 10 -
""Nanto'sti'—There, is no end of the Lord's, divine glories.
As the Lord himself, is endless, so are His glories, virtues, sport
and discourses etc. Therefore, the Lord, while beginning His
divine glories and concluding them, has said, that there is no
end of His divine glories. In the Srimadbhagavata also, about /
His glories, He says that He can count the number of atoms
with the passage of time, but He, Who has created millions of
universes, cannot count, His divine glories. : ""
The Lord is endless, limitless and bottomless i.e., He is
beyond the limit of time, and space. oe
'Esa_tiddesatah prokto vibhitervistaro maya'—The Lord, -
describes His divine glories, in detail from the view-point of
Arjuna. But, from His view-point, this description is very. brief, -
because His glories are endless. _ a : _
' {In this chapter some of the glories of the Lord, have been
described. There may be other glories, which have not been
described here, but they can be related to strivers. Therefore,
whatsoever attracts the mind of a striver, should be regarded as
the Lord's divine glory, whether it has been described here or -
not, and he should think only, of Him.]
- Appendix—In the Gita the Lord has mentioned His seventeen
divine glories in the form of cause (7/8-—12), thirty-seven divine |
glories in the form of effect and cause (9/1619), twenty-five
divine glories in the form of persons (10/6), eighty one glories
in the form of principal and in the form of the ruler (10/20—38),
one divine glory in the form of essence (10/39) and thirteen
divine glories in the form of His influence (15/12—15). All this
means that there is nothing else besides God. In all forms, God
has manifested Himself. All this is the entire form of God. The
unreal is kaleidoscopic while the real is immutable. These—the
real (para) and the unreal (apara)—both are the Lord’s divine
glories—‘Sadasaccahamarjuna’ (Gita 9/19). It means that only God
has manifested Himself in the form of divine glories. Therefore
"
1268,"Verse 40] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1213 _
whatever attracts us, that is only the Lord’s attraction. But we
want to enjoy pleasures, so that attraction instead of changing into
love (devotion) for God, is changed into desire and attachment
which bind us to the world. .
In the Gita the Lord has called Brahma also ‘mam’ (His
own self) (8/13). He has also said ‘mam’ to gods (9/23), He has
also said ‘mam’ to Indra (9/20) and He has also said ‘mam’ to
Uttamagati (supreme goal) (7/18), He has also said ‘mim’ to
‘ksetrajiia’ (the self) (13/2), He has also called the indwelling
God as ‘mam’ (16/18) and He has also said the seed of all beings
as ‘mam’ (7/10) and so on. It means that God, Who is endowed -
with attributes and is also attributeless; Who is endowed with ;
form and is also formless; as well as men, gods, beasts, birds, 7
gods, evil spirits and devils etc.,—all combined together is the
entire form of the Lord viz., all are the divine glories of God, 7
all is His majesty.* All these divine glories are imperishable.
Here a doubt arises, when the entire universe is the
manifestation of God, then what is the purpose of the description-
repetition of His divine glories? The explanation is that the -
question of Arjuna was, “In what various aspects should I think
of You?” (10/17). In fact all is the entire form of God but the
_ thing in which a man sees some speciality, it is easy to behold
God and to think of Him in that thing, because mind is naturally
attracted towards the thing whose speciality is marked in the
mind. Therefore the Lord has described His divine glories. While
describing His prominent divine glories the Lord declared, “I am :
the beginning, the middle and the end of all beings and of the |
* sarve ca deva manavassamastassaptarsayo ye manusiinavasca
indrasca yo’ yam tridaSesabhiito visnoraSesastu vibhitayastah
(Visnu Purana 3/1/46)
‘All gods, Manu, seven great sages, Manu’s son and gods’ king, Indra etc.,
as well as whatever is there besides them—all of them are Lord Visnu’s divine
glories.’

entire creation” (10/20, 32), “I am the seed of all beings. There |
is no Creature, animate or inanimate, that exists without Me” (10/
' 39), and “I stand holding the entire universe in a fragment of My
body” (10/42), then what remains besides God? Nothing remains.
It means that all is God—‘Vasudevah sarvam’ (Gita’7/19). |
In the Gita the description of the divine. glories of God is
not of secondary importance -but it. is an important means for
God-realization which leads to ‘Vasudevah sarvam.’ The reason
is that if any speciality appears in the world and we regard it
as the Lord’s speciality, naturally we shall be attracted towards
God rather than towards that thing or person. Attraction or ;
attachment to matter leads to bondage—‘karanam gunasango’ sya
sadasadyonijanmasu’ (Gita 13/21). Therefore the purpose of the
description of the divine glories is that a striver may get rid of the
notion of the existence of the world, the value of the world and -
the lovability of the world and may realize ‘Vasudevah sarvam’
which is the main aim of the gospel of the Gita. |
| Existence of the world, its value and attachment to it, lead a
- men to bondage. If a man instead of being attracted towards the /
world, and instead of having the notion to enjoy pleasures out
of it, regards it as the manifestation of God, then the assumption
of the existence of the world, its value and attachment to it, will
be renounced and he will accept the existence of God, he will
value Him and will be attached to Him viz., will love Him.*

Every such thing that is glorious, brilliant or powerful, know |
that, to be a manifestation, of a spark:of My splendour. 41
Comment:— | So -
'Yadyadvibhitimatsattvarn Srimadirjitameva va'—Whatever |
glory, brilliance, power, beauty or any other singularity, appears |
in animate or inanimate things, and persons etc., should be known
as a manifestation, of a spark of the Lord's splendour—'tattadeva- ”
vagaccha tvari mama tejom'sasambhavam'. Without Him, there
is no singularity, anywhere. |
Therefore, whatever speciality a person observes, he should
regard it, as the Lord's and so think of Him, only. If he thinks,
that the speciality is of a person or a thing etc., he has a fall. If :
a chaste wife observes, something special in any other person,
except her husband, her chastity gets polluted. Similarly if a
devotee, perceives any singularity anywhere else except in God,
his exclusive devotion, is affected. a : |
Whatever beauty, glory or attraction, power or any other
quality, appears in an object or a being, it is only the Lord's.
How? If it had been, of a person or a thing, it might have
remained there forever. But that is not so. Then, whose is it? It
is Of the Lord, Who is the illuminator, the origin and the base
of all of these. One, who regards it as of a person or thing, gets
entangled in the world, and gains nothing. But if he, after a
serious thought comes to know the fact, that objects and persons
that are perishable, cannot possess those qualities, they are only
the Lord's, he attains bliss.
"
1271,"1216 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA == {Chapter 10
As electric current, works our radio but an ignorant person may
regard the sound coming only from the radio, without attaching
any importance to the electric current, while a person having
knowledge of it knows, that the radio works by electric power. _—-’
Similarly, an ignorant person, may regard the speciality of a person
and an object as theirs, but a wise man treats it as, the Lord's.
In the eighth verse of this chapter, the Lord declared that, He )
is the source of all the creation and from him all things evolve.
It means, that whatever glory, brilliance, power or any other
speciality, is seen, is of the Lord. Once, a saint heard a prostitute .
singing a song with a melodious voice. He cried, ""Oh! What a :
melody bestowed upon her, by the Lord!"" Thus the saint instead.
of paying attention to the prostitute, paid attention to the glory,
of the Lord. Therefore, wherever any beauty, excellence, quality -
or speciality appears, should be regarded as that of the Lord. But
it does not mean, that we should not feel thankful, to those who
have done good to us, with their qualities. We should be grateful
to them, and we should render service, to them. But we should not
get entangled in the world, by regarding these as belonging to them. ;
While describing His divine glories, from the twentieth verse
to the thirty-ninth verse, the Lord has used the term 'Asmi' (J),
several times, to lay emphasis on the fact, that He is the origin of
all divine glories. He has used the term 'Viddhi' (Know), two times,
once in the twenty-fourth verse, and the second time in the twenty-
seventh verse and 'Avagaccha' (Know), in the forty-first verse.
The term 'Viddhi' (Know), has been used to make us cautious.
A man becomes cautious, by knowledge and by a ruling power.
A preceptor, imparts knowledge, while a king rules with his
authority. In the twenty-fourth verse, the Lord mentions the name of
preceptor, Brhaspati. It means, that people should know the reality,
about His divine glories, through a preceptor. That knowledge
"
1272,"Verse 41] _. SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1217 -
will lead them to, unwavering devotion (Gita 10/7). In the twenty-
seventh. verse, the Lord by mentioning the king as His divine
glory, means to convey that we through the mling power of a
king, should follow the right path. viz., make our life virtuous.
To bring home something, a preceptor applies his love, while a -
king applies his power. A preceptor wants his disciple to attain
salvation, while a king wants his subjects, to obey the rules of
the country. — os
The terms 'Uccaihsrava' and 'Airavata’, in the twenty-seventh
verse, denote prosperity of the king. So the term 'Viddhi' (Know),
in this verse, specially seems to be used, for the king.
The term ‘Avagaccha' (Know), used in this verse, means :
to know the reality that whatever distinction is observed in the ;
universe, is only the Lord's. a |
Thus, by giving the term 'Viddhi', two times and 'Avagaccha' -
once, the Lord means that, so long as, a person does not carry out
the orders of the preceptor, and the king and try to. understand
reality, the knowledge imparted by the preceptor and the authority
of the king, will be of no avail, for him. If, he himself carries
out their orders, and knows the reality, then and then only, it :
can be useful for him.
Appendix—Besides the divine glories already mentioned, if a
striver is attracted towards any person or thing, there he should
behold God viz., he should firmly hold that that speciality is not
of a person or a thing but that is only God’s. When he firmly
believes that there is only God, the world will disappear in the
same way as when we hold that in ornaments made of gold, there
is nothing else besides gold, then existence of the ornaments
is lost; when we think that in the toys made of sugar, there is
nothing else besides sugar, then toys vanish. The reason is that
in fact the world has no existence. Only the man (self) because
of his attachment and aversion, has sustained the world ‘yayedarh
dharyate jagat’ (Gita 7/5). The gist of all this is that a striver has
"
1273,"1218 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 10 -
to attain the goal—‘Vasudevah sarvam’ (all is God). Therefore

the Lord according to ‘Arundhatinyaya’ has described His divine |

glories so that strivers may realize ‘Vasudevah sarvam’. because

when a striver beholds God in divine glories, then God will be

seen everywhere viz., there will be no attraction for things, but —_-

there will be attraction for God only because God has manifested |

Himself as things. Oo | ne

_ Whatever speciality or remarkability is possessed by man, that

is bestowed upon him only by God. If God had not possessed that

speciality or remarkability, how would He have bestowed it upon

the man? How can there be any speciality in the fragment (arhéa) -

which is not in the whole (arhéi)? A man commits an error that

he, by regarding the speciality as his own, gets proud of it and

does not pay attention to God, the origin (source) of the speciality.

. All things, persons etc., of the creation are perishing every —
moment. The speciality in the form of beauty and power etc.,
which is perceived also vanishes. Therefore everything of the
universe is preaching us the practical sermon, “Don’t look at me,

I’ll not stay forever but look at my maker Who has manifested ;
Himself in different forms and Who will stay forever. Whatever
beauty or power or remarkability is being perceived in me, that

is not mine but that is only His.” Having realized this fact,

we shall have no attraction for things and persons etc., but we

shall behold God in them. Thus there will not be ‘Bhoga’ viz.,
enjoyment of pleasures but naturally there will be ‘Yoga’ (viz.,
natural eternal union with God). _

God is the remarkable storehouse of all powers, arts and
sciences etc. Powers can’t stay in the inert Prakrti (matter) but
can stay in divine Godhood only. How can the knowledge, by
which all actions are being performed, stay in matter? If it is
assumed that there are all powers in Prakrti,:even then it will
have to be accepted that Prakrti has no ability to reveal those
powers and to use those powers (for the creation of the universe
"
1274,"Verse 41] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI — 1219 -
etc.). AS a computer in spite of being inert, works wonders but
it is made and conducted by the sentient viz., man. It can’t work
without being constructed, guided and conducted (directed) by
man. A computer has no independent existence but it is man-
made, while God exists by itself.
Had God not possessed special traits, how would have they
been inherited by beings? A particular trait of the seed is found
in that tree which grows from that seed. How will any special
trait, which is not in the seed, be possessed by the tree? The
poetic talent of a poet comes from God, the power of oration
of an orator comes from God, the power of charity in a donor
comes from God. He is the origin of all these powers. Salvation,
knowledge and love etc.—all have been bestowed upon us by -
God. This is not the evolute of nature. If ‘I am an embodiment of ;
salvation’——this is true, then how was I bound, when was I bound
and why was I bound? If ‘I am knowledge personified’—this is
true, from where was ignorance emanated, how was it emanated,
when was it emanated and why was it emanated? How can the
darkest night of ‘amavasya’ stay in the sun? In fact knowledge
is the possession of God, but a man has assumed it as his own,
thus ignorance has evolved.* ‘I am knowledge personified,
knowledge is mine’—This ‘Y’ and ‘mine’ (egoism and the
sense of possession) (aharhta-mamata) is ignorancef. When we
are not inclined towards the Lord Who has bestowed upon us
salvation, knowledge and love, then it appears that salvation is |
— * Knowledge or the power of knowing is not there in prakrti. Prakrti
never remains uniform but it is kaleidoscopic. If there is knowledge in Prakrti, |
that knowledge also instead of being uniform, will be kaleidoscopic. The
knowledge which ts born, will not stay forever but will be transient. If
_anybody holds that there is knowledge only in prakrti, we call that prakrti
God, there is difference only in words. It means that there is no knowledge
in prakrti, if there is, then that (prakrti) is God. ,

mine, knowledge is mine, love is mine. This is the singularity of
the Lord that He has endowed us with the things in such a way
that we think that they are ours. This singularity of God is an
- example for strivers which they should follow. A man commits
a blunder that he assumes the thing, which has been bestowed -
upon him by God, as his own; but he does not cast a glance
on the most gracious giver. He sees the thing received but he
does not see the giver. He perceives the action but he does not
perceive the cause by whose power the action could be done.
In fact the thing is not one’s own, but the giver is one’s own. |
. A man becomes a Karmayogi with the power conferred :
on him by God, he becomes a Jnanayogi with the knowledge -
bestowed upon him by God and He becomes a Bhaktiyogi

does not reveal the fact—this 1s His nature.

the Lord Himself reveals an important fact. |

single fragment, of Myself. 42 _ |
Comment:—
'Athava'—This term suggests something different, from what
has been stated already. By this term, the Lord means to say,
that He has already answered the question. Now, He wants to
tell him something remarkable, of His own accord.
"
1276,"Verse 42] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1221 -

'Bahunaitena kim jiatena tavarjuna'—Lord Krsna says, ""O
brother Arjuna! What need is there, to know all this in detail?
Though I am sitting before you‘as a chariot-driver, with the
horses’ bridle and a whip, :in My hands, to carry out your order,
yet I hold countless universes, in both the states of new creation -
and final dissolution, in a fragment of My body.""

'Vistabhyahamidarm krtsnamekamésena sthito jagat'—The Lord,
means to say, that He stands holding the countless universes, in |
a fragment of His body, through His Yogic power. But it does
not mean that, that fragment is occupied by countless universes,
and so that fragment is not empty. That fragment is still empty. :
As, with our intellect, we know several languages, scripts and art
etc., but it does not mean, that there is no more room in it; to -
know more languages and scripts etc. We can learn, several other
languages, scripts and arts etc., with it. When even our intellect, -
a small fragment of matter, is not filled with the knowledge, of
different languages etc., how can a fragment of the Lord, Who is
transcendental, endless, limitless and bottomless, be filled with,
countless universes?

Appendix—This verse means that God has manifested Himself :
in the form of the world because He is the pervaded as well as
the pervader. He is subtle as well as great, He is real as well as
unreal. He is infinite, therefore he stands holding the countless
universes in a fragment of His body—‘ekamsSena sthito jagat’.

The Lord wants to draw attention to the fact that Only He
is all. If a striver pays attention to Him, then he need not know -
and think of any divine glory. The Lord means to say, “When ,
I, Who am the base, support, illuminator and seed (root) of all -
divine glories, am sitting before you, then what is the need of
thinking of My divine glories?” |

At the end of the tenth chapter, Lord Krsna graciously said
to Arjuna, ""I hold countless universes in a fragment of My body
and yet I am sitting before you as a chariot-driver, with horses’
bridle and a whip in My hands and carrying out your wishes I
am the core of all the divine glories and Yoga (influence) and -
when I am sitting before you, what need is there for you to have
detailed knowledge of My divine glories""? After listening to the |
statement of Lord Krsna, Arjuna thinks of His special grace and
being wonder-struck, speaks. -

By this, profound discourse of spiritual wisdom that you
have delivered, out of compassion for me, my darkness has been
dispelled. 1
Comment:— |
""Madanugrahaya'—The Lord, out of grace declared, ""Out
* After thinking of the unusual grace of the Lord on him Arjuna was
overwhelmed with joy. So without keeping in mind the rule he spoke this verse
of thirty-three letters instead of thirty-two because when a man is beside himself,
he is likely to forget the rule. .
"
1279,"1224 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 11 -
of compassion, for those who worship Me, I destroy their
ignorance—bom of darkness"" (Gita 10/11). Arjuna, was
very influenced by His statement. So he offered praises to Him
(10/12—-15) and told Him, that it was only out of compassion,
that He revealed to him His closely guarded secret.*
'‘Paramarm guhyam'—The Lord, after describing His important
divine glories, at the end of the tenth chapter, told him of his
own accord, that He stood supporting the whole universe, with
a single fragment of his Self (10/42). Arjuna regards this fact,
as the supreme secret. |
'Adhyatmasanjiitam'—In the seventh verse of the tenth -
chapter, the Lord declares, that he who knows, in reality His
divine glories and Yoga-power (viz., He is the origin of all 7
divine glories and again those divine glories, merge in Him), _
he is endowed with unfaltering Yoga of devotion. This has been
called by Arjuna 'Adhyatmasanjnitam' (spiritual wisdom)T.
'Yattvayoktam vacastena moho'yam vigato mama'—Arjuna’'s
delusion, was that he did not know that the Lord holds the entire
universe, in a fragment of His body. But, when the Lord explained -
the fact to him, he came to know His uniqueness that though
countless universes emanate from a fragment of His body, they
remain established in it, and again merge in it, yet He remains,
the same. Arjuna said that his delusiont was dispelled, but the
Lord knew that his delusion was not totally dispelled. So again,
* Whatever Lord Krsna explained to Arjuna in the Gita from the beginning
to this stage was out of compassion only because all His actions are full of His
grace but a man does not realize this fact. When a man realizes His grace, he
attains Divinity very easily and quickly. When Arjuna realizes His grace, he
being overwhelmed with joy tells Him that it is by His grace that his delusion
is destroyed.
Tt Whatever has been said by the Lord about devotion so far, is the supreme-
secret-spiritual gospel.
¢ A man does not know delusion so long as he has it. But he knows it only
when it is dispelled.
"
1280,"Verse 2] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1225 ~
in the forty-ninth verse, the Lord says to Arjuna, ""Be neither
perturbed nor deluded."" | |
Appendix—Arjuna says to Lord Krsna, “Your utterance,
which You have made, is out of compassion for me rather than
to show Your learning. In it there is no other motive except .
Your grace alone.” )
‘I am the beginning, the middle and the end of all beings’
(10/20), ‘I am also the seed of all beings’ (10/39), ‘Everything
which is glorious, brilliant and powerful know that to be a
manifestation of a spark of My splendour’ (10/42), ‘I stand 7
supporting the entire universe with a single fragment of Myself -
(10/42)}—having heard these words Arjuna felt that his delusion
was destroyed. But in fact his delusion was partly destroyed, it |
was not destroyed totally.
Link:—How Arjuna's delusion was dispelled, is explained
by him, in the next verse. :

From You, O lotus-eyed, I have heard in detail, an account
of the origin and dissolution of creation and also of Your
immortal glory. 2
Comment:— |
‘Bhavapyayau hi bhitanarh srutau vistaraso maya'—The Lord |
declared, ""I am the origin (source) of the entire creation, and in
Me again, it dissolves. There is no other source, besides Me""
(Gita 7/6-7); ""Whatever beings, there are, born of sattva, of rajas
or of tamas, know them all, as evolved from Me alone"" (7/12);
""Diverse feelings, of creatures emanate, from Me alone"" (10/4-5);
"
1281,"1226 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 11 -
""I am the source of all creation; everything in the world, moves
because of Me"" (10/8); ""I am the beginning, the middle and

also the end, of all beings"" (10/20); and ""I am the beginning and

the end and also the middle of all creation” (10/32). So, Arjuna

says that he has heard in detail, an account of the origin and °
dissolution of beings. He means that all the beings evolve from

Him, live in Him and merge in Him ie., He is all in all.

'‘Mahatmyamapi cavyayam'—Arjuna wants to say, that he
also heard of His immortal glory, as explained by Him, in the
seventh verse of the tenth chapter, that he who knows in reality,

His divine power and glory, is endowed with unfaltering Yoga
of devotion. : a -

The Lord's glory, has been called immortal, because after
knowing His divine glory and power in reality, one is endowed
with devotion, which is immortal, because the Lord Himself is -
immortal, so devotion for Him, should also be immortal.

Appendix—In this verse Arjuna from his point of view tells
the reason how his delusion was dispelled. ‘Mahatmyamapi
cavyayam’—Here by the term ‘api’ it is interpreted that Arjuna
heard the Lord’s perishable glory and also heard His imperishable
glory. “Bhavapyayau hi bhutanam’—this is God’s perishable viz.,
changeable glory. A man may be connected with God in any
way—this will lead him to salvation—this is God’s imperishable
viz., immutable glory. It means that the real as well as the unreal,
all is only God—‘sadasaccaham’ (Gita 9/19).

Link:—In the next two verses, Arjuna requests Lord Krsna,
to vouchsafe a vision of His Cosmic Form. 7

O Lord Supreme, You are precisely what You have declared

Yourself to be. But, I long to see Your cosmic divine form, O

greatest of persons. 3

Comment:—
'‘Purusottama'—Arjuna addresses the Lord, as the best |

(Supreme) person, because no other person is equal to Him.

The same fact, has been pointed out by. the Lord Himself in the

fifteenth chapter when He declares, ""I am beyond perishable matter,

and superior to the imperishable soul. Therefore, I am known

in the world and in the Vedas, as the Supreme Person"" (15/18).
'Evametadyathattha tvamatmanam'—Arjuna_ says, that -

whatever has been spoken by the Lord about His virtues, glories

and divine powers, (from the seventh to the tenth chapters), is

wholly true, without any doubt. _
The Lord declares, ""I am the origin of the entire creation and

in Me again it dissolves"" (7/6), ""It has no other source, besides

Me"" (7/7), ""All is God"" (7/19), ""I am Brahma (the Infinite),

Adhyatma (Self), action, Adhibhita (Matter), Adhidaiva (Brahma,

the creator) and Adhiyajiia (the Unmanifest Divinity)"" (7/29-30). .

""I am the Supreme Person, attainable by exclusive devotion""

(8/22), “All this universe, is pervaded by Me, but I don't dwell

in the beings, nor do the beings, dwell in Me"" (9/4-5); ""I am,

being and non-being, both"" (9/19); ""I am the source of all creation

and everything in the world moves, because of Me"" (10/8) and

""I support the whole universe with a single fragment of Myself""

(10/42) etc. Arjuna says, that whatever has been said, by Him

is wholly true. _
'‘Parameévara'—Arjuna heard Lord Krsna says, ""I am Lord |

of all beings"" (4/6); ""I am the Supreme Lord of all the worlds""

(5/29). So Arjuna addresses Him, as the Lord Supreme, because

He is the Supreme Lord, of the entire creation.
'‘Drastumicchami te ripamaisvaram'—Arjuna tells Lord Krsna,

that after hearing of His immortal glory, he has a firm belief in
"
1283,"1228 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 11 -
His words; and after hearing the words, that He supports the entire
universe with a single fragment of His self, he has developed
an irresistible yearning, to see His Cosmic Form. |

Secondly, Arjuna says that though He is the Supreme Ruler _
of all the universes, yet it is very kind of Him to love him so
much, to act as he wishes and to answer whatever, he asks. It
is, because of His extraordinary kindness to him, that he has
developed an irresistible yearning to see that form, in whose
single fragment He supports the entire universe.

In the sixteenth verse of the tenth chapter, Arjuna requested
Lord Krsna to describe in full, His divine glories. In response to -
his question, Lord Krsna while describing His divine glories, in the
beginning and at the end, told him that there was no end to His
divine glories (10/19,40). So, He gave only a brief description. -
But, here Arjuna requests Him to show him His divine form
(only one), but Lord Krsna says to him, ""Behold in hundreds
and thousands, My multifarious divine forms"" (11/5). As in this :
mortal world, if a greedy person demands a lot, from a donor,
he gets only a little; but if he demands a little hesitatingly, the -
donor gives more. Similarly, first Arjuna requested the Lord to
describe His divine glories in detail, so He described in brief.
But, here Arjuna becomes cautious and hesitatingly prays to Lord
Krsna, to reveal that form to him, if He deems it fit. The Lord,
is influenced by this hesitating mood and asks him to behold
His multifarious divine form, in hundreds and thousands.

Also Lord Krsna while sitting in a part of Arjuna's chariot
said, ""In a part of this body of Mine, the entire creation (having ;
infinite universes) pervades."" So Arjuna, developed an irresistible
yearning to see that form of His.

Appendix—Arjuna means to say to the Lord, “O Lord! Having
heard Your words, I have understood You well and there is no
doubt about it. Only You are all—this is exactly the same. Now
only Your cosmic divine form is left to be seen.”
"
1284,"Verse 4] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1229 -
The gospel can be preached in two ways—by utterance and
by demonstration. In the tenth chapter the Lord described His
entire form and declared, “I stand supporting the entire universe
with a single fragment of Myself’. Now in this chapter Arjuna
requests Lord Krsna to show him His cosmic form. /

Comment:— |
'Prabho'—The term 'Prabho', means Omnipotent. Arjuna :
uses this vocative 'Prabho', for Lord Krsna to indicate, that He
is Omnipotent. So, even if he is not agreeable, the Lord, by
His grace and power could enable him, to have a vision of His :
divine form.
""Manyase yadi tacchakyam maya drastumiti'—Arjuna says to
Lord Krsna, that even if He does not reveal His divine form to him,
he will believe His words, that His form is the same as He has
described, but he is not qualified and deserving to behold it. Thus,
Arjuna does not doubt the Lord's statement in the least, rather he
has full faith in it. So he prays to Him, to reveal to him His divine
form, if He thinks it possible for him, to see it. :
""YogeSvara'—By using the address ‘Yogesvara’, Arjuna
says that He is the Lord of all Yogas (Disciplines), such as the
Disciplines of Devotion, of Action, of Meditation, of Knowledge
etc. So by His power, He could enable him, to behold His
divine Cosmic Form. :

Arjuna, in the seventeenth verse of the tenth chapter, used
the term 'Yogin' but now he uses the term 'YogeSsvara' (the Lord

_of Yoga) 1.e., the Master of all the Yogas, because now there is
a lot of change in his attitude, towards the Lord.

‘Tato me tvam darsayatmanamavyayam'— Arjuna prays to
Lord Krsna, to reveal to him His imperishable form, from which
infinite universes emanate, in which they remain established, and
in which they again merge. |

Appendix—The cosmic form of the Lord has been called
‘avyaya’ (imperishable) which proves that the entire universe
is the Lord’s manifestation. Being imperishable it does not cease :
to be totally (Gita 15/1). In fact the mutable (the unreal) and |
the immutable (the real)—both combinedly is the entire form
of God—‘sadasaccahamarjuna’. Insentience appears because of ”
one’s own attachment and ignorance.

The Blessed Lord said:

Behold My forms, O Partha (Arjuna), hundreds and thousands,
multifarious and divine, of various colours, sizes and shapes. 5
Comment:—

'Pasya me partha riipani SataSo'tha sahasraSah'—Listening to
"
1286,"Verse 5] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1231 .
the humble and hesitating prayer of Arjuna, the Lord, was very
much pleased with him. So He addressing him as ‘Partha’ (the
son of Prtha, Kunti), asks him to behold His forms, by hundreds
and thousands i.e., innumerable forms. Thus, the Lord explains
that as His divine glories are infinite, so are His forms.

'Nanavidhani divyani nanavarnakrtini ca'—Now, _ the
Lord describes the characteristics of those forms. They were
heterogenious in character, consisting of different shapes, colours |
and sizes.

_ As a particle of the earth, is earth in miniature, this world, |
being, a fragment of the Lord having a Cosmic Form, is nothing -
besides the Lord. But, it is not manifest to ail, in its divine
form, it is manifest only in its worldly form. It is so, because .
a man, instead of beholding the Lord, see only, the perishable -
world. As the Lord, even in an incarnation, is not manifest to
all (Gita 7/25), He appears, only, as a common man, to all;
similarly, the universal form of the Lord is seen as of the world, ;
by a common man. Here, the Lord by revealing Himself in His
divine imperishable Cosmic Form, calls upon Arjuna to behold, :
His divine forms.

Appendix—Arjuna, regarding himself as incapable
(undeserving) requests the Lord to show him His cosmic: divine
form if He so wills. But the Lord asks him to behold His hundreds
and thousands forms. It proves that, if something is left at God’s
will, it is more beneficial than what is desired with one’s own
will, and expected with one’s own intellect. The reason is that
a man may learn several sciences, arts and crafts etc., study .
several scriptures, yet his intellect is meagre and limited. The
more simple (innocent), helpless and free from pride a striver
is, the more he will know about God. Pride is an obstacle in the
way of knowing God. The more sensible a man thinks himself
to be, the more insensible he remains. By assuming himself
sensible, he becomes a slave to sensibility. The more free from
"
1287,"1232 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 11
the pride of sensibility he is, the more sensible he is.

'PaSyadityanvasiinrudranasvinau marutastatha'—The twelve
sons of Aditi are—Dhata, Mitra, Aryama, Sakra, Varuna, Améa, -
Bhaga, Vivasvan, Pisa, Savita, Tvasté and Visnu (Maha. Adi.

The Lord, calls upon Arjuna to behold them all, in His
Cosmic Form.

These thirty-three varieties of gods, are the principal ones. :
The forty-nine Maruts (wind-gods), are regarded as separate from
the thirty-three varieties of gods, because they were transformed
from demons to gods. So the Lord, has separated them from
other gods, by using the term 'tatha' (and) (also).

'Bahinyadrstapirvani paSyascaryani bharata'— The Lord, |
asks Arjuna to behold such marvels in those forms, which he _
might have neither seen, nor heard of nor imagined, nor thought
of. After beholding such forms, a person is wonder-struck and -
left aghast. : | : -

Appendix—In the preceding verse the Lord asked Arjuna to
behold His forms. of various kinds, colours, sizes and shapes
in His cosmic form; now in this verse He mentions the same
in detail.

The Lord means to say that all gods are His manifestations
only viz., He has revealed Himself in the forms of those gods
(Gita 9/23).

Mine, the entire universe consisting of both animate and inanimate
"
1289,"1234 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 11 -
beings and whatever else you wish to see. 7
Comment:— |
'GudakeSa'—Arjuna is addressed as 'Gudakesa because he
was the conqueror of sleep. The Lord by addressing Arjuna as _
GudakeSa, invites him to observe His cosmic form, attentively
giving up indolence. | .
'Thaikastham jagatkrtsnarhn paSyadya sacaracaram mama
dehe'—At the end of the tenth chapter, the Lord declared, that
He supports the whole universe, with a single fragment of His |
self. So, Arjuna developed a desire to see his cosmic form. |
Therefore, the Lord calls upon Arjuna to behold, within a part -
of His body the entire creation, consisting of both animate and
inanimate beings, while He is sitting in front of him with the
horses bridle and a whip, in His hands. The Lord says that in _
His body, wherever he looks, he will see, infinite universes. The
word 'Cara’ stands for all creatures possessing mobility, such as
men, gods, genies, demons, ghosts, beasts and birds etc., while
‘Acara', denotes things devoid of motion, such as trees, plants
and hills etc., and 'Adya', here means now. The Lord means to ;
say, that there is no reason for any delay, for Him to reveal His
cosmic form. So He reveals it, the moment Arjuna expresses
his earnest desire to behold it. :
""Yaccanyaddrastumicchasi'— By this expression, Lord Krsna
wants to convey to Arjuna, that he can perceive, not only the
incidents relating to the present, but also of the past, and the
future. Moreover, Arjuna had a doubt, whether they would win
the war or the Kauravas, would (Gita 2/6). So Lord Krsna asks
him to perceive at that moment, in a part of His body, a scene
of his own victory, and his enemy's defeat.
The Lord, in the seventh verse of the tenth chapter, declared, ,
""He who knows in reality, the divine glory and power of Mine,
"
1290,"Verse 7] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1235
is endowed with, unfaltering Yoga of devotion. ""Hearing this
statement, Arjuna by offering praise and prayer to Him, requested
Him to describe His divine glories. Similarly, by hearing the
| Lord's statement, that He stands supporting the whole universe
with a single fragment of His self, Arjuna prays to the Lord to :
reveal to him, His cosmic form. If the Lord had not made this
statement, Arjuna would have not prayed to Him, to reveal His
cosmic form. It means, that the Lord by His own grace, wants
to reveal to him His cosmic form.
A similar incident occurred, when Arjuna asked Lord Krsna
to place his chariot, between the two armies. Lord Krsna placed -
the chariot between the two armies in front of Bhisma and Drona
and said, ""Arjuna, behold these Kauravas"" (1/25). It indicates,
that the Lord wanted to preach the gospel, of the Gita. If the -
Lord, had not said so, and Arjuna had not seen his kinsmen, he
might not have grieved, and the Lord might not have preached
the gospel of the Gita. It means, that the Lord by His grace, has
preached the gospel of Gita, of His own accord.
Appendix—The Lord orders Arjuna to behold the entire
universe in a single fragment of His body. It proves that Lord
Krsna is entire and in a fragment of His body He holds the
entire universe. :
‘roma roma prati lage koti koti brahmanda’—
(Manasa, Bala 201)
The Lord is clearly showing this fact. When the Lord holds
the entire universe in a fragment of His body, then what remains
besides Him? All is only God. Therefore the Lord says to Arjuna, .
“Whatever you want to see, all this you can see in My cosmic
form.” Arjuna wanted to know the result of the war, which he saw
in the cosmic form of the Lord (the chief warriors were rushing |
head long into the Lord’s fearful mouths) (Gita 11/26-27).

_ Link:— The Lord, .in the previous three verses, called upon
Arjuna to behold His cosmic form, four times by using the term
'Pasya' (see). But Arjuna in spite of his best efforts could behold
nothing. So the Lord (knowing the cause of Arjuna's failure to
see that form), bestowing upon him a gift of divine vision, for :
him, to behold His cosmic form.

But you cannot view Me, with these human eyes of yours;
therefore I grant you divine vision with which, behold My divine
power of Yoga. 8 | : _
Comment:— |
'Na tu mam Sakyase drastumanenaiva svacaksusa'—Lord
Krsna, knew that His transcendent form, could not be seen,
with ordinary human eyes, because their power is very poor and
limited, and these can see, only the objects of nature such as -
men, beasts and birds etc., but cannot behold His form, which
is beyond the reach of senses, mind and intellect.
'Divyarm dadami te caksuh paSya me yogamaisvaram'— By
His power of Yoga, the Lord bestowed upon Arjuna the divine
faculty, in order to enable him to have a vision of the spiritual
objects, beyond the reach of sense-organs, as well as, His cosmic
form, with his human eyes.
The term, 'PaSya’, has two meanings—to see with intellect |
(discrimination), and to see with one's eyes. In the verse of the
ninth chapter, it is related perceiving with intellect, while here,
the context is of seeing with eyes.
Suppose the word 'Gita', is written somewhere. An illiterate
"
1292,"Verse 8] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1237 ~
person, just notices black marks, a man having knowledge of
letters, can see the letters, but an educated person who is a scholar,
and who has studied the Gita, thoroughly, after having a look at
the word ‘Gita’, thinks of its chapters, verses and its gospel etc.
Similarly, when the Lord bestowed upon Arjuna divine eyes, -
he could see the uncommon cosmic form of the Lord and its
divinity, which are beyond the power, of ordinary intellect.
Now, a doubt, arises, when Arjuna said to Lord Krsna, in
the fourth verse, ""If you think that it can be seen by me, then
reveal to me, Your imperishable form"", the Lord should have |
said as in the eighth verse, ""You can't see Me with your human =
eyes, therefore, I give you divine eyes."" But, the Lord ordered
him to behold His cosmic form. When he was unable to behold -
that form, the Lord bestowed upon him divine eyes. Why? .
The Lord has done so, in order to indicate how His grace
extends to strivers, by degrees. Actually, the Lord is very much
gracious. He showers His grace, upon His devotees, in various -
strange manners. In the Gita the Lord, through his preachings.
by changing his attitude, towards his duty, described His divine -
glories, and aroused curiosity, in Arjuna. So by Lord's inspiration,
Arjuna prayed to Him, to tell him once more, in detail, His
power of Yoga and His glories, for he knew no satisfaction
in hearing His sweet words. Having described His glories, the
Lord announced that He stood holding the entire universe with a
single fragment of His self. So Arjuna, prayed to Him to reveal
to him His cosmic form, with infinite universes. Thus the Lord
revealed His cosmic form, and ordered Arjuna again and again,
to behold it. But, when Arjuna was unable to view the cosmic .
form, the Lord bestowed upon him divine eyes. It means that,
when a devotee takes refuge, in the Lord, He shoulders the whole
responsibility, of meeting all needs of the devotee.
Appendix—The verb ‘pasya’ has two meanings—‘to know’
and ‘to see.’ In the fifth verse of the ninth chapter this term in
"
1293,"1238 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 11 -
the expression ‘pasya me yogamaisvaram’ has been used in the
sense “to know’ and here the expression ‘pasya me yogamaisvaram’
this term means ‘to see’ the cosmic form of the Lord. It means
that whatever is to he known, is God, and whatever is to be seen,
is also God. There is nothing else besides God. In this chapter :
_ there is singularity of seeing the Lord’s divine form rather than its
description. Therefore Safijaya at the end of the Gita mentioned
the singularity of the dialogue and also the singularity of the
Lord’s cosmic form (18/76-77). |

The Lord’s cosmic form was divine, therefore the Lord :
endowed Arjuna with divine eyes to behold His divine form. sO

O King, having spoken thus, the Supreme Lord of Yoga, Hari

Comment:— :

'Evamuktva tato..........rupamaisvaram'— Evamuktva'’, denotes
the topic of the preceding verse, when the Lord declared, ""You
beheld the Lord's cosmic form (Gita 18/77). Now Safijaya, describes this cosmic
form to Dhrtarastra.
"
1294,"Verse 10] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1239 :
can't see Me with your human eyes, therefore I give you divine
eyes. With these behold My divine power, of Yoga.""
In the fourth verse, Arjuna addressed Lord Krsna as the
Lord of Yoga, while here Safijaya addresses Him as the Supreme .
Lord of Yoga. It means, that the Lord revealed His hundreds
and thousands of multifarious divine forms, while Arjuna wanted
to behold only one. If a devotee, has a little inclination towards
the Lord, He by His limitless power, enhances that inclination.
The form, which was called by Arjuna, in the third verse, as
divine, has been called by Safijaya here, as supremely divine. |
It means that the Lord Krsna, the great Lord of all the Yogas, -
reveals such an uncommon, singular, and wonderful ‘cosmic form,
that even such a valiant, steady and self-controlled warrior, as .
Arjuna, who has been granted divine vision by the Lord, has
to say it is hard to gaze at (11/17), ""My mind is tormented by -
fear' (11/45), and the Lord had to console him by asking him
to be free from fear (11/49).
Appendix—Safnjaya calls Lord Krsna ‘mahayogesvara’ by
which he means that Lord Krsna is the Lord of all Yogas. There
is no Yoga whose lord He is not. All Yogas are within Him. :
Arjuna called Lord Krsna ‘Yogesvara’ (11/4), but Sanjaya
calls Him ‘mahayogeSvara’. The reason is that Sanjaya already
knew Lord Krsna really and more deeply than Arjuna knew. More
than Sanjaya the Lord was known to Vedavyasaji. It was by the
grace of Vedavyasaji that Sanjaya heard the dialogue between
Lord Krsna and Arjuna—‘vyasaprasadacchrutavanetadguhyamaham
param’ (Gita 18/75). More than Vedavyasaji1, the Lord knew
Himself by Himself (Gita 10/2, 15).

'Anekavaktranayanam'’—All the mouths and eyes of the -

cosmic form.
'Anekadbhutadarganam'—In the cosmic body of the Lord,

'Anekadivyabharanam'—All the ornaments of diverse forms on
hands, feet, ears, noses and necks in the cosmic body of the Lord,
were divine, because the Lord revealed Himself in ornaments.

hands, many divine weapons, such as discus, club, bow, arrows
and spear etc.
'‘Divyamalyambaradharam'—The Lord in his cosmic form,

'Sarvascaryamayam devamanantam viSsvatomukham'— The
cosmic body, revealed by the Lord, was infinite and unbounded by
space and the innumerable faces, forming part of that body covered
all sides. Everything in the cosmic form, was wondrous.
If a man thinks that he is bathing in the Ganges at Haridvara,
though there is neither Haridvara nor the Ganges, yet his mind
forms different images of Haridvara, the Ganges, bridge and -
people bathing there, similarly, the Lord manifested Himself in
numberless forms, with ornaments, weapons, garlands, clothes
and perfumes etc. _
It is mentioned in the Srimadbhagavata, that when
Brahma, the creator, stole some calves and the cowherds of
Lord Krsna, the Lord manifested Himself, not only as calves
and cowherds, but also as canes, horns, flutes, clothes and
ornaments (Srimadbha. 10/13/19). -
Appendix—In the second chapter there is mention of the
marvellous nature of the soul which is a fragment of God (Gita

""Divi suryasahasrasya bhavedyugapadutthita yadi bhah sadrsi _
sa syadbhasastasya mahatmanah'—As the light of thousand stars, |
twinkling together in the sky, cannot be compared with the light
of the moon, and as the light of a thousand moons, cannot be
compared with the light of the sun, similarly, the splendour of a

‘thousand suns shining all at once, in the sky, cannot be like that
of the cosmic form, of the Lord. It means that the splendour of |
the Lord was incomparable. The reason is, that the effulgence of -
the sun is material, while the splendour of the Lord was divine.
So, the splendour belonging to two different categories, cannot
be compared, only an indication can be given. Therefore, by .
referring to the brilliance of a thousand suns, Safijaya is, hinting
at the effulgence of the cosmic form.

Appendix—The light (splendour) of a thousand suns shining
all at once in the sky, can’t match the radiance of the Lord
because the radiance present in the sun has also emanated from .
God (Gita 15/12). There may be the light of thousands of suns,
but that light is material while the Lord’s light is not material
but divine. | : |

Arjuna saw the stalk of the lotus and also the place, from where
the lotus sprang up. It shows that he had a vision of Visnu, the
progenitor of Brahma. He also saw Lord Siva, sitting in his
"
1301,"1246 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 11 -
abode, under the banyan tree, on mount Kailasa.
| ""RsimSca sarvanuragamsca divyan'—Aruna, beheld the
gages, living on the earth and divine serpents, living in the
underworld.
In this verse, Arjuna's statement affirms that he beheld, the
three worlds—the earth, the paradise and the underworld, in
Lord Krsna's body, with three division concentrated at one place
(Gita 11/13). Besides them, he also beheld the abodes of Brahmi,
Visnu and Mahe§a, as well as, those three chief deities. This is
all due, to the glory of the divine eyes, bestowed by the Lord.
When Lord Krsna declares, that He holds the entire universe .
in a limb of his body, Arjuna prays to Him, to reveal His divine
form to him. So Lord Krsna asks him to behold the entire universe, -
in His one limb (11/7). Safijaya who was offered divine vision
by Vedavyasa, also declares that Arjuna saw in the person of
that Supreme Deity, comprised in one limb, the whole universe,
with its manifold divisions (11/13). But Arjuna, here (Gin 11/15)
declares that he beholds multitudes of different beings; he does :
not use the expression ‘Ekastham’ (resting at one place). The
_ reason, is that wherever Arjuna saw, he beheld, only His cosmic
form. At that time, Arjuna did not look at the Lord, Who was
acting as his chariot-driver. So he beheld only, his cosmic form.
But the Lord revealed the entire universe in his one limb, and
Safijaya also beheld the Lord sitting as a chariot-driver, in the
chariot as well as, His cosmic form. So, both of them, use the
term, 'Ekastham’ (concentrated at one place).* :
Now a question arises, in which limb according to Lord
Krsna, as well as Sanjaya, Arjuna, beheld the cosmic form.
* The term 'Ekastham’ (concentrated at one place) has been used both by the
Lord and by Sajfijaya. So it should be assumed that Arjuna also beheld the cosmic
form in a limb of the Lord. ,
"
1302,"Verse 16] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1247 7
The answer is, that it 1s very difficult to mention a particular
limb, because millions of universes, are held in a pore of
His body. It means, that He holds infinite universes, in each of
His limbs.* :
Appendix—Arjuna in the cosmic form of God sees gods, 7
living beings, Brahmaji, Lord Visnu, Lord Sankara, sages, celestial
serpents and the multitude of different beings. It means that Arjuna,
while sitting in the mortal world, sees the abode of gods, the
abode of Brahma, the abode of Lord Visnu, Kailasa, the abode
of Lord Siva and the world of celestial serpents etc. Therefore
whatever is said and heard, all that is held in a fragment of -
God. God may be endowed with form or He may he formless,
He may be the biggest or the smallest, He remains endless. The |
entire creation is born of Him, resides in Him and merges into
Him, but He ever remains the same. -

1303,"1248 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 11 ”
Comment:— |

Arjuna uses, two vocatives 'Visvaripa’ (Universal Form),
and 'VisveSvara' (Lord of the universe), to convey that this
universe is nothing but His manifestation, and that He is also
the Lord of the entire universe. The body of a human being, /
is insentient, while its master, the soul is sentient. But, there
is no such distinction in the cosmic form of the Lord. In this
form, everything is sentient. By the vocative 'Visvaripa’, Arjuna
declares, that He is the body and by the vocative 'ViSvesvara' 7
Arjuna means, to say that He is the master of the body. |

‘Anekabahiidaravaktranetram'—Arjuna saw the Lord, with _
countless arms, bellies, mouths (faces) and eyes.

'Pasyami tvam sarvato'nantaripam'—Arjuna, saw His ”
innumerable forms, extended on all sides. _

‘Nantarh na madhyam na punastavadim'—The cosmic body,
as was revealed to Arjuna, was infinite, on all sides. Arjuna
could know neither its beginning, nor middle, nor end, because
there was no limit in it. |

Arjuna, first used the term ‘end’, because he wanted to see -
the end of His body, on ail sides, to know His stature. But, when
he was unable to see it, he tried to see the middle and then the
beginning, but it was of no avail. The order in which Arjuna
viewed cosmic form is related here by this expression.

Appendix—Here is the description of the endlessness of the —
Lord’s cosmic form. Even His fraction is also infinite. As in ink,
is there any place where there is no script? In gold, is there any
place where there are no ornaments? Similarly what is not there |
in God viz., naturally all is there in God.

'Kiritinarn gadinam cakrinam ca'—The Lord's cosmic form,
retained the famous emblems, club, discus and also diadem. Here =.
the term 'Ca' (and), should denote conch and lotus. Thus Arjuna
could behold the four-armed Lord, also in that cosmic form. -
'Tejorasim'—The cosmic form of the Lord, was a mass of
splendour i.e., there was unlimited glitter in that form. Sanjaya
also, described His splendour in these words, ""If there were the
effulgence of a thousand suns blazing forth, all at once in the sky, /
that would hardly be, like that of the mighty Lord” (11/12).
‘Sarvato diptimantam'—Being effulgence incarnate, the Lord
was shining everywhere, on all sides. |
'Pasyami' tvam durniriksyam samantaddiptanalarka-
dyutimaprameyam'—This brilliance of the cosmic form, of the
Lord, was like that of blazing fire and sun. As brilliance of sun,
dazzles the eyes, the lord's also dazzled the eyes; the eyes could
not bear its sight. [Here it is surprising that though Anuna was
blessed with divine eyes, to behold that form, yet it dazzled him, .
because of its most wonderful effulgence.] 7
The splendour and effulgence, of the Lord, was limitless
and immeasurable on all sides, and no other splendour can stand
comparison with it.

‘Durniriksyam’—-Though Arjuna was blessed with divine
sight by God, yet Arjuna was not fully capable to see the cosmic
form of the Lord. It proves that God cannot be known even by
the power bestowed upon a man by God. Even God doesn’t

You are I recognise, the Imperishable, the Supreme Being

are the eternally imperishable Being. 18
Comment:—
‘Tvamaksaram paramarh veditavyam—The Lord is_ the |
imperishable Supreme Being, who is attributeless and formless,
and Who has been described in the scriptures, as the absolute
or Brahma, and Who is realized by liberated souls. .
'Tvamasya viSvasya param nidhanam'—Arjuna says, that the
Lord is the ultimate resort or support, of the entire universe. At
"
1306,"Verse 18] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 1251 _
final annihilation, the entire universe merges in Him and at the
beginning of new creation, it emanates again from Him. Thus
He is the final resort (abiding place), of the entire universe.
(Here Arjuna. offers praises to the Lord, Who is formless, and
is endowed with attributes.) .
'Tvam Sasvatadharmagopta'—Arjuna says, that when there
is, a decline of righteousness and rise of unrighteousness, the
Lord by an incarnation, destroys the evil and protects 'Sanatana
Dharma’, the Dharma that has existed, since time immemorial
and shall exist forever. [Here Arjuna offers praises, to the Lord,
endowed with attributes and form.] |
'‘Avyayah sandtanastvam puruso mato me'—Arjuna assumes -
that the Lord is the eternal, imperishable Being, the almighty |
God, Who remains imperishable, even when the entire universe,
perishes. ~
Appendix—Here the expression ‘tvamaksaram paramar
veditavyam’ denotes attributeless and formless Brahma; the
expression ‘tvamasya viSvasya pararn nidhanam’ denotes God
endowed with attributes and formless; and the expression ‘tvam
Sasvatadharmagopta’ denotes God endowed with attributes and ;
form. It means that ‘nirguna-nirakara, ‘saguna-nirakara’ and
“saguna-sakara’—these all joined together, is the entire form of
God, having known which nothing remains to be known (Gita
7/2) because there is nothing else besides Him.

Lord from the fifteenth verse to the eighteenth verse Arjuna in
the next two verses describes fierceness, terror and power of
the cosmic form.

Comment:— | | |
_ ‘Anadimadhyantam'—Arjuna saw the Lord, without a -
beginning, middle or end 1.e., He had no limits.
. In the sixteenth verse, Arjuna also said, ""I see, neither Your
beginning, nor middle, nor end."" This statement conveys the -
infinitude of the cosmic body i.e., infinitude in space, while
in the nineteenth verse, it is in the context of the infinitude of
time. It means, that the Lord, is beyond limits of time, space |
and causation. All, the space, time and causation, are within
Him. Then how can He be encompassed by space, time and 7
causation. In other words, He cannot be measured, by space,
time and causation.
‘Anantaviryam'—Arjuna, wants to convey, that the Lord's
power, strength, glory and energy, are unlimited.
'Anantabahum'*—The Lord is endowed, with numberless arms.
'SaSisiiryanetram'— The sun and the moon, which illuminate
the entire universe, are the Lord's eyes. Thus, the universe is
illuminated by His light.
'Diptahutasavaktram'—The Lord's mouth, is the blazing fire,
* In the sixteenth verse Arjuna said that the Lord had numerous arms while
here he says that He is endowed with infinite arms. It seems that there is repetition.
But actually it is not so. There is the description of the divine (mild) form of the
Lord while here is the description of His fierce and terrible form.
"
1308,"Verse 20] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1253 _
which receives various articles offered, when religious sacrifice,
is performed.
'Svatejasa viSvamidarh tapantam'—The Lord warms the
universe, with His radiance. It means, that persons, things
and incidents etc., that create unfavourable and undesirable -
circumstances, to torture beings, and those who are affected
by those circumstances are, fragments of the cosmic form, of
the Lord.
Appendix—This verse means that God is endless in all ways.
The universe, which is scorched by the Lord’s blazing fire is
not different from Him. Therefore He, Who scorches with the -
blazing fire, and the universe, which is scorched with that blazing
fire—both are the manifestations of God. -

Comment:— |
‘Mahatman'—By this address, Arjuna means to say, that His
self is the greatest of all. None can equal it.
'Dyavaprthivyoridamantaram hi vyaptam tvayaikena diSasca
"
1309,"1254 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA (Chapter 11 -
sarvah'—The entire space, between heaven and earth, is filled,
with the Lord.
The Lord is all-pervading, He pervades all the ten quarters—
east, west, north, south, east-north, north-west,west-south, south-
east, upward and downward.
| '‘Drstvadbhutam rupamugram tavedam lokatrayarm
pravyathitam'—[Arjuna having described the frightening form
of the Lord, in the nineteenth verse and in the first half of the
twentieth verse, now starts describing the result of beholding
this form.] Seeing, a dreadful, uncommon, marvellous and
resplendent form, of the Lord, all the beings inhabiting the
heaven, the earth and the netherworld, are greatly alarmed and -
are trembling with fear. |
Though Arjuna has mentioned of the heaven and the earth,
yet he has used the expression, 'the three worlds,’ which may -
include the netherworld, also. The reason, is that Arjuna did
not behold these systematically one after the other. He saw the |
heaven, the earth and the netherworld etc., altogether and so he
is describing these in the same manner, in which he beheld.
Now a doubt arises, why were the three worlds greatly
alarmed and trembling with fear? Did the beings of the three
worlds, also behold, the cosmic form? And if they beheld, it
then how? |
The clarification is, that Arjuna beheld those three worlds
within the cosmic body of the Lord. Those three worlds, were
greatly alarmed and were trembling with fear, after noticing the
terrible beasts, such as lions, tigers, snakes, as well as, death in
His cosmic body. |
In fact, the entire universe is a fragment of the cosmic form,
of the Lord. The transience and modifications that appear in the
universe, are nothing but, the sport of the Lord. The Lord, as
"
1310,"Verse 21] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1255 © 7
well as his cosmic form, has His independent existence, while
the universe has no independent existence of its own. Arjuna saw
the cosmic form of the Lord,.with divine eyes, while devotees
perceive this universe, as the manifestation of the Lord.

A passionate person, seeks pleasures in the universe, while a |
devotee who has nothing to do with mundane pleasures, beholds
it as Lord's manifestations. As a child, regards the same woman
as its mother, a father, as his daughter, a husband as his wife,
and a lion as his prey, similarly the world, appears true with
human eyes, transitory, with discriminating eyes, and divine with
emotional eyes, and a fragment of the cosmic form seen with 7
divine eyes. |

Appendix—The term ‘tvayaikena’ used in this verse means °
“only You have revealed Yourself in numberless forms— _
‘Vasudevah sarvam’. No one can count Your numberless forms
but in all of them only You prevail.”

In God there are several kinds of wonders. He is endless
from different view-points such as space, time, thing, person,
form, knowledge and Yoga etc. Whichever we have neither seen -
nor heard, nor known nor understood and which is beyond our
imagination—all that is within the Lord’s cosmic form.

‘Ami hi tvarh surasangha visanti'i—When Arjuna went to
heaven, he became familiar with the gods there. So Arjuna |
says, that these gods were entering the Lord's frightening form. Bo
All of the gods, are born of Him, remain established in Him, -
and again merge, in Him.

'Kecidbhitah praiijalayo grnanti'—Hosts of gods, were entering
the Lord's terrible form. The remaining gods, were much afraid -
of meeting the same fate. With joined palms, therefore, they
began to utter the Lord's names, glories and praises.

Though the gods, being afraid of death, viewing the man-lion

_ incarnation (which was within the cosmic form), were singing
praises of the Lord. But to Anuna, it seemed that these gods :
being terrified of the cosmic form, were resorting to praising |
the Lord, in His cosmic form. ,

'Svastityuktva maharsisiddhasanghah stuvanti tvam stutibhih |

living in the abode of gods and other great sages, such as Sanaka
and Sanandana etc., as well as the gods, were extolling the Lord
by means of sublime hymns. —

Appendix—Deities (gods), sages and emancipated souls etc.,
all are the organs of the Lord’s cosmic form. Therefore those
who are entering the Lord’s form, those who are terrified, those
who are chanting the Lord’s names and glories, are none else
but God; and also He in Whom they are entering, by Whom
they are terrified, Whose names and glories they are chanting

The seven manes are—Kavyavaha, Anala, Soma, Yama,
Aryama, Agnisvatta and Barhisat (Siva Purana, Dharma. 63/2).
They are called 'Usmapa, because they eat hot food. :
'Gandharvayaksasurasiddhasangha'—The Gandharvas, are
said to be born of KaSsyapa's three wives, named Muni, Pradha

and Arista. They are experts in the art of different melodies and
music. They are musicians, of the heaven. |

The Yaksas, are said to be born, of KaSyapa's wife Khasa.

The ‘Asuras' (Demons), are the ‘Daityas, Danavas and .

etc., are known as Siddha. |

'Viksante tvarn vismitaScaiva sarve'—All, the above-mentioned
gods, manes, Gandharvas, Yaksas, were gazing at the Lord, in
amazement. All of them, were limbs, of the cosmic form, of |
the Lord. oe

are the organs of the entire form of God. Therefore the onlooker

Comment:— |

[In the Lord's cosmic form, from the fifteenth verse to the
eighteenth verse, there is a description of the Lord's divine
form, from the nineteenth verse to the twenty-second verse, of
his terrible form and from the twenty-third verse to the thirtieth -

verse, of His very dreadful form.] :

‘Bahuvaktranetram'—The Lord's, mouths and eyes in His
dreadful cosmic form, were of various sizes, shapes and expressed
different moods. :

‘Bahubahirupadam'—The arms, thighs and feet, were also BC
of different sizes, shapes and colours etc., and their movements :
were also unusual.

‘Bahudamstrakaralam drstva lokah pravyathitastathaham'— |
After beholding the terrible teeth, in the Lord's mouths, the worlds _
were terrified, and Arjuna also was terror-struck.

Arjuna had already described, numerous arms, eyes, bellies,
faces of the Lord's cosmic body, and also the terror in the three |
worlds, after beholding these. Then why is He repeating it?

There are several reasons for doing so. “

(1) Arjuna beholds a novelty and singularity, in each phase,
of the cosmic form. |

(2) After having a vision of the Lord's cosmic form, Arjuna
was so much confused and alarmed, that he did not remember
what he had already described, and so he repeated it.

(3) First, he spoke of the three worlds, feeling greatly
alarmed after beholding the terrible form of the cosmic body.

But, here he says that he was also terrified at the sight of the
Lord's, terrible cosmic form.

(4) When a man is overwhelmed with emotions of fear or
joy, of sorrow or surprise, he repeats, a word, a phrase or a
sentence several times. After seeing, a cobra, a man being afraid
of it cries, ‘A cobra! A cobra! A cobra!’ Similarly, a person
"
1315,"1260 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 11 -
left alone, on an island, may describe his loneliness by saying,
""Alone! Alone! All alone,"" and so on. Thus Arjuna has repeated
the words out of fear, joy and surprise etc. Arjuna admits this
fact, when he says, ""Having seen Your form which was never
seen before, I feel delighted and my mind is distressed with fear""
(11/45). It means, that this is no mere, repitition.

Appendix—Those who are beholding and those who are
being beheld, those who are terrifying and those who are being
terrified—all those beings and also Arjuna himself are within
the cosmic form of God. ) ,

When I see Your form, touching the sky, effulgent in many
colours, with mouths wide open, with large shining eyes, my heart
trembles with fear, I lose courage and find no peace, O Visnu. 24 |
Comment:—

(In the twentieth verse, Arjuna described the Lord's height
and breadth, while here he describes His tremendous height, only.]

'Visno'—Arjuna says that it was the all-pervading Lord
Visnu Himself, Who incarnated as Krsna, in order to lighten
the burden of the earth.

‘Diptamanekavarnam'—The Lord's terrible cosmic form, was
multicoloured and effulgent.

'Nabhahsprsam'—His form was so tall, that it was touching
"
1316,"Verse 24] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1261 -
the sky. It means, that as far as Arjuna could see he beheld the
cosmic form of the Lord meeting the sky. It indicates, that even
divine sight could not have access to the end, of the limitless
cosmic form of the Lord.
'Vyattananam diptavisalanetram'— Just like a wild beast, the :
Lord's mouth was wide open, to ingest the entire universe. _
His eyes were large, shining and fiery.
'Drstva hi tvarh pravyathitantaratma dhrtim na vindami Samar
ca visno'— Arjuna says, that he was very much frightened at the |
sight of the Lord's cosmic form, and he lost his courage, self CO
control and peace of mind. _
Here a question arises, that Arjuna besides being a valiant
warrior of extraordinary calibre, was blessed with divine eye by :
the Lord, yet he trembled with fear, while beholding the Lord's _
cosmic form, but Sanjaya was not terror-struck. Why?
The answer is, that saints say that Bhisma, Vidura, Safijaya and
Kuntt, knew the Lord in reality, while Arjuna did not know Him |
fully. Arjuna's, delusion was not completely destroyed (11/49). So,
he trembled with fear. But Safyaya, knew the reality, about the Lord -
viz., he had delusion. So Safijaya was not terror-struck.
It proves, that the Lord and saints, shower their grace,
even on unqualified and undeserving persons, but qualified and
deserving persons, know the reality about Him, in the same way,
as a mother loves her innocent child more than she loves a
grown up son, while the grown up son knows her and her loving
nature more than an innocent child. The Lord, loved the simple
and innocent cowherds, cowherdesses and cows, more than He
loved the liberated souls, though the latter knew His tme self.
Similarly, Safijaya deserved to have a vision of the Lord's cosmic
form, and so he could behold, it without requesting the Lord,
while the Lord Himself had to arouse curiosity in Arjuna, and
revealed to him this cosmic form, as Arjuna regarded the Lord
as his friend, not as the Lord. So the Lord, was more gracious
"
1317,"1262 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 11 :

to Arjuna and it was by His grace, that Arjuna's delusion was
destroyed (Gita 18/73). It proves, that the Lord by His grace,
destroys the delusion, of His devotees. |

Appendix—Here the term ‘nabhahsprsam’ denotes the infinity

'Darhstrakaralani ca te mukh4ni drstvaiva kalanalasannibhani'—

Arjuna says, that seeing the Lord's frightful faces on account of
their terrible teeth, and flaring like the raging fire at the time
of universal dissolution, he was terror-stricken.

'Diso na jane na labhe ca Sarma'—Beholding, such a terrible |
form of the Lord, Arjuna, could not know, even the four quarters
of the world. The quarters, are discerned with the help of, sun-
rise and sun-set. But the sun was shining, the Lord's eye, situated
within His cosmic form. Moreover, the splendour of the Lord,
was more than even the effulgence of a thousand suns, blazing

forth; all at once (11/12). So, he knew not the four cardinal

_ directions. So being utterly amazed and confused, he lost
happiness and peace. :

'Prasida devesa jagannivasa'— He is the Lord of the gods and 7
Abode of the entire universe. So the gods and men etc., being
terrified, invoke the Lord only. After beholding the frightening
form of the Lord, being terror-struck, Arjuna thought, that the
Lord was displeased and angry. So he prayed to Him, for His
pleasure and kindness.

Appendix—The Lord, being pleased with Arjuna, is showing Se
him His cosmic form (Gita 11/47), but having seen the terrible -
and frightening form of the Lord, Arjuna has the false notion
that the Lord is displeased with him. So he prays to Him to be :
pleased with him. . _

chief warriors were rushing headlong into the Lord's fearful
mouths.

between the teeth, with their heads crushed. 26-27
Comment:— . |
'‘Bhismo dronah  sitaputrastathadsau  sahasmadiyairapi -
yodhamukhyaih'—Arjuna says, that the chief warriors on their
side, such as Dhrstadyumna, Virata and Drupada etc., believed in :
righteousness and were prepared to wage the war, regarding it as _
their duty. All these warriors, as well as Bhisma, Drona, Karna
were rushing headlong into the Lord's mouth. Arjuna mentions
these three names, of the rival army, to explain that they also :
joined the army, as a part of their duty.* |
* Bhisma—Bhisma is a very well-known figure in the history of the world for -
his vow of life long celibacy and renunciation of his claim to his father's throne
in order to facilitate his father's marriage with Satyavati. He was so firm in his
vow that he fought against his preceptor ParaSurama. Lord Krsna had vowed that
he would remain unarmed. But when Bhisma vowed that he would compel Lord
Krsna to be equipped with weapon, He had to take up arms, once a whip and the
second time a disc and run towards Bhisma.
Drona—Drona ate Duryodhana's food. So it was incumbent upon him to
fight, thus he joined the battle regarding it as his duty. But at last listening to the
gods he withdraws himself from the battle thinking of his duty as a Brahmana
(a member of the priest class). He was so impartial that he taught his own son, :
ASvatthama how to set Brahmastra (a weapon or missile which caused infallible
destruction and was used and withdrawn by chanting sacred formulas) in motion
only while to his disciple Arjuna he taught both how to set it in motion and how
to withdraw it.
Karna—Being a bosom friend of Duryodhana, he fought on his side. Even
when Lord Krsna disclosed to him that he was Kunti's son, he refused to give
up the cause of Duryodhana. Moreover he asked Lord Krsna not to disclose the
"
1320,"Verse 26-27] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1265 .

‘Am! ca tvam dhrtarastrasya putrah sarve sahaivavanipala-
sanghaih'—Those kings who were well-wishers of Duryodhana,
and were ready to fight on his side, as well as Dhrtarastra's
hundred sons—Duryodhana and Duhéasana, etc., were rushing
headlong, into the Lord's mouths, having terrible teeth. :

'Kecidvilagna . daSanantaresu sandrsyante ciirnitairutta-
mangaih'—Some warriors were ingested by the Lord, but some
of them were seen sticking in the gaps between the teeth, with
heads crushed. -

Here a doubt arises, as to how, Arjuna saw the warriors - |
rushing headlong into the mouth of the Lord's cosmic form, when -
they were arrayed alive, on the battlefield? The clarification is,
that the Lord asked Arjuna to behold whatever else he desired :
to see, in His cosmic form (11/7). Moreover, Arjuna had a doubt _
whether they or their enemies would win (2/6). So Arjuna, could
foresee their own victory, in the Lord's cosmic body. The same
fact, will be pointed out by the Lord, in response to Arjuna's -
question (11/32—34). _ ,

Appendix—Arjuna, in the cosmic form of the Lord, is -
beholding the imminent future. The Lord is beyond the limit of
time, so in Him the past, the future and the present—the three __
are only present (Gita 7/26).

LSS —

Link:—In the next verse, Arjuna describes those notable
secret to Yudhisthira otherwise he, regarding him as his elder brother, would
handover the kingdom to him and who would hand it over to Duryodhana. So the
Pandavas would lead a miserable life forever.

His charities were imcomparable. One day Indra, the king of the gods, in
Arjuna's interest, begged him to make a gift of his natural armour and earrings
attached to his body. With great delight he tore his armour and earrings from his
body and gave them away. Kunti asked him not to kill anyone of her sons in the
war. He promised not to kill her four sons but he would fight against Arjuna who
could either be killed or would kill him. Even if Arjuna died, she would have five
sons (including him viz., Karna).

'Yatha nadinarh bahavo'mbuvegah samudramevabhimukha
dravanti'—The source of the water of a river is, ocean. Water
evaporates from the ocean, falls as rain, on the earth and shapes :
as rivers. So, rivers have a natural tendency to flow towards
the ocean and finally lose their names and identity, by merging
with an ocean. In fact, they had no identity of their own, even
in the past, but they merely appeared separate, in the form of
the flow of rivers.
""Tatha tavami naralokavira visanti vaktranyabhivijvalanti'—Just
like, rivers, all the creatures rush towards the Lord, to attain
eternal bliss. But, some of them by identifying themselves with
the perishable and unreal body, are engaged in worldly pleasures
and prosperity, and thus by error, accept their separate existence.
But there are other valiant devotees who, not taking any heed
for pleasures and prosperity, march towards God, in order to,
attain the goal of human life. Bhisma and Drona etc., were such
valiant warriors, who entered the Lord's mouths, blazing with

who being engaged in worldly pleasures and prosperity, joined the
war in order to gain praise and kingdom, illustrated by moths.

As moths out of their folly rush headlong into the burning -
fire for destruction, even so, do these people, hurriedly speed into
Your mouths for their annihilation. 29
Comment:—

""Yatha pradiptam......samrddhavegah'—Moths, living in green
grass, in the dark night of rainy season, being enamoured of
blazing fire, in order to get light, rush into the blazing fire, for
their destruction. If a person, out of pity extinguishes the fire,
they feel very sad, because they foolishly think, that they have .
been deprived of a great gain.

""Tathaiva nasaya visanti lokastavapi vaktrani samrddhavegah'—
Worldly people, generally hanker after worldly pleasures and
prosperity and they also think of these. Such warriors were
Duryodhana, his co-warriors and such other kings, who were
"
1323,"1268 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 11 -
entering the Lord's blazing mouths, for their destruction i.e.,
they were paving their way, for eighty-four lac forms of life,
and hell. It means, that generally people, hanker after worldly
pleasures, prosperity, praise, honour and rest etc. In order to,
gain these they have to bear insult, dishonour, loss, worry and -
internal burning sensation etc., yet they yearn for these.*
Appendix—In the preceding verse there is the illustration of
rivers and in this verse there is the illustration of moths. Moths
out of their folly, being enamoured of blazing fire, themselves
rush into the blazing fire in order to enjoy light, but rivers :
_ flow towards the ocean in order to merge in it and to lose their - /
separate identity. Therefore those men who have a desire ‘to
take’ are like moths and the men who have a desire ‘to give’ |
are like rivers. The feeling ‘to take’ is insentience (matter) and
the feeling ‘to give’ is sentience (consciousness). When a man -
has the notion ‘to take’ from others, then forbidden actions are
performed by him but when a person has the notion ‘to give’ _
to others, then virtuous actions are done by him. He, who has a
desire ‘to take’, goes to heaven (paradise) while he who has a
desire ‘to give’ attains salvation. The reason is that the feeling :
of ‘getting’ from others leads to bondage while the feeling of
‘giving’ to others leads to salvation. :
Link:—Having described, the entry of the warriors into the
Lord's mouths, Arjuna, now in the next two verses, describes the

burming and tormenting the entire universe. |

Appendix—Here the Lord by using the terms ‘lokansamagran’

(all the worlds) and ‘jagatsamagrarh’ (insentient and sentient, :
unmoving and moving beings of the world) means to say that
all these are within the entire form of God.

In the Gita, God has been called ‘samagra’—‘asarnéayarh
samagrarh marh’ (7/1), actions have been called ‘samagra’—‘yajfiaya- :
caratah karma samagramh’ (4/23) and 1n this verse the world has
been called ‘samagra’. It means that all are the manifestations
of God.

Link:—Having viewed the Lord's cosmic form, in its most
terrible phase, in which warriors were rushing headlong for their _
destruction, Arjuna was terrified and also filled with curiosity,
to know Who Sri Krsna really was, and what He proposed to
do. So he put a question.

Supreme Deity, be kind. I wish to know You, the Primal One, in your -
essence (tattva), for I do not understand Your objective. 31
Comment:— | |
'‘Akhyahi me ko bhavanugraripo namo'stu te devavara -
prasida'—Arjuna says, that the Lord revealed Himself in His
divine form, as well as the fearful form, and Arjuna, could not
know the reality about Him. So, he asked Him, who He was. :
Beholding such a terrible form, what could he do, but bow down
his head? So he bowed deeply to Him. Having a vision of His -
terrible form, licking the people on all sides, Arjuna prayed to
Him, to be merciful to him.
'Vijiidtumicchami bhavantamadyarh na hi prajanami tava
pravrttim'—The Lord, first of all incarnated Himself, in his cosmic
form (in the form of the world). So he has been addressed as
the Primal One. Arjuna could not know the Lord's motive, in
revealing that divine form, as well as the terrible form, in His
cosmic body. So he wanted to know, His motive in that revelation
- and also what He wanted to do, afterwards.
Now a question arises, that the Lord's first incarnation was in
the cosmic form (in the form of the universe), and here Arjuna
beheld His cosmic form, in a limb of His body. Are both of His
forms the same or are different? The answer is, that it is only the
Lord who knows the reality; yet after reflection, it seems that the
"
1326,"Verse 32] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1271 -
universe was also within the cosmic form, which Arjuna beheld.
When it is said, that the Lord pervades everywhere, it means
that he pervades the infinite universes, within and without, this
universe. All these universes, are held, in one of His limbs.
Appendix—Having seen the grand terrible form of the Lord,
Arjuna is so much terrified and perturbed that he asks his friend
Sri Krsna Who He is!

Comment:— .
[After reflection, the Lord's cosmic form, seems very
extraordinary, because even for Arjuna, possessing the divine
eyes it was hard to look at (11/17). Being terrified, Arjuna asked
him Who, He was. It seems, that if Arjuna had not put this
question to Him, He might have continued to reveal Himself,
"
1327,"1272 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 11 -
to him. But when Arjuna, questioned Him, He ceased revealing
Himself and answered his question.) | | :

_""Kalo'smi lokaksayakrtpravrddhah'—In the preceding verse,
Arjuna asked the Lord, Who He was. So the Lord replied, that -
He was the mighty world-destroying Time.

‘Lokansamahartumiha pravrttah'—Arjuna, said to the Lord,
that he did not know His purpose, what He wanted to do. So
the Lord answered, that He wanted to exterminate, the warriors |
of the two armies. — oe

""Rte'pi tvam na bhavisyanti sarve ye'vasthitah pratyanikesu —
yodhah'—Arjuna had said that he would not fight (2/9). So Lord -
Krsna says, that even without him, the warriors arrayed in the |
hostile army will not survive, because He Himself is bent upon
their destruction, and their chances for survival, are nil. Moreover, -

| he himself has seen that the warriors of both the armies were
rushing headlong, into His terrible mouths. .

Here a doubt arises, that Arjuna saw the warriors of both
the armies, rushing headlong into the Lord's mouth, why does |
the Lord, refer only to the warriors of the hostile army that
they will not survive, even without him? The clarification is
that Arjuna while fighting, was going to kill the warriors of
the hostile army. So, the Lord says that even if he does not kill |
the warriors of the hostile army, they will not be spared; their
destruction is inevitable. .

Now, another doubt arises as to why warriors such as

Aévatthama etc., were saved. The clarification is, that the Lord .
talks only about those warriors, who would be killed by Arjuna.
The Lord means to say to Arjuna, that the destruction of those
warriors of his hostile army, who would be killed by him, is
inevitable because they have already- been slain by Him, he
should become, merely an instrument (11/33). .

Comment:— -
'Tasmattvamuttistha yaSo labhasva'—The Lord, says to Arjuna
that he himself has beheld, that his rivals will be inevitably slain.
So he should, gird up his loins and win glory and fame. But,
he should not regard the victory as the fruit of his efforts, as
he will be bound (Gita 5/12) because profit and loss, fame and
defame etc., are destined, by the Lord. So a man, should not
get entangled in them.
The expression 'YaSo labhasva’ does not mean, that he should — -
get elated by winning fame through victory. He should rather
think, that his opponents had already been killed by the Lord,
so fame was gained, as was destined. It was not the result of
his efforts, otherwise he would be bound. |
‘Jitva Satrinbhunksva rajyam samrddham'—An affluent
"
1329,"1274 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 11 -
kingdom, involves two factors (i) Thére should be no enemy

or rival. (ii) It should be rich and prosperous. The Lord, says to
Arjuna that after getting victory over his enemies, he will enjoy

such an affluent kingdom. To enjoy the affluent kingdom does

not mean that he should enjoy riches. But it means, that the
kingdom to which ordinary men are attracted, can be acquired

by him easily. : :

""Mayaivaite nihatah piirvameva'—The warriors of Arjuna’'s
hostile army, have already been slain by the Lord, because their ,
days are numbered. } -

‘Nimittamatrarn bhava savyasacin'—Arjuna, was called SO
‘Savyasacr because he could shoot arrows with his left hand,
also. Addressing him by this term, the Lord asks him to shoot
arrows with both of his hands 1.e., he should fight heart and -
soul with full courage, valour and intelligence, carefully by
becoming merely His instrument and he should not feel proud
of his victory because, they have already been slain by Him.

A striver, should also apply his intellect and power etc., for
God-realization. But he should not be proud, of his resources and :
devotion etc. He should think, that he wiil attain Him only, by His
grace. The Lord declares, it in the Gita, ""A devotee performing
all actions, by My grace, attains the eternal, imperishable
Abode"" (18/56); ""Fixing your mind on Me, you will by My :
grace, overcome all obstacles"" (18/58). Thus a striver, without
having any pride, by His grace, attains Him. Every person, while
performing his duty, should try his best but he should not be
proud of his success, in the least. When Lord Krsna, raised the
Govardhana, he asked the cowherds also to support it, with their |
sticks. The cowherds thought that their sticks were supporting
the Govardhana, but actually it was the nail of the little finger
of the Lord's left hand, which supported the Govardhana. When
they felt proud, the Lord moved his finger a little downward,
and the Govardhana began to slip downward. So, all of them
"
1330,"Verse 33] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1275 tw
cried, ""O brother Krsna, help us."" The Lord, asked them to apply
their full strength. But, when they found their efforts futile,the
Lord raised the mount up, with His finger. So, if a man by
becoming an instrument in the Lord's hands, without having :
pride of his power, and without having a desire for the fruit of ~
his actions, performs his duty, he may attain salvation. A striver,
meets with failure, due to his pride. If he does not have pride,
he can attain salvation, instantly. The pride in his efforts, is a
stumbling block to his attainment. Therefore, the Lord advises
Arjuna, not to feel proud, but regard it as His grace. Whatever is .
to happen will certainly, happen. It cannot be checked by a man, Se
with his power. So, he should remain equanimous, in whatever -
happens, as a result of his actions. By doing so, he will attain
salvation, because bondage, damnation to hell and degradation, |
to eighty-four lac. species, is the result of misdeeds, whereas -
salvation, liberation, beatitude and divine love etc., are natural
and self-evident. |

Appendix—‘Nimittamatrarh bhava savyasacin’—By this
expression the Lord does not mean that Arjuna should perform
actions nominally but it means that he should apply his full power ;
but he himself should not take the credit of his victory viz., he
should make the best efforts but he should not feel proud of his
achievement. Whatever power, knowledge and capability have
been bestowed upon a striver by God, he should fully apply
them but he can’t attain God by applying his power. He will
be attained by His grace only.

God is showering His grace most graciously on us. As a calf
draws milk only from one udder of the cow, but God has provided ""
her with four udders. Similarly God is showering His grace from
the four sides. We have to become merely an instrument in His
hand. Arjuna had to fight in the war, therefore the Lord asks
him to fight by merely becoming an instrument and he will get
victory. Similarly we have the world before us, if we practise
"
1331,"1276 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 11 -
spiritual discipline by becoming merely an instrument, we shall
get victory over the world.

Comment:— .
""Dronam ca bhismam ca jayadratham ca karnam tathanyanapi
yodhaviran may4 hatamstvar jahi'—Lord Krsna, exhorted Arjuna -
to fight by giving up fear, because Drona, Bhisma, Jayadratha,
Karna and such other valiant warriors,* however formidable they
might be, they stand already slain by Him: So he should get
victory over them, without being proud of his victory. |
'Ma vyathistha yudhyasva'—Arjuna considered it sinful, to
kill his preceptor, Drona and patriarch Bhisma. So the Lord
asks him not to be distressed with fear of violence. He should
perform, his duty of waging war, as he is a warrior belonging
to the warrior class.
* Bhisma, Kama and Drona were well-known for the bravery throughout
the world. So it was diffficult to get victory over them. Jayadratha was not such
a valiant warrior, but he was armoured with the boon that he who dropped
his severed head on the ground, would have his own head smashed into a
hundred pieces. |
"
1332,"Verse 34] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1277 -

'Jetasi rane sapatnan'—Arjuna, was not sure whether they
would win the war, or they would be vanquished by the enemy
(Gita 2/6). So the Lord, while revealing His cosmic form to him,
said to him, ""Behold within this body, whatever else you desire
to see"" (11/7). He saw scenes of his victory and the enemy's -
defeat. Arjuna, also beheld Bhisma, Drona and Karna, the valiant
warriors of the hostile army rushing headlong into the Lord's body.

So, He declares, that he will conquer, his enemies in battle.

A striver, gets discouraged when he finds himself incapable SO
of controlling worldly temptation and removing evils. So, the -
Lord encourages him, by declaring, ""Be not distressed with fear. |
Fight, you will conquer, your enemies."" So a striver, having no
pride of his own, by depending on the Lord, should perform -
his duty. If he is worried about the enemies, it means, that he
has pride of his own. Moreover, he should not be worried about 7
evil thoughts, if these come to his mind, because they are all
perishable, and have been destroyed, by the Lord. So a striver, ;
should not attach importance to them.

""Kall those, who stand already killed, by Me""—this statement
of the Lord arouses a doubt, that if someone kills a person it
means, that he is killed only by the Lord. Thus, does the murderer .
incur no sin? The answer 1s, that no one is authorized to slay
others, or to trouble them. He has a right, only to serve others,
and give comfort to them. If one had the right to kill others, ;
there would not be any value, of a sanction and prohibition. So,

a person, who murders others or tortures them, certainly incurs, :
sin. But a member of the warrior class, who by giving up pride

and selfishness, joins a battle, as sanctioned by scriptures, incurs

no sin, because it is his duty.

Appendix—Lord Krsna says to Arjuna that all the valiant
warriors have already been slain by Him. This should mean that
"
1333,"1278 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapterl1
a striver’s attachment and aversion, desire and anger etc., have .
already been destroyed viz., they have no existence. We ourselves
have given them existence, have valued them and have accepted
them in ourselves. In fact they have no independent existence
at all—‘nasato vidyate bhavah’ (Gita 2/16). :
7 Link:—Beholding the very terrible cosmic form of the
Lord, Arjuna asked Him, in the thirty-first verse, who He was
and what He wanted to do. In the thirty-second verse, the .
Lord answered, that He was the mighty Time, and came to TO
destroy the world. Then in the thirty-third and thirty-fourth -
verses, the Lord asked him to fight, consoling him that he
would win, because his enemies had already been killed by Him.
Sanjaya, now reveals to Dhrtarastra, Arjuna's reaction to the -
Lord's exhortation.

Comment:— a
“Etacchrutva vacanam keSavasya  krtafjalirvepamanah
kiriti—Arjuna, was terror-struck, after beholding the Lord's
terrible cosmic form. He was more terrified when the Lord
declared, that He was the mighty Time, Who would destroy all 7
the warriors. So, he began to tremble and bowed to Him, with
joined palms.
Arjuna helped Indra, the king of the gods, by killing demons
Kala and Khafija etc. As a token of his pleasure, Indra placed a
divine diadem (Kirita), possessing the brilliance of sun, on his -
head. So Arjuna is called 'Kiriti' viz., the crowned one. Here, ~
the same Arjuna, who helped Indra by killing huge demons, was
trembling with fear. |
'Namaskrtva bhiya evaha krsnamsagadgadam bhitabhitah
pranamya'—Time, is Lord's destroying power, which always -
keeps on devouring all beings without exception. When Arjuna,
beheld the terrible form of the Lord, he thought that Lord Krsna ;
is the master of that Time (Death), which devours the entire
universe. So, except Him, there was no saviour, to protect him,
from the clutches of Time (Death). So Arjuna, bowed deep to -
Him, again and again. :
'Bhiiya'—By this term, Sanjaya means to say, that from the
fifteenth verse to the thirty-first verse, Arjuna offered praises to
the Lord and bowed to Him, and now again he begins to offer
his praises to Him and bows to Him.
Voice, gets faltered and choked, out of fear, as well as joy.
If Arjuna had been too much terrified, he could not have uttered
any words. It shows, that Arjuna was not, too much terrified. .

Arjuna said: _

O Omniscient Lord, it is but apt that the universe exults, -
and is filled with love. by chanting Your. names and glory;
terrified demons are fleeing in all directions, and all the hosts of
Siddhas (perfected souls) are bowing to you. 36
Comment:—

[It is observed, that a man being overwhelmed with terror,
cannot speak. But Arjuna though terrified is offering praises to
the Lord, from the thirty-sixth verse to the forty-sixth verse. How?

The answer is, that after beholding the cosmic form of the Lord, -
Arjuna was terrified, as well as delighted, as he himself says, ""I

feel delighted, that I have seen what was never seen before; at

the same time, my mind is confounded with fear"" (11/45). It
proves that Arjuna was not so much overwhelmed with terror,

that he could not offer praises, to the Lord.]

'Hrsikesa'—'Hrsika’ means senses and ‘Iga’ means master, so
'HrsikeSa' means the Lord of the senses viz., God. It means, that |
the Lord is the conductor of senses and mind etc.

'Tava prakirtya jagatprahrsyatyanurajyate ca'—People of the
world, by having a disinclination for the world, chant the names
and glory of the Lord, narrate His activities and listen to these.

By doing so, they are delighted. It means that people, by having
an inclination for the world, develop attachmemt, aversion and
burning sensation etc., while, by chanting the Lord's names and
"
1336,"Verse 36] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1281 -
glories, they attain peace and delight. oo

When the Lord incarnates, all the sentient and insentient
beings, such as gods, human beings, sages, birds, beasts, trees,
plants, rivers and streams etc., are delighted. Similarly, all of
them are delighted, by chanting the Lord's names and glories. :
When they get delighted, by chanting His name and glories i.e.,
their minds get engrossed in Him, then they develop devotion
for Him. , |

'Raks4msi bhitani diso dravanti'— All the demons, giants,
ghosts and evil-spirits, etc., flee in different directions, out of -
fear when, Lord's names and glories, are chanted.* They flee, .
due to their own sins, not due to hearing of the Lord's names
and glories. ,

It is because of their sins, that their ears cannot hear most _
pious, auspicious names and glories, of the Lord. But, if they
stay there and listen to His names and glories, they become free,
from their base life and attain salvation.

'Sarve namasyanti ca siddhasanghah'—The perfected souls,
saints and strivers, by chanting the Lord's names and glories and :
listening to His sports, bow to Him.

All these scenes and sports are being revealed by the Lord,
in His divine cosmic form.

‘Sthane'—Arjuna, shows propriety of the above-mentioned
actions of beings, because an inclination for the Lord, leads
to peace and bliss, while disinclination for Him, leads to
disquietude and distresses. It means, that a being (spirit) is
a portion of the Lord, and so he is delighted by having an )
inclination for Him, and such qualities as peace, forgiveness
and politeness, are revealed in him. But if he goes astray, he

* The places, where people don't chant and listen to the Lord's names,
glories and sports which dispel fear of demons, are haunted by ogresses
(Srimadbha. 10/6/3).
"
1337,"1282 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA (Chapter11 =~
has to face adversity, which is natural. |
The man (soul), is a fragment of the Lord. But, having an
incliniation for matter, he has a desire for prosperity and pleasure.
The more, he tries to gain these, the more entangled, he gets in
disquietude, adversity and in burning sensation etc. But, when |
by having disinclination for the world, he starts moving towards
the Lord, he starts attaining bliss, and his sorrows diminish.
Appendix—Here the term ‘sthane’ should be understood
for both the preceding verses and the succeeding verses to this 7
verse. Whatever the Lord said in the thirty-second, thirty-third
and thirty-fourth verses and whatever has been said inthis verse ts”
for that Arjuna says, “O Lord! You said that the warriors of
the hostile army have already been slain and I should merely |
become an instrument— in this way whatever You said is quite
proper. The world is delighted by chanting Your names and -
glories, and the demons, being terrified, are fleeing—whatever
is happening is proper. All this human-drama is being staged |
by You, not by me.” :
ICIS
Link:— Arjuna justifies the propriety of the term 'Sthane'’,
used in the preceding verse, in the next four verses, and offers
repeated salutations to the Lord.

of all, the progenitor, even of the Brahm4? O Infinite one, O Lord

of the gods, O Abode of the universe, You are eternal. You are

the being (real), the non-being (unreal), and that, which is beyond,

both being and non-being viz., the Imperishable Brahma. 37

Comment:— ;

""Kasmacca te na nameranmahatman gariyase brahmano-
pyadikartre'—The Lord, is the progenitor not only of the
universe, but of Brahma Himself, who created it. Thus, being
the greatest and the best of all the worldly things and persons
etc. He deserves the homage of all. Homage, is paid to two ;
kinds of persons (i) Preceptors (ii) Parents, grand-parents and —
elders. The Lord, is the preceptor* and father of Brahma, the _ -
creator of the universe.

'‘Ananta'—The Lord, is infinite, because He transcends time, a
space and intellect etc. He has no beginning and no end. His -
forms and glories, are also infinite.

""DeveSa—He is the Lord of all the gods, who are known,
such as Indra, the king of the gods and Varuna, the deity of the
waters etc., as well as, those who are unknown; their destiny, ts
shaped by Him and He controls all of them. :

'Jagannivasa'—The Lord, is the Abode of the infinite universes,
because all of them are held in one of His limbs. In spite of it,
that limb is not fully occupied, it still remains vacant.

'Tvamaksaram  sadasattatpararn yat'—The Lord, is
Imperishable.T He is the real, which never ceases to be and
He is also the unreal, which has no existence, and He is also,
the Absolute, the Transcendental, Who is beyond the power of
senses, mind and intellect and cannot be described, in anyway. , :

* Sage Patajfijali has said, ""The Lord is the preceptor of even Brahma who
emanated from Him first of all"" (YogadarSana 1/26).

Tt In the first verse of the eighth chapter Arjuna asked, ""What is Brahma?""

The Lord answered, ""The Supreme Imperishable is Brahma."" Similarly Anjuna
called Him the Imperishable in (11/18) and also in this verse.
"
1339,"1284 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 11 _
| It means, that He is the best, the greatest and the most
Supreme Being. So it is proper to pay obeisance to You.
Appendix—By the expression ‘Sadasaccaham’ (9/19) and by
the expression ‘sadasattatpararh’ used here the infinitude and
entirety of the Lord endowed with attributes are proved. :
The real and the unreal are relative terms, so they are earthly
(worldly) but He Who is beyond them, having independent
existence, is unearthly (divine). Both the mundane and the
divine are the manifestations of the entire God. The higher and |
lower nature of God are not beyond the real and the unreal but -
God transcends the real and the unreal also—‘mattah paratararh =
nanyatkificidasti dhanafijaya’ (Gita 7/7). -
Within ‘saguna’ (entire form of God), ‘nirguna’ can be
included, but within ‘nirguna’, ‘saguna’ cannot be included. The
reason is that in ‘saguna’ there is no negation of ‘nirguna’, but __
in ‘nirguna’ there is negation of ‘saguna’. Therefore ‘nirguna’
is unipresent (finite) viz., within it all is not included. But
within “saguna’ (entire form) all is included, nothing is left out.
Therefore, Arjuna by the expression ‘sadasattatpararh yat’ seems sy.
to say, “You are the real, You are the unreal and You are also
the entity beyond these two, which we can imagine. From the
view-point of knowledge You are also the indescribable entity
which can be called neither real (existent) nor unreal (non-
existent)—‘na sattannasaducyate’ (Gita 13/12). It means that
there neither has been, nor is, nor will be, nor can be anyone
else besides You viz., You and only You exist.”

You are the Primeval God, the primordial spirit. You are the -

and the Supreme Abode. This universe is fully pervaded by you,
Being of infinite forms. 38
Comment:— _ |
'Tvamadidevah purusah puranah'—The Lord, is the Primal -
Deity, because He is the source of everything sentierit and =
insentient. He is called the most ancient Person, because He is -
the source of the entire creation and is eternal.
'Tvamasya visvasya param nidhanam'—He is the ultimate
resort of the universe, because the entire universe emanates -
from Him, abides in Him and merges in Him.
'Vettasi'—It is He, Who possesses real and full knowledge
of the past, the present and the future, and there is none who
can be equal to Him in knowledge. /
'Vedyam'—He is the only knowable by the scriptures and the
saints and His knowledge, is the highest goal of human life.
""Param dhama'—He, is the Supreme Abode, attaining Whom,
there is no return and nothing remains to be done, to be known,
and to be acquired. This Supreme Abode, is also called salvation
or the Supreme State etc.
‘Anantariipa'—His forms, which He revealed in His cosmic
body, are infinite.
Tvaya tatam visvam'—The entire universe, is pervaded by
Him, He permeates every particle, of the universe.
Appendix—lIn this verse Arjuna is repeating the utterances
of the Lord by the term ‘adideva’ which was expressed by the
Lord by the expression ‘ahamadirhi devanarh maharsinam ca
"
1341,"1286 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 11 ;
sarvasah’ (10/2). Though Prakrti is also beginningless—“‘prakrtimh
purusarh caiva viddhyanadi ubhavapi’ (13/19), yet prakrti depends
on God. The reason is that prakrti is the kaleidoscopic power
of God but God is not anyone’s power and He is the master
of the power. | /
‘puranah’—The Lord mentioned it by the term “‘puranam’ (8/9).
No one is more ancient than God because He is beyond time.
‘pararh nidhanam’—It was mentioned by the Lord by the
term ‘nidhanam’ (9/18). The universe is endless but it abides in |
a fragment of God. 7
‘vetta’—This was mentioned by the Lord by the expression -
‘vedaharh samatitani’ etc. (7/26).
‘vedyam’—This was mentioned by the Lord by the term |
‘vedyam’ (9/17). - -
‘param dhama’—The Lord mentioned it by the expression
‘yarh prapya na nivartante taddhama paramarh mama’ (8/21). |
‘tvaya tatarhn viSvam’—The Lord mentioned it by the
expressions “yena sarvamidam tatam’ (8/22) and ‘maya tatamidarh

Comment:—

""Namah purastadatha prsthataste namo'stu te sarvata eva -
sarva'—Being horror-struck, Arjuna is unable to think what to
say, and so he bows to the Lord, and offers Him salutations
from all quarters.

‘Anantaviryamitavikramastvam'——The Lord, possesses infinite -
prowess and might, which is beyond the conception of any
mortal. a

‘Sarvam samapnosi tato'’si sarvah'— He pervades the
entire universe, there is no atom in the universe, which is devoid
of Him. |

Arjuna, beholds that the Lord pervades infinite universes
and infinite universes, abide in one of His limbs.

Appendix—Having seen the divine cosmic form of the
Lord, Arjuna said, “You are scorching the universe with your
radiance”—‘svatejasa viSvamidarh tapantam’ (11/19), then He
who was scorching and also the universe which was being
scorched—both are the organs of the Lord’s cosmic form. Seeing
the frightening form of the Lord, the three worlds are greatly
alarmed—‘lokatrayarh pravyathitarhn mahatman’ (11/20), the world
"
1344,"Verse 40] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI - 1289 -
which is greatly alarmed is also an organ of the Lord’s cosmic

form. Having seen God, the gods being terrified, are uttering

the Lord’s glories—‘kecidbhitah prafijalayo grnanti’ (11/21) and
‘terrified demons are fleeing in all the ten directions’ —‘raksamsi

bhitani diso dravanti’ (11/36)—thus the terrified gods and demons -
are also the organs of the cosmic form of the Lord. The reason is

that these gods and demons etc., were not present in Kuruksetra,

but they were seen by Arjuna in the cosmic form of God.

Brahma, Visnu, Siva, Rudras, Adityas, Vasus, Sadhyas,
Visvedevas, Asvinikumaras, Maruts, manes, celestial serpents, .
Gandharvas, Yaksas, Asuras, great sages, Siddhas, Wind-god, ~
Yama (god of death), god of fire, god of water, the moon, the
sun etc., and besides them Bhisma, Drona, Karna, Jayadratha etc..,
all the kings are the organs of the Lord’s divine cosmic form.

Not only this but Arjuna, Safijaya, Dhrtarastra and the armies -
of Kauravas and Pandavas are also the organs of that cosmic
form—‘sarvam samapnosi tato’si sarvah.’ |

It means that whatever insentient or sentient, unmoving or
moving is being seen, heard and thought of, that is all only
imperishable God. In order to realize it, a striver should have
a firm belief that whether he understands it or not, he realizes
it or not, he accepts it or not, but this is a verity. As water-
element equally pervades, whether it is a drop of water or a big
ocean, similarly God pervades everywhere from the tiniest to
the biggest objects—by having this belief, a striver should do
Obeisance mentally every time to all persons and objects etc.
Whatever objects such as trees, rivers, mountains, stones and
walls etc., are seen, by beholding his favourite God in them he ,
should pray to them, ‘O Lord! Bestow your love upon me. I
do obeisance to You’. By doing so God will be visible to him
everywhere because in fact ‘All is God’. | -

Link:—Arjuna in the next two verses prays to the Lord to

[Having seen the terrible form, of the Lord, when Arjuna
is terror-struck, he forgets that He is Sri Krsna, and so he asks
Him Who He is. But, when he regains his memory, he comes to
know, that He is the same Lord Krsna, his friend. So he prays
"
1346,"Verse 41-42] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1291 _
to Lord Krsna, to forgive him for any of his past offence.] _

'Sakheti matva prasabham yaduktam he krsna he yadava he
sakheti ajanata mahimanam tavedam maya pramadatpranayena
vapi'—Those, who are venerable do not, called by personal names.
They are addressed as your highness, your honour, or sire or sir,
etc. Arjuna, did not pay due regard and reverence to Krsna, Who
was no Other than the Lord, Himself. He did not know Him and
His glory, in reality. So, he instead of addressing Him, as sir or |
sire etc., addressed Him in a familiar and friendly way, as ‘Krsna’
or ‘friend’, due to carelessness or love. Arjuna, knew the Lord's
real self and His glories, to some extent, because he rejecting -
the powerful Narayani army (consisting of 1,09,350 foot-soldiers, -
65,610 horses, 21,870 chariots and 21,870 elephants) and opted
for Him, Who would remain unarmed in the war. But, he did .
not know, that the Lord holds infinite universes, in one of His -
limbs and His glories, are infinite. So he realized that he was an |
ordinary mortal, while the Lord is the greatest master of even
gods, and His merits, are numberless. In fact, no one can know
the glory of the Lord, in its entirety. It is infinite. In case, it is |
known, it becomes finite. When even glories emanating from
His power, are countless, how can His own glories be finite,
and be counted and grasped?

""Yaccavahasarthamasatkrto' si vihdraSayyasanabhojanesu eko'-
thavapyacyuta tatsamaksam tatksamaye tvamahamaprameyam'—

Arjuna, realized that he by regarding the Lord as his equal and

friend, had slighted and shown disrespect to Him, the Infinite,

in jest, while playing, reposing, sitting or dining, either alone

or in company, and it was quite improper and unseemly, on his
part, to do so. So, he humbly sought His pardon, for his past
misbehaviour. | |

Arjuna and Lord Krsna were, indeed very intimate friends.

Both of them were very frank with each other, while playing,
bathing, reposing, sitting or dining etc. So, Arjuna might not have
"
1347,"1292 $RIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 11 -
behaved with decorum and poked fun at him. Arjuna addressed
the Lord as infinite, because He was beyond the limit, of even
divine eyes. :

Appendix—Arjuna regarded Lord Krsna as his friend but
having seen the Lord’s glory, he forgets the notion of friendship
with Him and he is surprized and terrified. He could never think

_ of such a grandeur of the Lord.

cannot know His infinite glories, how can he offer praises to
Him? So, he can merely bow down, and prostrate his body, at
His feet, in order to please Him. |

son, friend, or wife. , . ~
In the forty-first and forty-second verses, Arjuna explained :
that carelessness, intimacy and fun, are three factors, which |
contribute to a feeling of a slight. So, here by citing the examples
of father and son, husband and wife, friend and friend, Arjuna ~
clarifies the above three factors, respectively.
‘Eleven kinds of sentiments, in the eleventh chapter
In the eleventh chapter, there is description of eleven
sentiments. In the Lord's divine form there is a sentiment of
serenity (11/15—18), in the cosmic form there is a sentiment
of wonder, (11/20); in the fearful form, in which people are
being destroyed, there is a sentiment of wrath (11/30—32);
in the vast and terrible form having fearful teeth resembling
a raging fire, there is a sentiment of disgust (11/23—25);
when Lord Krsna asks Arjuna to arise for battle, there is a
sentiment of bravery (11/33); when Arjuna bows down and
prostrates his body, there is a sentiment of service (11/44);
when Arjuna beholds warriors, entering the Lord's mouth, |
with great rapidity for destruction, there is a sentiment of
pity (11/28-29); when Arjuna prays to Lord Krsna, to forgive
his faults, by giving illustrations of a father, a friend and
a husband, these are sentiments, of affection, friendship and
conjugal love, respectively (11/44) and when Arjuna thinks
"
1350,"Verse 45] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1295 -
of the way, in which he might have insulted Lord Krsna in
jest, there is the sentiment of humour (11/42).

Comment:— :
{When Arjuna prayed to the Lord, to reveal His cosmic form
to him He revealed it to him. So having faith in His grace, he
prays to him to reveal to him, His divine form.]
""Adrstaptrvam hrsito’'smi drstva bhayena ca pravyathitam
mano me'—When Arjuna, had a vision of the Lord's cosmic form,
his joy knew no bounds, and he considered himself very fortunate,
because the Lord by His infinite compassion, had revealed to
him that form. But, when he beheld the fearful phase, of that |
cosmic form, he trembled with fear.
""Tadeva me darsaya deva riipam prasida deveSa jagannivasa'—
The term 'Tat' (that), denotes that Arjuna in the past, had a
vision of that divine form, which is now out of sight. When
Arjuna, saw the Lord's cosmic form, he saw Brahma seated
"
1351,"1296 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 11 -
on the lotus-seat (11/15). It indicated that he also beheld Lord

Visnu, from whose navel, the divine lotus sprang. Then Arjuna,

in the seventeenth verse, said, ""I see you with a diadem, club,

discus ('Ca’ denotes conch and lotus)"". It shows, that Arjuna
had a vision of the divine form* (four-armed Lord) also, within

that cosmic form.

The term 'Deva rupam’, refers to the four-armed divine
form, which he saw within the Lord's cosmic form. Secondly,
in the fifteenth verse, Arjuna addressed the Lord as 'Deva' (God) |
(Divinity), which means that Arjuna prayed to Him, to reveal _ |
to him neither the cosmic form nor the human form, but the -
four-armed form.

‘Prasida devesa jagannivasa'—Here the term ‘Jagannivasa’, .
denotes the cosmic form, while 'DeveSsa, refers to His four- -
armed form. Arjuna by using the term ‘Jagannivasa', means to
say that His cosmic form, which is the abode of the universes,
has already been seen by him, and he is still beholding it. But
he prays to Him, to reveal to him His divine form (DeveSa) viz.,
the Lord of the gods). :

The cosmic form of the Lord, is divine, imperishable and
eternal. In this form, there are infinite universes; and Brahma,
Visnu and Siva, who create, preserve and destroy these universes,
which are also infinite. Infinite universes, emanate from this form
and again merge into it, yet, it remains, the same without any
modification. It is so unusual that the effulgence of a thousand |
suns blazing forth all at once, cannot be compared with, its
splendour (11/12). This form, can be seen only with divine eyes.
With an eye of knowledge, one perceives existence of the Lord,

* The Lord in the forty-ninth verse by the term ‘Punah' (again) and 'Tadeva’
(even that ) and Safijaya in the fiftieth verse by the term 'Bhiyah’ (again) mention
the same divine four-armed form (seen in the cosmic form).
"
1352,"Verse 46] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1297 -
Who is the origin of the universe; with an emotional eye, one
sees the universe, as manifestation of the Lord, but one cannot
have a vision of the cosmic form, of the Lord with human
eyes. As far as human eyes, are concerned, with these one can
perceive, the universe neither, as originated from the Lord, nor :
as His manifestation, nor His cosmic form, because eyes being
evolutes of matter cannot perceive, objects, beyond it.
Various forms of the Lord, whether they are two-armed,
four-armed or a million-armed, are divine and imperishable and
the same, is the case, whether He is formless, attributeless or _
with form and attributes etc. 7 :
In His sport of love, the Lord possesses only two-arms, :
but when He wants to reveal his glory, He reveals his cosmic |
form to a devotee, as He revealed to Arjuna, in a limb of his
human body. | -
The Lord, possesses infinite divine virtues, such as glory,
beauty, generosity and grace etc., and He reveals Himself with
those virtues, to His devotees in His cosmic form. The Lord,
bestows divine eyes upon His devotees, and enables them to
behold different aspects, of His form, according to their tastes :
and eligibility. In the eleventh chapter, also the Lord revealed,
first His gentle divine form (11/15—18), then, the fearful form
(11/19—22) and then the most ternble form (11/23—30). When
Arjuna, was terrified by having a vision of His most fearful form,
the Lord, ceased revealing other aspects of His cosmic form. It
means, that the Lord revealed to Arjuna, aspects of His cosmic
form, according to his need and eligibility.

I wish to see You as befere, crowned, holding a mace and a

Comment:— :

'Kiritinam gadinam cakrahastamicchami tvam drastumaharm
tathaiva'—Arjuna, desired to see the Lord crowned, holding a So
mace and a discus 1.e., the Lord's four-armed divine form. _

By using the term 'Tathaiva', Arjuna means to say, that when
he expressed his wish to see His cosmic form, He revealed that
form to him (11/3). So, now he wants to-see His four-armed _
divine form only which he saw in His cosmic form.

""Tenaiva ripena caturbhujena sahasrabaho bhava viSvamirte'—

The term 'Eva’ (only), has been used, for the negation of cosmic ;
form, mentioned in the fifteenth and the seventeenth verses, the
expression ""Tena caturbhujena rupena’, for the four-armed form -
and the term 'Bhava' for 'be' or ‘appear’. In the previous verse,

the term, ""Tadeva’, and in this verse, the terms ‘Tathaiva’ and
‘Tenaiva', indicate that Arjuna was very much terrified, of the
cosmic form and so he uttered the term 'Eva' (only),three times 7
to express his desire to have a vision of His four-armed form

only. Arjuna, did not want to see the four-armed form, in the

cosmic form.

* The terms ‘Idam’ denotes nearness, ‘Etat’ denotes much nearness, ‘Adas' -
denotes distance and ‘Tat’ denotes invisibility (out of sight). For the Lord's
cosmic form the term ‘dam’ has been used in the eighteenth and the nineteenth
verses for Bhisma and Drona etc., who were very near, the term ‘Etat’ has been
used in the thirty-third verse for the gods etc., seen in the cosmic body at a far
distance, the term 'Adas' has been used in the twenty-first, twenty-sixth and twenty-
eighth verses and for the four-armed form of Lord Visnu seen in the first phase of
the cosmic form (being out of sight at that time) the term ‘Tat’ has been used.
"
1354,"Verse 47] -SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1299 -
Arjuna addresses the Lord as ‘Sahasrabaho' (a thousand-
armed), to pray Him to withdraw that cosmic form, and become
only four-armed, while the vocative ""Visvamurte' (Universal Form),
indicates that Arjuna wanted the Lord to withdraw His cosmic
form, and become a four-armed Visnu. -
-. Appendix—Though in this verse there is mention of a mace
and a discus which the Lord holds but because here it has been
mentioned that He is four-armed, so in the other two arms, he
_ 1s holding a conch and a lotus—it should be understood.

The Blessed Lord said:
Arjuna, being pleased with you, I have shown you through My

1355,"1300 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 11 .
power of Yoga, this supreme, shining primal and infinite Universal
Form, which none but you, has ever seen. 47 |
Comment:—
‘Maya prasannena tavarjunedar rijparn darsitam'— O Arjuna! .
You are time and again, saying ""Be kind to me” (11/25, 31, 45).
But I have neither revealed to you this terrible cosmic form out
of anger, to frighten you nor because of your qualifications,
deserving nature, or devotion. It was because of your desire to
behold My universal form, that I by My grace bestowed upon
you divine eyes to have a vision of this form. It means, that Se
it was only out of compassion, that being pleased with you, I -
enabled you to behold My cosmic form. Your desire was merely
an instrument.
At the end of the tenth chapter in the forty-first verse, I told
you wherever any excellence is seen, that is My glory. Thus, I
completed My reply to your question. In the last verse of the
tenth chapter, of my own initiative I told you, ""You need not -
know much, whatever is seen or heard or grasped in the world,
that comes from within a fragment of My body."" Further, I told .
you, ""You need not know My glories and divine power, when
the base of all glories and divine power, I Myself am standirg
before you."" I told you all these things, out of My special divine
grace. Then you expressed your desire, to behold the cosmic |
form and I revealed it to you, by blessing you with divine eyes.
This is out of My pleasure and grace only. Therefore you need
not fear at all.
'‘Atmayogat'—I have revealed to you this universal form,
through My own power of Yoga.
‘Param'—This cosmic form is supreme.
'Tejomayam'—This form is_ glittering and _ effulgent.
So, you said that it was hard to look at, even with divine
eyes (11/17).
'Visvam'—This universal form of Mine is all-pervading and
"
1356,"Verse 47] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1301
you yourself have addressed Me as 'Vigvaripa’ and ‘Visvamurte'
(Universal Form).
‘Anantamadyam'—This universal form of Mine, is without =
beginning and an end, because it is primal and without cause.
'Yanme tvadanyena na drstapirvam'—None, besides you
has ever seen this universal form. Now a question arises why, .
the Lord has made this remark, when this form was revealed to |
Rama's mother, Kausalya, Krsna's mother Yasoda and also Bhisma,
Drona, Safjaya, Vidura etc., in the court of the Kauravas, by
Him. The answer is, that the cosmic form revealed to Arjuna was oe
very frightening and many valiant warriors and commanders etc., -
were entering the Lord's blazing mouths headlong and therefore it
was quite different from, what the Lord had revealed to Kausalya,
Yasoda and also, in the court of the Kauravas. _
Secondly, on the battlefield it was inevitable to reveal such
a fearful cosmic form, to the warrior, Arjuna, while there was
no need to reveal such a form to Yasoda and Kauéaly etc., nor Te
were they capable, of beholding that form.
The Lord declared, that none, besides him had ever seen -
His universal form, but He did not say that none besides Arjuna,
was beholding that form at that time, because Sanjaya was also
beholding that form. Therefore he declares, ""Recalling that :
wondrous cosmic form of Lord Krsna, great is my wonder and ——
I rejoice again and again"" (18/77).
.
Lord Krsna declared, ""O Arjuna, being pleased with you, I
have shown you this universal form."" It shows that the Lord is
much more gracious, than a striver regards Him to be. His grace
is infinite, while a man's power to admit His grace is limited.
Generally a striver, in favourable circumstances thinks that
the Lord is gracious to him, and he becomes pleased. But the
fact is, that the Lord showers His grace equally on a striver, in
"
1357,"1302 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 11
favourable, as well as unfavourable circumstances. So, one should
perceive His grace, in all the circumstances and should, neither
limit it to favourable circumstances, nor enjoy it. _
: Attachment to happiness, also binds a striver (Gita 14/6), .
because it is an obstacle to attainment of the state, which
transcends the three Gunas (modes of nature). So a striver, |
should not enjoy happiness, which is derived out of spiritual |
discipline. He should rather remain engaged, in the discipline
scrupulously. By doing so, in the course of time, he will have
disinclination for that happiness. But, if a striver cautiously oe
remains detached from that happiness, he can attain the Supreme -
Bliss instantly. |

Arjuna, in this mortal world, I could not be seen in this form,
by anyone, other than you, either through the study of the Vedas,
or of rituals, or by gifts, sacrifices or austere penances. 48
Comment:— |
'Kurupravira'—The Lord, addresses Arjuna as 'Kurupravira’
(great hero of the Kurus), because among all the Kurus, he was
the noblest, as it was only he, who was curious to listen to the
gospel of the Gita, to have a vision of His cosmic form and to
"
1358,"Verse 48] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1303
know Him, in reality. One who wants to see Him, and to know
Him is noble. |

""Na vedayajnadhyayanairna danairna ca_ kriyabhirna ~
tapobhirugraih'—The study of the Vedas, the performance of
sacrifice with due ceremony, enjoined by the scriptures, offering
charity, observing fasts, undergoing severe bodily and mental |
suffering as austere penances, etc., cannot enable a man, to behold .
the Lord's cosmic form, because all of these have a beginning
and an end. Thus, their fruit is also perishable. How then, can
they enable a man, to behold the Lord's cosmic form, which is oo .
infinite, imperishable, eternal and divine? The eternal form can be -
beheld, only by His grace, because His grace is also eternal.

In the Gita there is a general description of sacrifice, charity
and penance. In the twenty-eighth verse of the eighth chapter and — -
in the fifty-third verse of this chapter, there is description of the
study of the Vedas, performance of sacrifice, offering charities
and undergoing penance. In addition, to these four, in this verse, - oe
there is description of actions also. In the twenty-eighth verse
of the eighth chapter, there is the use of seventh inflexion and .
plural number, in other cases, generally there is the use of first
inflexion and plural number, while in this verse, there is use of
third inflexion and plural number, which means, that the practice 7
of each of the above-mentioned methods or even all the means OO
together made time and again cannot be conducive, to the vision
of the Lord's cosmic form. The reason is, that the vision of His
cosmic form, is not the fruit of any action.

As by these meritorious deeds, a man cannot be qualified 7
to have a vision of the Lord's cosmic form, similarly His four-
armed form, cannot seen by these means, (11/53), it can be seen
only by exclusive devotion (11/54). Even the gods, are always
eager to behold it. But there is a difference between the two
forms. By having a vision of the four-armed form, a devotee
can develop love and devotion for the Lord, but by beholding
"
1359,"1304 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 11

the cosmic form he is scared and so he cannot develop love

and devotion. Therefore, the four-armed form, can be seen by

unswerving devotion, while the cosmic form can be beheld only _

by His grace. _

‘Evamripah sakya aharm nrioke drastum tvadanyena'— It

- does not mean, that Arjuna could view the cosmic form of the .

Lord, by any means, such as study of the Vedas or by rituals

or by gifts, sacrifice or austere penance.: But it menas, that this

form can be seen, only by His grace.
Saiijaya, had also a vision of the Lord's cosmic form, but that To ener ene nn

was possible by divine vision, offered to him by sage Vyasa's :

grace. It means, that the grace of the Lord, saints and devotees,

is more significant than the meritorious acts, of strivers. They

shower their grace, on all of us without any motive. -
Some people, have a misconception that the Lord did not

reveal, His cosmic form to Arjuna, but He only told him that Se

infinite universes, vast in a limb of His cosmic body. But actually

it is not so. The Lord, Himself asked Arjuna, ""Behold within

this cosmic body of Mine, the entire creation"" (11/7). When .

Arjuna in spite of his best efforts, could not behold it, Lord

Krsna said to him, ""You cannot see Me, with these gross eyes

of yours; therefore I vouchsafe to you divine eyes"" (11/8). Then :

the Lord, by bestowing upon Arjuna divine eyes, revealed to him OO

His cosmic form. Safijaya also said, ""Arjuna saw in the body of

that Supreme Deity, held in one limb, the whole universe with

its manifold divisions” (11/13). Arjuna also having a vision of

the Lord's cosmic form, said, ""I behold, in Your body all the

gods and multitudes of different beings, Brahma perched on

his lotus-seat, Siva, all the sages and celestial serpents” (11/15).

Thus, we see that Lord Krsna, by granting divine eyes, revealed

to Arjuna His cosmic form. It was not by the eye of wisdom,

that Arjuna perceived Him (Gita 13/34;15/11), it was only by

divine eyes, that he beheld Him. The reason is, that by aneye
"
1360,"Verse 49] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1305
of wisdom, one can distinguish the real from the unreal, but it
is only by the divine eye that one could behold Him.

Comment:— | |
'Ma te vyatha ma ca vimidhabhavo drstva ripam —
ghoramidrnmamedam'— Lord Krsna, says to Arjuna that seeing
His dreadful form, with mouths terrible with teeth, in which the ——___——
~ chief warriors are rushing headlong, and some are seen sticking
in the gaps between the teeth, with their heads crushed, and He,
devouring all the worlds with His flaming mouths, licking them
on al] sides, he should neither be afraid nor bewildered, and he |
should rather be pleased. It means, that it was proper on his
part to feel delighted, as he had felt (11/45) by thinking of the
grace, instead of being bewildered. : :
Arjuna had said“'] am terror-struck’ (11/23) and ‘I am terrified
at heart’ (11/24). So in response to Arjuna’s feeling of terror,
Lord Krsna says, ""Don't be terrified."" :
"
1361,"1306 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 11
_ The Lord, revealed to him His cosmic form by being kind to
‘him, so he should not be bewildered. Secondly, He was already
pleased with him, so his request to seek His pleasure, was nothing -
else besides delusion; he should renounce this delusion. Thirdly,
he said that his delusion had disappeared (11/1) but actually it
had not disappeared. So he should renounce his delusion, and |
being fearless and pleased, should behold His divine form. As,
there was no change* in Him, in all the circumstances, while
driving his horses, or talking or revealing the cosmic form,
he should also, not undergo any change, after beholding His ee
cosmic form.
The Lord, further said to Arjuna that he was terrified and
bewildered, because of his egoism, and mineness. It was sheer
foolishness. So, he should be free from this foolishness. It is _
because of these wicked traits, a man wants to maintain perishable |
things and persons etc. But those having a spiritual inclination,
behold the Lord pervading everywhere and so become fearless. To ee
Beholding the Nrsirhha (head of a lion and the body of a man)
incarnation of the Lord, when even gods were terrified, Prahlada,
was not afraid because he beheld Him, pervading everywhere. .
So he fell at His feet and He took him to His lap, and began
to lick him. :
""Vyapetabhih pritamanah punastvam tadeva me ripamidam ee
prapasya'—Arjuna, in the forty-fifth verse said, ""My mind is
confused by fear."" So the Lord says to him, ""Be fearless and
have a complacent mind.”
The Lord uses the term 'Punah' (again), asking Arjuna to |
behold again, the same four-armed form, which he had seen
in His cosmic body, and by the term ‘Tadeva' and ‘Idam’ Lord
indicates as you do not want to see this form alongwith the
* Though Arjuna finds change in him yet he thinks that the Lord is
uniform and never undergoes any change. So he addresses Him as 'Acyuta’' in the
beginning, the middle and the end (Gita 1/21, 11/42 and 18/73).
"
1362,"Verse 49] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1307

Brahma, Siva and frightful cosmic form therefore I manifest

Myself:in that four-armed form only and he should behold, that

very form, very carefully. -
How long did Saiijaya and Arjuna have that divine vision? — |

Safijaya was offered divine vision* by sage Vyasa, when
the war was going to be waged so that he could communicate
the details of the war to Dhrtarastra. But, when at the death of
Duryodhana, Sanjaya was overwhelmed with grief, he lost his
divine vision. T | a, |

When Arjuna requested Lord Krsna, to reveal to him, His* - So
cosmic form, He bestowed upon him divine eyes (11/8) and Anjuna :
had a vision of His divine form and fearful form in His cosmic
body. But beholding His malevolent form, Arjuna was terrified
and offering his praises to Him, he said that he was affected by _
fear and so prayed to Him, to reveal to him his four-armed form.

Then, He revealed to him first, His four-armed form and then

the two-armed, human form. It proves, that Arjuna possessed — .
divine vision upto the forty-ninth verse, because Arjuna in the

fifty-first verse, says to Lord Krsna, ""Seeing this gentle human

form of Yours, O Janardana, I am now composed, and restored :

to my usual nature.

Now a doubt arises as to why Arjuna did not lose the |
faculty of divine vision, when he had been frightened and terrified —
(11/23-24). The clarification is, that by then Arjuna, was not too
frightened to lose his divine vision. But, he is much frightened
now and so being terrified, he bows to the Lord again and
again, and prays to Him to reveal to him the divine form, with

* O king! Sajijaya will relate to you the details of the war. Everything of
the battlefield will be visible to him. Safijaya endowed with divine vision
will become omniscient and will tell you the incident of the war (Maha.

Bhisma. 2/9-10).

f O sinless king! I am overwhelmed with grief at your son's departure
to the heavenly abode and I have lost my divine vision bestowed upon me by
sage Vyasa (Maha. Sauptika. 9/62) .
"
1363,"1308 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 11
four-arms (11/45). It 1s here, that he loses divine vision.

Secondly, Arjuna had a keen desire to see His cosmic form
(11/3). So Lord Krsna vouchsafed divine vision to Arjuna but _
here he had no longing to behold His cosmic form, but being |
terrified, he longs to see His divine form, so there is no need
of the divine eye. Thus, he loses divine vision.

If Sanjaya and Arjuna, had not been overwhelmed with grief |
and fear, they would have continued to possess the divine vision
and seen more details. But, it was because of their grief and terror,
that they lost their divine vision. Similarly, when a man out of ee
delusion is attached to the world, he loses discrimination. As a -
greedy man, by losing discrimination commits deadly sins, such
as thefts, robberies and even murders, but if he without being
deluded, attaches due importance to discrimination, he himself .
will attain salvation, and will lead the world to salvation.

Appendix—Arjuna being non-plussed, humbly sought
the Lord’s pardon for his past misbehaviour—‘tatksamaye ee
tvamahamaprameyam’ (11/42), so here the Lord says, “I may
appear either in My serene form or frightening form, after all -
I am your friend. You were terrified, it was your delusion, it |
was a lack in friendship. All that is seen is My pastime. What
is there to be terrified? In friendship, who is the high and who |
is the low.” . _ —________

God has revealed Himself in the form of the universe,
therefore this universe is said to be the first incarnation at
the beginning of the creation—‘adyo’vatarah purusah parasya’
(Stimadbha. 2/6/41). As God has incarnated Himself as Rama |
and Krsna, so has He incarnated Himself as the universe. It has
been called incarnation because in it God 1s objectively seen.

At the time of incarnation though He seems to be worldly, yet
He remains unworldly (divine) (Gita 4/6). But He seems to be
earthly to the ignorant people because of their own attachment
and aversion (Gita 7/24-25, 9/11). |
"
1364,"Verse 49] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1309

It is God’s will whether He reveals Himself in serene form
or terrific form. If the scene is beautiful, where flowers are
blooming and the atmosphere is full of fragrance, that is also -
the manifestation of God; and on the other hand if there is the
scene where flesh, bones and waste matter are lying and that
garbage is giving out stench—that is also the manifestation of
God. There is nothing else besides God. God revealed Himself
as Rama and Krsna and He also revealed Himself as a fish, a
tortoise and a wild boar. He may assume any form but He is
certainly God. Whatever person or object is seen, that is the form .
of God and whatever action takes place, that is His pastime. If re
any person commits a sin or does injustice to other, it means that 7
He is staging the human drama of Kali age. He plays according
to the semblance he assumes.* If He assumes the form of an
idol (arcavatara), He like an idol, acts by remaining immovable. -
It is not befitting for Him to perform an action as an idol but it
is proper for Him not to perform any action, otherwise how will
He remain an incarnation in the form of an idol? While assuming Oe
the form of a wild boar, He acts like a wild boar and when He
incarnates as a man, He acts (behaves) like a mant. He may -
assume any form and may act accordingly but it does not affect
devotees’ hearts because they hold that there neither is, nor was,
nor will be nor can be any other entity besides God. -

The universe which we (the worldly people) see is not the CC
cosmic form of God because the cosmic form is divine and
imperishable while the universe which we see is material and
perishable. As we see the material Vrndavana but within it don’t
see the divine Vmdavana, similarly we see the material (physical)
universe, but within it the divine universe (cosmic form) is not
seen to us. It’s reason is the desire for pleasure. It is because of
this desire for pleasure that inertness, materialism and impurity

1365,"1310 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA (Chapter 11
have prevailed in the universe. It is because of the desire for
pleasure that there is attraction for the world. If this attraction is
wiped out, then the whole world is divine cosmic form only. -
On Self-realization the universe appears divine to a Jnani, |
but it seems sweet (loving) to a devout devotee. Having seen it
in the form of ‘madhurya’ (sweet), as a man naturally loves his
body, so does a devotee naturally loves all beings. But Arjuna
saw the Lord’s divine (glorious) cosmic form because he wanted _
to see the same form—‘drastumicchami te rtpamaisvararh
purusottama’ (11/3). In ‘madhurya’ there is special lovingness Se
and in ‘aisvarya’ (glory) there is special influence. It means that .
the divine cosmic form in spite of being one, appears in numerous
forms, according to the sentiment of a devotee and in spite of
appearing in numerous forms, it remains one. Diversity is unity -
and unity is diversity is the Lord’s singularity, unworldliness
(divinity) and peculiarity. :

Sanjaya said:

Having spoken thus to Arjuna, Lord Vasudeva, showed again |
His usual four-armed form and assumed the two-armed gentle _
appearance, thus the great soul gave solace to Arjuna, who was -
frightened. 50
Comment:—

‘Ityarjunam vasudevastathoktva svakam riiparn darsayamasa
bhiiyah'— The expression ‘Ityarjunarh vasudevastathoktva’, denotes
that, when Arjuna prayed to Lord Krsna to reveal to him, His
four-armed divine form, He asked him not to be terrified of ee
His cosmic form, and behold His divine form, with a .
complacent mind.

The term ‘tatha’ means, as the Lord only out of grace revealed
to Arjuna His cosmic form, so did He reveal His four-armed
divine form, to him, this vision was not due to possession of
extraordinary spiritual qualifications by Arjuna but due to divine
grace only. To nce

By the term 'Bhuyah’ Sanjaya means to say that the Lord
revealed to Arjuna the same divine form which he had beheld :
within the cosmic body of the Lord (11/15,17) and for which |
he prayed to Him (11/45-46).

'‘ASvasayamasa ca bhitamenam § bhitva = punah
saumyavapurmahatma'—Lord Krsna revealed to Arjuna his —_—————
four-armed form and then He assumed two-armed human form |
in order to console Arjuna who was frightened.

Now a question arises whether the Lord was four-armed
or two-armed. The answer is that He remained two-armed for .
carrying on His human sport, but revealed His four-armed form
sometimes, when He thought it proper.

In the tenth chapter, the Lord described his divine glories
and in the eleventh chapter He has revealed, His cosmic form.

Thus a devotee comes to know His usual power and influence.
If a person, knows Him in reality, or has faith in Him, he may |
"
1367,"1312 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 11
be freed, from the bondage of birth and death, forever.
- How gracious the Lord was to Arjuna, that first He revealed
His cosmic form, then divine form, and finally assumed Histwo- =~
armed form! Moreover, He has also showered His grace on all of
us, that we should think of the Lord, whenever and wherever,
our mind is attracted towards any person, object or glory or merit
etc. All of us, have got the same golden opportunity of listening
to His divine glories, and thinking of and recollecting His cosmic
form, which was available to a few persons, such as Arjuna and
Safijaya. So we should not miss such an opportunity. oe

Comment:— : |
'‘Drstvedam manusam ripam tava saumyam janardana
- idanimasmi samvrttah sacetah prakrtim gatah'—Arjuna says to
Lord Krsna, that having seen His human form, which He assumes
as a sport, even cows, beasts, birds, trees and creepers etc., are
thrilled, with delight (Srimadbha. 10/29/40). Having beheld that
human form, he is also composed and is his normal self again.
"
1368,"Verse 51] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1313
The terror which was caused by beholding the Lord's cosmic
form, has disappeared altogether. By the term 'Sacetah', Arjuna
means to say, that when he diverted his attention towards the _
Lord's grace, he realised that he was a pigmy before the wonderful
cosmic form, of the Lord and it was only out of grace, that He
revealed to him His cosmic form, divine form and finally assumed
the human form though he did not deserve it. :
Appendix—Arjuna has called the Lord’s form as human
because it was gentle two-armed form. Lord Krsna was two-
armed. In Brahmavaivartapurana it is mentioned— _ a
tvameva bhagavanadyo nirgunah prakrteh parah, :
arddhango dvibhujah krsno’pyarddhangena caturbhujah.
(Prakrti. 12/15)
“You, O God, are the origin of all, You are attributeless, -
You transcend prakrti, You have revealed Yourself as two-armed
Krsna, with half part; and with the other half part, You have
revealed Yourself as four-armed Visnu.’ | - a

‘Two-armed Krsna is Radhika’s husband and four-armed Visnu SO
is Laksmi’s husband. Krsna surrounded by Gopas (cowherds)
and Gopikas (cowherd women) live in Goloka, and Visnu with
Laksmi (as well as His councillors) reside in Vaikuntha. Both
of them (Krsna and Visnu) are the same in everyway viz., both :
are one only.’ |
It means that two-armed Krsna, four-armed Visnu and the
Lord with thousands of arms (cosmic form)—all the three are
the manifestations of the entire-God (God in full).

The Blessed Lord said:
It is exceedingly difficult to observe this form of Mine which
you have seen. Even, the gods are always, keen to behold it. 52 ~
Comment:—
'‘Sudurdarsamidam ripar drstavanasi yanmama'—Here, the  -— -----—~~
form of the Lord which has been delineated is the four-armed
one, because even the gods cannot think of the cosmic form; .
and as far as the human form, is concerned, how can it be
difficult for the gods to see it, when even a man can behold it?
So here reference is to His four-armed divine form, which has _
already been mentioned as ‘divine form’ (11/45) and 'His own = ——__
form’ (11/50). |
‘Deva apyasya riipasya nityarh darsanakanksinah'—The Lord,
has declared here, that it is exceedingly difficult to see His four-
armed divine form. In the fifty-third and fifty-fourth verses,
He says that neither by the study of Vedas, nor by penance,
by charity, nor by ritual can, He be seen, in this form. Then,
He declares that He can be seen in this form, by unswerving
devotion. Now a doubt arises, why the gods cannot see Him,
when they are always eager to behold Him. The answer is that
their eagerness does not involve, exclusive devotion. Their aim
"
1370,"Verse 52] : SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1315
is to enjoy heavenly pleasure which they hanker after. Their
eagerness, is just like worldly human beings, who want to behold
the Lord, while hankering after worldly pleasure and prosperity. -
If a traveller while travelling, finds a jewel, and gets lost in,
it without reaching the destination, the gods attach secondary
importance to salvation, and so they cannot behold the Lord,
as they are too much entangled in pleasure.
The gods cannot behold the Lord, by having eagerness,
because they are proud of the high status of their divine abode, |
bodies and pleasures etc. Therefore, Arjuna, in the fourteenth vee mentee
verse of the tenth chapter, said, ""O Lord, neither the gods nor ”
demons know Your manifestation."" Thus Arjuna, has taken both
of them as belonging to the same category. It means, that as the
gods possess prosperity, the demons possess magical power. -
But, prosperity or power is not conducive, to the Lord's vision.
He, can be seen by exclusive devotion (11/54), both by the gods - oe
and human beings. |
By the expression ‘Deva api, the Lord means to say, that
virtuous actions can lead to higher regions, rather than to God- :
realization.
Appendix—Though the bodies of gods are heavenly, yet
God’s body is more singular (more divine) than gods’ bodies. oo
The bodies of gods are material, effulgent while God’s body is
divine. God’s body is truth-knowledge-bliss solidified, eternal,
unearthly and very divine.* Therefore even gods are always
been to behold God. As common people are fond of visiting
new places, so are gods fond of beholding God but they have |
no love (devotion) for Him. It means that as devotees want to
behold God by unswerving devotion, the gods don’t want to
behold Him in this way. Therefore God is subservient to His

Neither by the study of Vedas, nor by penance, nor charity, —

Comment:—

_'Drstavanasi mam yatha'—The Lord, says to Arjuna, that
he has seen His four-armed divine form, only by His grace. He
seeks to convey that a devotee, can have His vision, only by
His grace, not by any other qualification. |
_ ‘Nahar vedairna tapasa na danena na cejyaya Sakyaevarnvidho
drastum'—A man can buy an article for a hundred rupees, only
if its cost to the shopkeeper is less than a hundred mupees.
Similarly, if the Lord can be bought by means of Vedas, or __
penance or charity or ritual, it means that He is cheaper than these = 9—____
meritorious deeds. But, actually it is not so, all these meritorious
acts, cannot equal the Lord, in cost. He is far superior, to all
merit and deed. How can, He be bought by a human being,
or an object resting in a negligible fragment of the universe,
created by Him? He can be attained, only by His grace. The |
Lord showers His grace, on a person, when he, renouncing his
pride of his possessions and resources, surrenders himself to
Him. In that case, the Lord reveals Himself immediately. Till
a man attaches importance to material things, ability, power and
understanding etc., and relies upon these, the Lord remains, afar
"
1372,"Verse 54] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1317
in spite of, being the nearest.

Here, the vision of the Lord's four-armed form, rather than
the cosmic form, has been declared as rare, because the cosmic :
form has already been glorified in almost identical words, in the
forty-eighth verse. If we take it as praise of the cosmic form, it
means that we expose the Lord to a charge of repetition. Also
in the next verse the Lord Himself explains, that He can be |
seen in this form by exclusive devotion. The cosmic form cannot
be viewed by exclusive devotion, because how can a devotee |
have exclusive devotion, for His cosmic form, when even the an
valiant devotee Arjuna, was terrified of that form, while having :
divine vision?

By unswerving devotion only can I be seen in this form (with
four-arms) and known in its essence and even its merger, O
scorcher of foes. 54.
Comment:— |

'Bhaktya tvananyaya Sakya ahamevamvidho'rjuna'—Here, the |
term ‘Tu’ (indeed), has been used, to emphasize. the point that
the four-armed form, holding a conch, a disc, a mace and a lotus
each in one of the hands, cannot be seen by any meritorious
deeds, but only by exclusive devotion.

Exclusive devotion means, dependence on God only, without |
"
1373,"1318 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 11
having the least dependence on one's own ability, power, intellect
or resources etc. This exclusive devotion, is not determined either
by the mind or intellect or senses etc., but by one’s own self. —
Restlessness for a vision of the Lord, is specially contributory
to the attainment of divine vision. One cannot feel at ease,
without His vision, even for a moment. One should become
restless, for beholding the Lord. That restlessness for the Lord, |
burns the sins of infinite births. For such devotees, who have an
exclusive devotion, for the Lord, He declares, ""He who always
and constantly thinks of Me with exclusive devotion, to that — +
Yogi always absorbed in Me, I am easily attainable” (Gita 8/14); 7
and ""To those, who worship Me alone, thinking of none else,
who are ever devout, I provide, gain and security"" (Gita 9/22).
Exclusive devotion also means, no dependence on adoration -
or meditation or spiritual discipline, for God-realization. Then
why to worship the Lord and meditate on Him? These are the So
means, to do away one's pride. When pride is destroyed, the
Lord's grace, manifests itself and it is by His grace, that a
devotee attains Him. ;
'‘Jnatum drasturh ca tattvena pravestum'—The Lord, can be
known, seen and attained, by exclusive devotion.
The Lord, can also be known in reality, and attained through ——________-
knowledge (wisdom) (Gita 18/55) but He cannot be forced to
reveal Himself, to such a devotee.
‘Jnatum' (to be known), means, that a devotee knows the
Lord in reality, that all is God (Gita 7/19) and He 1s, being and |
non-being, both (Gita 9/19). It does not mean, that the Lord is
encompassed by the devotee's intellect, but He penetrates his
intellect fully.
‘Drastum' means, that a devotee can behold the Lord in any
form, such as Lord Visnu, Lord Rama or Lord Krsna.
‘Pravestum’ means, that a devotee realizes his identity,
"
1374,"Verse 54] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1319
with the Lord or he enters the sport of the Lord. To enjoy His
sport the desire of the devotee, and the will of the Lord, are
the chief factors. -

In that case, though all his desires are destroyed, yet the Lord
fulfils, not only his spiritual desire, but also mundane desire, if
any. Before beholding the Lord, Dhruva and Vibhisana, both had
a desire to rule over the kingdoms. Their worldly desires, were
satisfied by the Lord. It means that the Lord, first satisfies the
desire of a devotee, and then by His own sweet will enables, him
to attain perfection. In that case, nothing remains to be known, oe
to be done and to be acquired by him. -

The keen desire of a devotee for God-realization, rouses
the desire, in the Lord to meet His devotee. None can create,
any hurdle in the Lord's desire, to meet His devotee. Then, He
removes all obstacles of a devotee, by His grace and reveals Se
Himself to him, without consideration of his eligibility.

Appendix—Where the Lord has mentioned the Supreme -
State of Knowledge (Jnana), there by knowledge, a striver |
knows Him in essence (tattva) and merges unto Him—thus
there are two attainments; but here by devotion a striver |
knows him in essence, sees Him and merges into Him—there are oo
three attainments. By devotion God can also be seen—this is the
special feature of devotion, while having attained even the Supreme
State of Knowledge, God is not seen. Therefore there is special
glory of devotion. By devotion God in His entire form is attained.

In the attainment of Brahma (the Absolute)—‘knowing’ and |
‘entering’—there are two attainments but in the attainment of
‘Samagra’ (entire God) ‘knowing’, ‘entering’ and ‘seeing’—there
are three attainments. The reason is that in the finite, there 1s
finitude and in the entire there is entirety.

O Pandava (Arjuna), he who acts for My sake, depends on
Me, is devoted to Me, has no attachment and is free from malice,
towards all beings, reaches Me. 55
Comment:—

[The five points mentioned in this verse, can be divided into —
two parts (1) Attachment to the Lord (it) Detachment from the :
world. The first part includes, the first three points 'works for
Me’, ‘depends on Me' and is ‘devoted to Me’, while the second
part, includes the last two points—‘no attachment’ and 'freedom -
from malice’.] |

'Matkarmakrt’'—It means, that all the spiritual pursuits, such So
as utterance of the Lord's name, loud chanting, meditation, good
company and study of the sacred books, as well as, performing
mundane duties, according to one's caste, creed and stage (order)
of life, should be performed, for the Lord's sake.

Actually, the division of actions into spiritual ones and
mundane ones, is external. All the actions, whether spiritual or ee
mundane, should be performed for the Lord's sake, only because
the body, senses, mind and intellect etc., with which one performs
actions, have been given to him by God, and they are His. So he
should perform actions, with the power given by Him, according
to His ordinance, in order to please Him, by becoming merely
an instrument in His hands.

""Matparamah'— 'Matparamah’, is he who regarding the Lord
as the Supreme, depends, only on Him.

""Madbhaktah'— He is devoted to the Lord 1.e., he has admitted
his relationship with the Lord, that only He is his and he only |
"
1376,"- Verse 55] _ SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1321
is His. This relationship, develops devotion for Him.

Such a devotee, beholds the Lord pervading everywhere, all
the time in all persons, things and his own self. From the angle, -
that God is everywhere, He is also here. Being at all times, He
is now. Pervading all beings and things, He is also in him. As
He belongs to all, He is also his. He, who has such a belief, is .
the Lord's devotee. |

'Sangavarjitah nirvairah sarvabhitesu yah'—The devotee,
who works for the Lord's sake, depends on Him and is devoted |
to Him, he becomes free from attachment and desires. To en ee

Further, when a devotee realizes, that he is a fragment of the :
Lord, his devotion for Him is aroused, and then he becomes free
from attachment. Having detachment and conviction, that God
pervades all beings, he becomes free, from malice towards all -
of them, even on his receiving the worst treatment. He beholds
the Lord's will and grace, in every dealing. Thus, his affinity So
with the world, is renounced and he attains God.

‘Sa mameti'—This expression, includes the three points—to .
know Him in reality, to behold Him, and to attain Him; as |
explained in the preceding verse. It means, that he attains the
object of human life, by reaching Him.

The Lord, at the end of the ninth chapter, said to Arjuna,

""Fix your mind on Me, be devoted to Me, adore Me, bow :
down to Me, thus making yourself steadfast in Me, and entirely
depending on Me, you will come to Me"" (9/34). .

After disclosing this secret, Lord Krsna, wanted to reveal
more secrets to his devotee Arjuna and so He revealed these,
in the tenth and the eleventh chapters.

If man, depends on the perishable and kaleidoscopic,
matter (prakrti) and its evolutes, the body and the world, he has .
"
1377,"1322 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 11 .
disinclination, for the imperishable and eternal Lord. The tenth
and the eleventh chapters aim, at removing this disinclination
and conducing one towards the Lord. -

A man possesses two kinds of power—of thinking, and of
beholding. Both of these are to be utilized for devotion to God.

So Lord Krsna, preached, in the tenth chapter, that whatever ,
speciality or merit or glory a person perceives, in a thing or a © |
being, and when a thought comes to his mind, he should think

of the Lord, only. : |

In the eleventh chapter, He, by revealing His cosmic form OO
to Arjuna, means to preach that a devotee should behold Him «=»
pervading everywhere, in different forms and names etc., because
this entire universe is a part of His cosmic form.

Arjuna, prayed to Lord Krsna, two times. In _ the
seventeenth verse of the tenth chapter, he asked, “In what
various aspects are you to be thought of, by me?"" So, the Lord Fon nee ne
mentioned ‘His divine glories, that he could think of Him, in
those glories. .

At the beginning of the eleventh chapter Arjuna, said, ""I
want to see Your divine form."" So the Lord revealed to Arjuna,

His cosmic form by offering him divine vision. _ |

It means, that a striver should think only of the Lord, and | TO

' should behold everyone and everything, as the manifestation of
the Lord, only. ,

Appendix—The nature of the devotion, by which the
four-armed God can be beheld, is that a striver having
renounced attachment to the world should totally depend on
‘God. The expression ‘matkarmakrt’ means dependence on
God with the gross (physical) body; ‘matparamah’ means—
dependance on God with the subtle and the causal bodies and
‘madbhaktah’ means dependence of the self on God, because
‘IT am God’s and God is mine’—this acceptance is through |
"
1378,"Verse 55] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1323 ;
the self itself. ‘Sa mameti’—this expression means attainment
of the entire form of God.

Having heard the above description, Arjuna had a curiosity
to know, which of the devotees—of those who worship God with
attributes, or those who worship the unmanifested, attributeless
Brahma, is better. So he puts the question— -

Those devotees who, ever steadfast, thus worship Thee
(Saguna) and those again, who worship only the Imperishable -
and the Unmanifest (Nirguna) which of them are better versed
in Yoga? 1. .

10/9—With their mind and their life wholly absorbed in Me, enlightening
each other.
11/55—He performs all actions for Me, he is devoted to Me and he depends
on Me. . oe
In the following verses before this chapter there is the description of the OO
devotees who worship formless God.
4/34—Know that (knowledge of the self) by prostration, by question, by service.
4/39—The man who is full of faith obtains that knowledge. :
5/8—Sankhyayogi who knows the truth (reality) thinks, "" I do nothing at all.""

8/13—Uttering the mono-syllabled Om, the Brahma and remembering Me.
9/15—Others worship Me in My absolute formless aspect. |
"
1382,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1327
(those devotees) stands, for the same striver for whom 'Yah'
(who) and ‘Sah’ (he) terms, have been used by the Lord in the
fifty-fifth verse of the eleventh chapter. Such strivers, worship .
God, Who is endowed with attributes and form. .

Here the term 'Evam’', directs towards the fifty-fifth verse
of the eleventh chapter.

'Satatayukta (ever steadfast), is he who believes 'I am
only God's.’

The strivers (devotees), who have full faith in God, have .
the only aim of God-realization. Therefore while undertaking, ae
either spiritual activities, such as adoration and meditation etc., -
or mundane activities, such as business or service or earning
their livelihood, such devotees ever remain steadfast in Him, by
thinking of Him 1.e., they have their affinity only for Him. -

A striver, commits an error if while performing spiritual
activities, he thinks that he has affinity for God, and while
performing mundane actions, he believes that he has affinity for Oo
the world. The reason 1s, that he has not fixed God-realization,
as the only aim of his life. If he realizes that the only aim of ,
human life is, God-realization, and sticks to it, all his activities
will conduce him to God-realization.

If an aspirant thinks of the Lord, at the beginning of an :
activity and at its end, it means, that he has thought of the Lord, OO
even during the performance of the activity, in the same way as
a businessman while making entries in his account book, gets SO
much absorbed in it, that he even forgets who he is, and why
he is making those entries and calculations. Though it seems ,
forgetfulness, yet it is not forgetfulness because he has his aim
in his mind. Similarly a striver, always believes that he is only
God's and whatever action he performs, is only for Him. Therefore
while engaged in performing duties his apparent forgetfulness of
God is not in fact forgetfulness of God as he has no doubt in
his conviction that he is only God's and working only for God. |
"
1383,"1328 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12 |
'Tvam paryupasate'—Here, the term ‘“I'vam'—should be
interpreted in a wider sense, covering all the forms with attributes
assumed by Him during His various incarnations, as well as the ~
form with which He resides in His Divine Abode, and also He,
Who is called by different forms and names, according to, the
beliefs of devotees.
The term 'Paryupasate’ means, ‘to worship well.’ As a chaste
wife through her body serves her husband, thinking of him in his
absence and serves his parents and performs all household duties, =
only to please and serve him, so does a striver, being engrossed ene
in Him, by chanting His names, through thinking and meditation, °
by rendering service to beings and through the performance of
mundane duties, worships Him alone, without attaching the least
importance to perishable objects and actions. -
'Ye caépyaksaramavyaktam'—The term 'Ye', stands for the
strivers, who worship attributeless and formless, God.
The term 'Aksaram’, stands for the Imperishable Brahma,
Who. is all Truth, all Consciousness and all Bliss consolidated,
(it will be explained in the third verse of this chapter). ""
_ The term ‘Avyaktam’, stands for the Unmanifested, Who is
incomprehensible to the senses. Here, the use of two adjectives
‘Aksaram' (imperishable) and 'Avyaktam' (Unmanifest), has
been made for attributeless and formless Brahma (It will also BO
be explained in the third verse of this chapter).
It seems, that the Lord by using the term 'Api' (only), wants
to compare the devotees who worship the Lord endowed with
form, with those devotees who worship only the formless Absolute
(Brahma), by regarding Him, superior.
'Tesam ke yogavittamah'—Here the term ""Tesam', stands for
both the devotees—those who worship God with attributes, and
also those, who worship attributeless God. In the fifth verse of
this chapter, this term has been used for devotees who worship
attributeless, God, while in the seventh verse, it has been used :
"
1384,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1329
for devotees, who worship God with attributes. So Arjuna wants
to ask, which of the two, is better. |

If we give a serious thought to the answer offered by the -
Lord to Arjuna's question, we come to realise the importance
of Arjuna's question. oo

From the second verse of this chapter to the twentieth 7
verse of the fourteenth chapter, Lord Krsna went on speaking
continuously. This is the only occasion when Lord Krsna, spoke
continuously for such a long time, by uttering seventy-three
verses. It shows that, Lord Krsna wants to clarify many vital (ren
points. He wants to explain the identity of the Lord, Who ;
is endowed with form, with Brahma, Who is formless; the
means of attaining the two, and the marks of perfect devotees
(Gita 12/13—19) and the wise (Gita 14/22—-25) and how they -
may realize the importance of renouncement, of attachment to
the world. _ | | oo |

It means, that the supreme word, the most secret of all,
for the supreme good of all beings, which the Lord wanted to .
announce, for the welfare of them, was disclosed in response to :
Arjuna's question inspired by Lord Krsna.

Appendix—The Gita being a ‘Yogasastra’, in it “Yoga’
is important. Therefore who is a real Yogavetta?—This is a= AH -
Arjuna’s question. There are three categories of Yogavettas—

(i) Yogavit viz., Yogi, (11) Yogavittara viz., better of the two

Yogis, (u11) Yogavittama viz., the best of all Yogis. Arjuna has

no doubt about ‘Yogavit’ and ‘Yogavittara’ but he has doubt |
about ‘Yogavittama’.

Link:—The Lord, answers Arjuna's question, in the next
verse pertaining to the superiority of worshippers who worship
God with attributes, and those who worship, attributeless God. ,

The Blessed Lord said:

and are endowed with supreme faith, are the most perfect Yogis, -
in My opinion. 2
Comment:— :

[Lord Krsna explained this fact of his own accord without -
being asked in the forty-seventh verse of the sixth chapter, but
Arjuna could not understand it (verdict). So he put this question,
in the first verse of this chapter. Similarly, strivers on account OS
of not having keen desire and curiosity do not understand the
spiritual teaching imparted in religious discourses by the saints -
and the scriptures as it was told in a general way not as an
answer to a specific question. Therefore they disregard them
though general impression remains but if they have a keen desire
to know it, they pay special attention and listen to it, with faith eee
and also study the scriptures carefully. Therefore, strivers should
listen to religious discourses and study the scriptures carefully,
considering these as meant for them and translate those teachings |
into practice. ] | - .

""MayyaveSya mano ye mam nityayukta updsate'—When a
person's mind, 1s concentrated, he thinks automatically of persons
or object he loves.

The expression. 'Nityayuktah (ever steadfast or earnest),
means that the striver himself should remain absorbed in God,
by thinking, ""only God is mine and I am only of God."" When
"
1386,"Verse 2] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1331
a striver has a firm resolve (aim), to realize God, his mind and
intellect automatically, get absorbed in Him. On the other hand,
if his aim is not God-realization, his mind and intellect cannot be -
absorbed in Him, in spite of, his best efforts. Mind and intellect, ;
are the instruments which remain under the control, of the agent.
So, when a striver himself gets absorbed in Him, the mind and
the intellect, automatically get absorbed in Him. .
_ A striver, commits an error, when he instead of getting
absorbed himself practises to concentrate his mind and intellect
on Him. So, there is a general complaint, that strivers' mind and -
intellect do not get absorbed in Him. Through the concentration re
of mind and intellect he can attain the state of a trance, but
he cannot realize God. God-realization is possible only, if he
himself, gets absorbed in Him. | -
Real worship, consists in surrendering oneself to God and
believing, ""I am only God's and only God is mine."" When a
man surrenders himself to God, all prescribed actions, including Te
chanting His name, thinking, meditation, service and adoration
etc., are performed, only for Him.
A body, is a fragment of prakrti (nature), while the soul
(self), is a fragment of God. But the self having forgotten the
real affinity for God, assumes affinity for nature and its evolute .
| i.e., body, senses, mind and intellect etc. As soon as, he (the a
self), renounces this assumed affinity, his real and eternal affinity
for God is manifested, and his memory is regained—
""Destroyed is my delusion, as I have gained my knowledge
(memory)"" (Gita 18/73).
It is because of man's (soul's), inclination to matter (nature),
i.e., by deriving pleasure out of it, that he assumes his affinity
for it, i.e., he assumes, ""I am body."" Because of this assumed
affinity for the body, he holds that he belongs to a particular
caste, creed, colour, profession, order of life and regards the
self, rather than the body, as at a stage of boyhood, youth and
"
1387,"1332 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12
old age etc., viz., he does not regard the self, as different from
the body. 7
This assumed affinity for the alien body, and the world, -
becomes so firm, that he remembers it without making any effort.
If he realizes his real affinity, for the sentient and eternal Lord,
he can never forget Him, and while performing all actions, :
such as sitting, eating, drinking, sleeping and waking etc., he
automatically will think of Him. |
A striver, whose only aim, instead of hankering after worldly :
pleasures and prosperity, is God-realization, it means, that he
has started realizing his real affinity, for God. When he fully
realizes this real affinity, he has not the least desire, to hanker
after worldly pleasure and prosperity, through his mind, intellect,
senses and body etc. -
The self (soul), in spite of being a fragment of God, assumes
Its affinity for nature, because it wants to derive pleasure out Ree ee
of it. So a striver, having a disinclination for the world, should
realize his real affinity for God, and should have an inclination -
for Him, only. |
'‘Sraddhaya parayopetaste me yuktatama matah'—A striver,
has faith in a thing or person etc., whom or what he considers |
as the best and then he follows the principle, decided upon by a
him, without deviating from it.
A person's mind, is fixed on the object or person he loves,
and his intellect is fixed on the object or person in whom he |
has faith. If he is a lover, he seeks-company of the beloved, but
if he has faith, he ever remains ready to carry out, the wishes
of the adored one.
He, who loves only God, ever realizes his affinity for Him,
and never feels any separation from Him. Therefore, such devotees,
are the most perfect in Yoga, in the Lord's opinion.
The fact, which has been pointed out here, by using a plural .
"
1388,"Verse 2] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1333 |
number in the expression ""Te me yuktatama matah (they are the

best in Yoga in My opinion), has already been explained, in the

singular number by the Lord in the forty-seventh verse of the _
sixth chapter, by the expression ‘Sa me yuktatamo matah’ (he is -
considered by Me, to be the best Yogi).*

Appendix—‘Sa yogi paramo matah’ (Gita 6/32), ‘sa me oe
yuktatamo matah’ (Gita 6/47), ‘te me yuktatama matah’ (Gita
12/2)—Thus the Lord has mentioned the Supreme (the most
perfect) Yogi; it means that a striver may practise anyone of
the paths such as Karmayoga, Jnanayoga etc., but he is the |
best (Supreme) who has attained devotion. A Karmayogi and a CO
Jnanayogi finally attain devotion but a Bhaktiyogi from the outset
remains absorbed in devotion (which is the fruit of Karmayoga
and Jnanayoga), therefore he is the best of all.

Knowledge and devotion—both are equal as far as the freedom
from sufferings is concerned, but devotion is more glorious than
knowledge, because in knowledge there is ‘akhanda’ (integral) Fie en
relish (bliss) but in devotion there is infinite relish. Infinite .
relish increases every moment, in it there are waves of singular .
bliss which make it unique. As in the world when we come to | :
know that ‘this is a paper currency’ or ‘this is a watch’ etc., :
our ignorance in regard to that is wiped out, similarly by Self- .
realization, ignorance of the self is removed. When ingorance is ee
removed, a man is delivered from sufferings, fear and bondage
of birth and death etc. But love (devotion) is more singular than

* In the fifty-fourth verse of the eleventh chapter the Lord has declared,

“By single-minded devotion I can be known and seen in reality and also entered

into.” But in the fifty-fifth verse of the eighteenth chapter the Lord declares for :
the devotees who woship the attributeless Absolute (Brahma), ""He, having known

Me in truth, forthwith enters into Me."" Here He does not declare that he can see

Him. Thus only the devotees who worship the Lord with attributes can see Him.

This is a singularity of such devotee.

The Lord in the forty-seventh verse of the sixth chapter has declared the
striver full of faith in His form with attributes the best Yogi. Thus such a striver
(devotee) is very loving to Him.
"
1389,"1334 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12 :

knowledge. Knowledge has no access to God but devotion has.

Knowledge is realized by the Self but love is relished by God

and He is the knower of love. God is not hungry for knowledge z

but He is hungry for love. Having attained salvation, a Jianayogi

is satisfied with the self and content in the self (Gita 3/17), but
having attained devotion, a devotee is not satisfied but his bliss  —_

is enhanced more and more. Therefore the last stage is love, |

not salvation. |

As ‘this is a paper currency’—it is known, then ignorance of |
it is removed but if there is greed to get more and more money, ee
the money provides a special taste (relish). Similarly in devotion ;
there is a singular relish. It means that in the world as greed
for money has attraction for a man, similarly love for God has
attraction for a devotee, but knowledge has no such attraction. ~
Greed for wealth causes downfall but love elevates a devotee
to a higher peak of devotion than knowledge does. There is not Se
that relish in an object and in the knowledge of that object as
is in the attraction for that object.

In the Path of Discrimination (Jnanayoga) there is assumption :
of both the real and the unreal together, so a trace of subtle ego
persists for a long time. This subtle ego viz., the trace of ego
persists even on having attained salvation. This subtle ego does ee
not lead to the cycle of birth and death but it is a stumbling
block to have ‘abhinnata’ (intimate love or inseparation) with
God. Therefore by following the path of discrimination, the wise
men (Jnanis) or philosophers can attain salvation; but they may
become ‘abhinna’ with God viz., they may have true devotion
(love) for God—this is not the rule. It 1s because of the subtle
ego that there are differences of opinions among philosophers
and their philosophical thoughts. But in the path of faith
(Bhaktiyoga), a devotee from the outset, does not assume any
other independent existence besides God. Therefore God and he
become inseparable (abhinna). Both being inseparable viz., with :
"
1390,"Verse 2] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1335
the dawn of sincere love, the subtle ego and all philosophical
differences of opinions evolving from the subtle ego are totally
wiped out* viz., dvaita, advaita, dvaitadvaita, visistadvaita etc.—all _
become the manifestation of God which is a reality. Therefore :
the devout devotee who has realized *Vasudevah sarvam’ (All is
God), does not insist on a particular sect (opinion) but respects
all sects equally. As he does not insist on any sect, so he never
disrespects any sect. It means that unity by virtue of love is
superior to the unity through knowledge. In knowledge distance
and distinction are wiped out, but intimacy (Abhinnata) is not
developed. But in love distance, distinction and separation—all the CO
three come to an end. Therefore in love (devotion) there is real
non-dualism. In love there is so much power that by it a devotee
becomes the favourite deity of even God. The strivers following
the path of knowledge, regard salvation the Supreme, then how :
can they realize the glory of love or devotion (premabhakti or
parabhakti). (Parabhakti is the Supreme devotion in which a _ —
devotee has a unique attraction for God which increases every
moment?) In salvation there is ‘akhanda ananda’ viz., constant
bliss (relish) but in love there is endless bliss which increases :
every moment. This ‘Premamukti’ is far superior and is the
more advanced stage to salvation, Self-realization, realization
and ‘Kaivalya’ etc.t | | |
Karmayoga and Jnanayoga—these two are the worldly
paths (Gita 3/3). But Bhaktiyoga is not the worldly path viz.,
is not the path followed by human beings. He who remains
absorbed in God is “bhagavannistha’ (dependent on God and
His grace) viz., his state is unearthly. His means and end— |
both are only God. Therefore Bhaktiyoga is the means and
* prema bhagati jala binu raghural, abhiantara mala kabahum na ja.
(Manasa, Uttara 49/3)
fT Sravanam kirtanamh visnoh smaranam padasevanam

(Srimadbha. 7/5/23)
"
1391,"1336 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12
also the end; so it has been declared—‘bhaktya saiijataya bhaktya’
(Srimadbha. 11/3/31) viz., devotion evolves from devotion.
Sravana, kirtana, smarana, padasevana, arcana, vandana, dasya, -
sakhya and atma-nivedana—this is nine types of ‘Sadhanabhakti’
(devotion as a means)* and then is the devotion as an end
which 1s called ‘premalaksanabhaktt’ (Sadhyabhakti) (the Supreme -
devotion) which is the aim to be attained by all the disciplines
such as Karmayoga and Jnanayoga (Gita 18/54). This devotion as
an end (aim), is the Supreme essence which is to be attained.

In Jnanayoga a striver, by attaching importance to the re
discrimination between the real and the unreal, renounces the /
unreal. By renouncing the unreal, the entity of the renouncer
as well of the thing renounced, remains for a long time,
therefore in Jnanayoga, the total renunciation of the unreal is 7
very much delayed. In Karmayoga, a striver renders service to
others with the things he has. The worthless things of inferior |
quality are renounced easily but it is difficult to renounce a
things of Superior quality. But if those things are used in
rendering service to others, the unreal is easily and quickly -
renounced. In Bhaktiyoga a devotee regards the world as God’s
or as God’s manifestation, and thus the world (the unreal) is
extinguished and God remains. Therefore by Karmayoga the
unreal (inert) is more quickly renounced than by Jnanayoga Te
and by Bhaktiyoga it is more quickly renounced than by
Karmayoga, because in devotion the unreal does not persist at
all—‘Sadasaccaham’ (Gita 9/19). Therefore Karmayoga is Superior
to Jnanayoga—‘tayostu karmasannyasat karmayogo viSisyate’
(Gita 5/2) and Bhaktiyoga is Superior to Karmayoga—

* dvaitarn mohaya bodhatpragjate manisya,

bhaktyartham kalpitamn (svikrtamn) dvaitamadvaitadapi sundaram.
(Bodhasara, Bhakti. 42)

Dualism before Self-realization causes delusion but after Self-
realization the accepted-dualism for devotion is superior to the non-
dualism of Jiianayoga.

. PITS IS -

Link:—In the preceding verse, the Lord declared the
worshippers of God, with form and attributes, to be the best |

Yogis. So a question arises, whether worshippers of attributeless

Absolute (Brahma), are not the best Yogis. The Lord, answers

the question, in the next two verses:—

But those, who worship the Imperishable (Aksara), the

Undefinable, the Unmanifest, the Omnipresent, the incomprehensible,

the Unchanging and the Immobile, the constant, by restraining all

the senses, being even-minded everywhere, engrossed in the welfare ee

of all beings, also come to Me. 3-4

Comment:—

The term 'Tu' (but), shows that. worshippers of the formless

Brahma, are different from those, who worship the Lord with form.
‘Sanniyamyendriyagramam'—Having given the term

‘Sanniyamya’, with two prefixes 'Sam' and ‘Ni’ the Lord, lays

emphasis on full control over all senses. If they are not fully

controlled, there is difficulty in the worship of attributeless

Absolute. The senses of devotees who worship the Lord with

attributes, are fixed on Him and so there is not much need of
"
1393,"1338 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12 |
controlling the senses, as for devotees who worship attributeless
Brahma. Such devotees, having no base for thought, without
controlling the senses, can think of the objects of senses, and -
thus can perish (Gita 2/62-63). Therefore, for devotees who
worship the attributeless God, it is necessary to control, not

only the senses fully, but also the mind, because so long as,

there is attachment of the mind with the objects of senses, the
Absolute (Brahma), cannot be attained (Gita 15/11).

In the Gita, control over senses has been considered very
essential, in the Disciplines of Knowledge and Action. There is oe
no such stress in the Discipline of Devotion. .

'‘Acintyam'—The term stands for the Absolute, Who is beyond
the reach of senses and mind, because they being evolutes of
prakrti cannot even know and think of prakrti; then how can -
they know and think of God, Who transcends prakrti (Nature)?

God can be known, only by the self. |

""Sarvatragam'— God is all-pervading and limitless. So, he re
cannot be attained, by limited mind, intellect and senses.

'Anirdesyam'— 'Anirdesyam’, is that which cannot be defined, ""
through language or speech. Only that, which is accompanied
by caste, quality, action and is confined through space, time,
thing and individual can be defined, or hinted at. How can .
the all-pervading and sentient God, be defined or hinted at, by Oe
insentient language? |

""Kiitastham'—This term, stands for the Absolute, Who
while pervading all space, time, things and individuals, remains
unvitiated and uncontaminated. He always remains uniform and .
unaltered, without undergoing any change, at all. On a ‘Kuta’
(anvil), different instruments and ornaments etc., are shaped, but
it ever remains, the same. Similarly, in spite of birth, existence
and destruction of different beings and objects, God pervading
them, remains the same. He is not affected by, their birth,
existence and destruction. |
"
1394,"Verse 3-4] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1339 .

'Acalam'—Brahma, is totally immovable and free from
change, while prakrti (nature), is movable.

'Dhruvam'—The Absolute, Who is certain and eternal is
called 'Dhruva'. Out of all the eight adjectives used for Him, this -
one is the most important, otherwise people may misunderstand,
whether He exists or not, as all the other adjectives, are in the
negative. He ever exists and never ceases to be, in the least, :
""The world seems to exist, because of His existence or light""

(Manasa 1/117/4).

'Aksaram'—The Absolute, Who is Truth, Consciousness and
Bliss, solidified, is never destroyed. He is imperishable. He does BC
not suffer, any diminution.

'‘Avyaktam'—He is unmanifested, He is incomprehensible
to the mind and senses, and He is also devoid of any form .
or shape.

'Paryupasate'—The term, here stands for real worship of
devotees, who worship the attributeless, Brahma. Real worship, ar ee
consists in remaining established in God, by identifying the self
with Him, without any desire and egoistic notion. -

He, Who is denoted by these eight adjectives, is an imperfect
form of Brahma, because Brahma is incomprehensible, even to
the intellect. But worship, which is offered with these eight
adjectives, is the worship of attributeless Brahma, and this worship —
results, in the attainment of attributeless Brahma. He cannot be
an object of intellect. Keeping in view these eight adjectives, of
the absolute, the adoration made, is called 'Paryupasate.' This
is real worship of the Absolute, and it results, in merging with
the Absolute. :

In order to explain the existence of God, two kinds of
adjectives—in the negative and in the positive, have been given.

The negative adjectives, imperishable, indefinable, unmanifest,
"
1395,"1340 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12 7
unthinkable, immovable, unlimited, show that God is different
from prakrti (nature), while the positive adjectives, such as
omnipresent, uniform, eternal, and nouns—truth, consciousness
and bliss, show the Lord's, independent existence. -

Innate, Inactive, Absolute, beyond the states of activity and
non-activity, is the illuminator, of activity and non-activity. The
different adjectives, have been used, so that the intellect may :
have-a conception about Him, and so it may reflect upon, that
Absolute.

In the. Gita, the description of God and the soul (self), is
almost the same. The adjectives, which have been used here, Be
for God have been used for the soul—as in the twenty-fourth
and the twenty-fifth verses of the second chapter, ‘omnipresent’,
‘immovable’, 'unmanifest' and 'unthinkable’ etc., and in the sixteenth
verse of the fifteenth chapter, ‘unchangeable’ and ‘imperishable’ -
have also been used, for the soul. Similarly, in the twenty-fifth
verse of the seventh chapter, the adjective imperishable has been ee
used for God, while in the fifth verse of the fourteenth chapter,
it has been used for soul.

Both God and the soul, pervade everywhere. 'The whole
world is pervaded by God (The Supreme Person)’ (8/22, 18/46)
and ‘all this world is pervaded by Me’ (9/4). Similarly, in the
seventeenth verse of the second chapter, it is said about the soul oe
also, ""All this is pervaded by the soul.""

As the sight of two eyes does not clash nor sounds in spite
of being wide-spread do not conflict with the ears, so does
(according to the dualistic principle) the all-pervasiveness. of
God, not strike against the all-pervasiveness of the soul, both
being without form or shape.

‘Sarvabhitahite ratah'—In the Discipline of Action,
renouncement of attachment, a sense of mine, desire and
selfishness, is very important. When a person, uses objects such
as the body, riches and property, in rendering service to others,
"
1396,"Verse 3-4] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1341 -
without regarding them as his and for him, his attachment, a
sense of mine, desire and selfishness, are naturally renounced.
When a body is used, in rendering service to others, egoism
is renounced, and when objects are used for others, a sense of .
mine, is renounced. A striver following the Discipline of Action,
considers the objects in his possession as the objects of those
people, to whom he renders service. So it is indispensable for
a 'Karmayogi', to remain engrossed in the welfare of all beings. |
But in this verse as well as in the twenty-fifth verse, of the fifth
chapter, the Lord declares that the ‘Jhanayogis' (the followers of
the Discipline of Knowledge) remain engrossed in the welfare a
of all beings. It proves that the path of action, is necessary -
even in the path of knowledge, in order to renounce affinity,
for actions totally. a

Here, a point needs attention. The service rendered with -
the body, objects and actions is limited, because all objects
and actions, are limited. But, he who has a feeling for the
welfare of all beings, renders unlimited service, because there OO
is no limit of the feeling. Therefore, a striver, should use the
objects for the welfare of all beings, by regarding these as theirs, ”
without attachment. Because of unlimited feeling, when a striver
renounces his affinity for matter totally, he realizes the unlimited
Essence, i.e., God. When a person, regards objects as his own,
he has an egoistic notion, as well as, unevenness of mind. But, OO
when he uses these for others, by regarding these as theirs, his
egoistic feelings and unevenness of mind, come to an end. On
the other hand, a common person may usé every object of his
own, in rendering service to his kith and kin, but because of
his attachment and a sense of mine for them (limited feeling),
he cannot realize, the limitless God. So, in order to attain, the
limitless God, a striver should possess limitless feelings, of the
welfare of all beings.

A striver, following the Discipline of Knowledge, because
"
1397,"1342 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12 :
of lack of dispassion cannot renounce worldly objects, by
considering these as illusory, so long as he attaches importance
to perishable objects. But a striver, following the Discipline of
- Action, can renounce these easily, by using these in rendering ~~
service, to others. The former, can renounce objects only, if
he has a keen dispassion, while the latter can renounce these
with a little dispassion, because he uses them for the welfare of
others. Thus affinity, for matter is renounced easily, by being
engrossed, in the welfare of all beings, and the path of action,
is an easier one. : .
_ Devotees, who worship an attributeless Absolute, specially —
hold two views, (i) Whatever appears in the form of insentient
or the sentient, and moving or the unmoving, is soul or Brahma
(the Absolute). (ii) Whatever appears, is perishable, transitory
and unreal. Thus, realizing the seen, as unreal, and whatever -
remains, is soul or Brahma.

A striver, following the path of knowledge, cannot attain ee
perfection, merely by learning 'All is Brahma’, so long as he
has attachment in his mind i.e., he possesses evil propensities, ;
such as desire (lust), and anger etc. So, like a Karmayogi, it
is necessary for him to remain engrossed, in the welfare of all
beings, to attain perfection, by renouncing attachment.

Those strivers, who having assumed the world, as unreal, oo .
meditate on God in solitude, their physical renouncement of
actions, proves useful, in their spiritual path. But, by mere
renunciation, they do not attain to perfection (Gita 3/4). For
attaining perfection, dispassion for pleasure and detachment from
the body, senses, mind and intellect, are very essential, and for :

_ dispassion and detachment, they should remain engrossed, in the
welfare of all beings. When they lead a lonely life, away from
the world, they have an egoistic notion, which can be removed
by being engrossed, in the welfare of all beings.

A striver, should not only be detached from the world, but
"
1398,"Verse 3-4] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 1343
also from the body, because the body is also a part of the world.
So long as, he identifies himself with the body, and remains
attached to it, even by living in loneliness, he cannot attain
his aim. In order to, efface egoism and attachment, he must be -
engrossed, in the welfare of all beings.
Also it is not possible for a striver, ever to remain in
solitude, because he has to come into contact with society, for
the maintenance of his body. Moreover, if he is not completely
dispassionate, because of his pride, in dealing he may be harsh,
and so his egoistic notion, does not come to an end. Therefore, he -
cannot achieve his aim. In order to get rid of this harshness, he ee
should remain engrossed, in the welfare of all beings. A striver,
following the Discipline of Knowledge may not render service,
on a large scale but the Lord declares, that he will attain Him,
as he is intent on the welfare, of all beings. -
It is necessary for both the strivers, whether they worship
God with attributes, or God without attributes to, remain engrossed So
in the welfare, of all beings. When a striver thinks that his own
welfare, is different from the welfare, of all beings, it means -
that he has egoistic feelings which is a stumbling block to God-
realization. When a striver, performs all actions (eating, drinking,
sleeping etc., as well as chanting His name, meditation, study
of the scriptures etc.,) for the welfare of the world, his egoism, oe
comes to an end and God's power, which is ever engaged in the
welfare of all beings, supports him. |
Real service, does not consist in offering objects and in bodily
service, but in thinking of the welfare, of all beings without any
selfish motive or reward. One should serve them, as he serves .
the limbs of his body, without expecting any fruit.
As a common man, without receiving any moral teaching,
serves his body very scrupulously, without being proud of the
act, so does a God-realized soul, remain engrossed in the welfare,
of all beings, through the likeness of the self (Gita 6/32) without |
"
1399,"1344 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12
having the least pride or egoism. A striver, should ever follow
the foot steps of such a God-realized soul, scrupulously.
-  ""Sarvatra samabuddhayah'—Devotees, who. worship -
attributeless and formless Brahma, have evenness of mind in
all persons and objects, because they therein behold only Him
who is equally pervading in all of them (Gita 5/19). |
The Lord, wants to explain, that devotees following the path
of knowledge, besides thinking of God in solitariness, should also
be even-minded, in practical life. Secondly, in loneliness,they
cannot remain totally lonely, because, the body is also a part —
of the world. When_a striver beholds the world, and the body —_—-
as one, it means that he is even-minded. But, if he views the
body and the world, as separate, 1t is uneven-mindedness. Real
loneliness, consists in beholding only God everywhere, and in _
remaining established in Him, and having renounced egoism,
attachment for the body, senses, mind and intellect etc., totally.
Such a striver is really, even-minded. Sem

In the Gita, 'evenness of mind' means beholding the same
Lord, pervading everywhere, rather than the same dealings with -
everyone. The Lord, in the eighteenth verse of the fifth chapter,
mentions five beings in this regard—a learned and humble
Brahmana, a cow, an elephant, a dog and a pariah. None, can |
have the same dealings, with all of them. The similar dealings a -
are not possible. One should not resort to any such dealings. A
striver beholds God, in all of them. As in different ornaments
made of gold, there is nothing but gold, so does a striver, have.
equal vision as he heholds God, everywhere.

A liberated soul, has equal vision, as he beholds God,
everywhere. Such liberated souls, are models for strivers. A
striver has no equanimity, because he accepts the existence of
worldly objects. When he ceases to accept, their existence, he
attains, equanimity.

A striver tries to behold God everywhere, while for God- |
"
1400,"Verse 3-4] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1345

realized souls, there is nothing but, God. They are even-minded,

because they behold only God, everywhere. This natural state, of

a realized soul, is an ideal for strivers. They aim at it. In what
proportion, the independent existence of non-self, the strivers -
accept, in that proportion they are not, even-minded. The lesser

the independent existence, in their mind, the more even-minded,

they become. Strivers try to see the Absolute, everywhere. But :
the intellect of the God-realized soul, is naturally influenced by

the Absolute.

‘Te prapnuvanti mameva'—The Lord declares, that devotees .
who worship the attributeless God, also attain Him. It means, mea
that He, is in no way different, from the attributeless Brahma -
(Gita 9/4; 14/27). He is both endowed with attributes and also,
attributeless.

In these two verses, the Lord has mentioned four factors ~
pertaining to the worshippers of attributeless Brahma—(1) The
conception of attributeless Absolute, (2) condition of the striver, _

(3) the nature of worship, (4) what the striver, attains. -

(1) In response to Arjuna's question, which he put in the |
second half of the first verse, using two adjectives, imperishable -
and unmanifested, pertaining to the attributeless Absolute, the
Lord, in order to, give a more detailed description, uses five
adjectives in the negative (imperishable, indefinable, unmanifest,
unthinkable and immovable), and three in the positive (omnipresent, Te me
fixed and eternal) forms.

(2) Such strivers, behold the attributeless Absolute, everywhere,
all the time, in all objects and persons etc. It is, on account of
body consciousness and acceptance of the separate existence of
worldly objects, there is desire to enjoy sense-objects and thus
sense-objects are enjoyed. Strivers of the Absolute do not regard,
any independent existence of anything, except God. So they do
not attach any importance, to worldly pleasure and do not want
to enjoy, these because, for them such pleasure has no separate
existence. Such strivers, being even-minded, remain engrossed,
"
1401,"1346 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12 |
in the welfare of all creatures. : |
(3) His worship, is that he has a constant eye, on the
attributeless Absolute. -
(4) The Lord declares, that those who worship attributeless
God, also attain Him. It means, that God with attributes, and
God, Who is attributeless, are one and the same. :
Appendix—Whatever the characteristics of Brahma |
(incomprehensible, changeless, immobile, imperishable,
unmanifest) the Lord has mentioned here, the same characteristics
have been stated of the soul as—‘incomprehensible’ (2/25), =
‘changeless’ (15/16), ‘immobile’ (2/24), ‘imperishable’ (5/ ~
16,18), ‘unmanifest’ (2/25) etc. The purpose of stating the |
same characteristics is that the Soul and Brahma (the Absolute)
are the same in nature. If the Soul assumes its affinity for the -
body, it becomes ‘Jiva’ (the embodied Soul), but the same Soul,
having renounced its affinity for the body, 1s Brahma viz., the
Self having identification with the body is different from Brahma ne
otherwise it is Brahma. Therefore having attained Brahma, the
worshipper merges into the Being of the worshipped—‘idarh -
jhanamupasritya mama sadharmyamagatah’ (Gita 14/2). “Te
prapnuvanti mameva’—God whether He is ‘saguna’ (with
attributes) or ‘nirguna’ (attributeless) is the same, therefore the .
devotees who worship attributeless Brahma, also attain God. The a
Lord means to say that His attributeless and formless entity is
not different from His entire form.
‘Sarvabhutahite ratah’—The world, the Soul and God—from
all the three points of view all of us are one. It means that all |
the bodies are one as they are all within ‘apara prakrti’ (lower
nature) and all the Souls are one as they are within ‘para prakrti’
(higher nature). Therefore when a striver becomes evenminded
in all beings—‘sarvatra samabuddhayah’ and he looks on all as
one, like his own body—‘atmaupamyena sarvatra samarh pasyati
yo rjuna’ (6/32), then he develops the feeling of remaining |
"
1402,"Verse 5] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1347 |
engrossed in the welfare of all beings. The reason is that when
he regards all the bodies as his own body, he neither thinks anyone .
evil nor wishes anyone evil nor does anyone evil. Thus having -
renounced evil, welfare of others is naturally done by him. Not ;
only this but he even does not think of doing evil to the person —
who does him evil because he regards all beings as his own;
in the same way as if there is a sudden cut on the tongue with a
one’s own teeth, one, by being angry, does not break one’s own
teeth—‘uma santa kai ihai badal, manda karata jo karai bhalai.’
(Manasa, Sundara. 41/4). :
The service, which is rendered to others by renouncing evil, » ee
can’t be done by offering the biggest charity and by performing
the most virtuous actions. Therefore renunciation of evil is the
root of good (virtue). He who has renounced evil, can be -
‘sarvabhutahite ratah’ (engrossed in the welfare of others). _

Link:—In response to Arjuna's question, the Lord in the OS
second verse, declared devotees who worship the Lord, with
attributes the most perfect in Yoga, while in the third and the ”

Comment:—
""KleSo'dhikatarastesAmavyaktasaktacetasam'—Strivers whose |
"
1403,"1348 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter12
thoughts are set on the Unmanifest, are those who regard the
worship of the attributeless Absolute as superior but whose minds
have not entered the attributeless Absolute. In order to enter __
the Absolute, a striver should possess three qualities—interest —
(inclination), faith and qualification. Such strivers, having heard |
the glory of the Absolute, develop a bit of inclination and having
faith, start the spiritual discipline; but because of identification —
of the self, with the body and because of lack of dispassion,
their minds, do not comprehend the Absolute.

The Lord, in the twenty-seventh and the twenty-eighth verses
of the sixth chapter, explains that a Yogi who has become one with | -
God, experiences easily infinite bliss, viz., the Eternal (Brahma).

But here, by the terms ‘greater difficulty’ He explains, that the

minds of these strivers, unlike those, who have become one

with God, have not got absorbed, in the Eternal. Their minds,

are only attached to the Absolute. It means, that these remain

attached to the bodies, but having heard the glory of worship of —..... .. .
the Unmanifest, and regarding this worship as superior to others,

they get attached to it. But attachment is always to the body not

to the Unmanifest. It is atonement with the manifest or absorption

in which involvements strain for such body-centred people.

In the fifth verse of the thirteenth chapter, as well as, in several
other verses, the term 'Avyaktam' (unmanifest), has been used for ok
Prakrti (nature), while here in this verse, it stands for Brahma
(the Eternal or the Absolute) Who is attributeless and formless.

The reason is, that Arjuna, in the first verse of this chapter, put

the question pertaining to the worship of God with attributes and
form and also of Brahma the Imperishable and the Unmanifest. .
So here, it stands for the Eternal or the Absolute, rather than
nature, because object of worship is God, not Nature.

In the fourth verse of the ninth chapter, the expression
'Avyaktamiurtina, has been used, for the unmanifested form with
attributes. So, a question may arise, that in this verse also, the
"
1404,"Verse 5] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1349
expression 'Avyaktasaktacetasam' may stand, for those whose
minds are set on God, Who is unmanifest and endowed with
attributes. But this interpretation is, also not proper, because
in the first verse, the term ""[vam', stands for God, Who is -
endowed with attributes and form while the term 'Avyaktam'
and 'Aksaram’ stand, for the attributeless and formless Eternal
(Absolute). What is Brahma? The Lord, has already answered
the question in the third verse of the eighth chapter, by declaring
that Brahma (the Absolute), is the Imperishable. There also, the
term ‘Imperishable' has been used for God, Who is attributeless
and formless. Therefore, in response to Arjuna's question, in Oe
which he used the term 'unmanifest' and ‘imperishable’ the Lord :
answered, by using the term ‘unmanifest' which stands for God,
Who is attributeless and formless.

The expression 'KleSo'dhikatarah’, (difficulty is greater) -
primarily shows, that the imperishable (formless) Brahma, is
very hard to reach, by those who are attached to their bodies.* ee
Further, it shows, that all devotees, worshipping the attributeless
Absolute, have to face great difficulty, than those who worship
God with attributes, from the first stage, to the last one. :

Now, it is explained how the worship of God, Who is endowed :
with attributes, is easy, while the worship of attributeless God, Bo
is difficult.

Worship of God with attributes—

1. Such a striver can easily concentrate his senses and mind,
on God, because He is with form and attributes. He can think
of Him, listen to His life-story and pastimes and can adore Him

* Strivers are mainly of two types:—

First are those strivers who are inclined to the spiritual practice after
listening to religious discourses, having good company and studying the
scriptures. Such strivers face greater difficulty in spiritual practice.
"
1405,"1350 _ SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12
easily, (Gita 8/14). Therefore, there is less possibility of his
dwelling on worldly objects.

2. It is attachment to the world, which causes difficulty in -
the spiritual path. Such a striver depends totally on God, as a |
kitten depends on its mother. For such a striver, God secures

_ what is not already possessed, and preserves what he already /
possesses (Gita 9/22). In the Manasa also, it is mentioned that |
God, like a mother who looks after a child, cares for devotees,
who worship Him and depending only on Him (3/43/2-3). So,
they easily get rid of worldly attachment. | ee

3. Such strivers, attain the Lord, quickly (without delay) -
(Gita 12/7). | |
4. The Lord, Himself, destroys the darkness born of ignorance,
of such strivers (Gita 10/11). | ~

5. The Lord, straightway delivers them from the ocean of |
death-bound existence (Gita 12/7).

6. If devotees, take refuge in Him alone, the Lord by His
grace, releases them from any subtle vice, if it subsists in them
(Gita 18/58, 66).

7. They have full faith in the Lord, Who pervades everywhere. |
It is because of their faith, that they take refuge in Him, and
the Lord grants them the Yoga of Discrimination i.e., wisdom ee
by which, they attain Him (Gita 10/10).

8. They believe, that the Lord, is most gracious to all beings.

So by His grace, they cross all obstacles and they quickly attain
Him (Gita 18/56—58).

9. No one can, ever remain even, for a moment, without
doing work (Gita 3/5). So a devotee has to offer those actions,
to God. By doing so, he is easily liberated, from the bondage
of actions (Gita 18/46).

10. Such a striver, can easily renounce objects, by rendering
service to others. He can renounce these more easily, if they are |
"
1406,"Verse.5] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1351
offered to deserving persons, and much more easily, if they are
offered to God.

_ 11.Such a striver, needs love and faith, more than -
discrimination and dispassion. As Draupadi, had a feeling of
enmity, towards the Kauravas, yet because of her faith in the
Lord, He manifested Himself, before her, when she invoked
Him.* The Lord, pays attention to the devotion and faith, of
His devotees, rather than their defects. Everyone, can accept
his affinity, for Him.

Worship of attributeless God— :
1.For such a striver, it is extremely difficult to control a -
fickle and restless mind, and senses, on the attributeless and
formless, Absolute. Because of the lack of any base and because
of the lack of dispassion, there is greater possibility for a striver, _
to think of the sense-objects. | |
2.The difficulty is greater, for a striver who is attached to
body. A striver, worshipping the attributeless Absolute, wants to Te
get rid of this attachment, through discrimination, by depending
upon his power, like a baby-monkey, which (by depending upon -
its strength) catches hold of its mother, in order to protect itself
(Gita 18/51—53). Therefore, in the Manasa, the Lord compares
the wise with an adult son, while a devout devotee, with a small ;
son (3/43/4). Thus, by depending on his strength he is not free Be
from attachment, easily.
3.In the Gita, in the thirty-ninth verse of the fourth chapter,
the term 'Acirena’, refers to attainment of peace, after having
gained Self-realization. It does not declare, that Self-realization :
is instantly, possible.
4.Devotees of the attributeless Absolute, attain to Him,
* This factor applies to those devotees who have a exclusive devotion to
the Lord and depend only on Him. He manifests Himself before them as soon
as they call Him. Moreover He shoulders their responsibility to remove their
defects also. _ |
"
1407,"1352 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12
with their own effort (Gita 13/34). |

5. They, themselves attain to His being (Gita 5/24).

6. Such strivers, come to know their defects late, and they -
realize these with difficulty. But, having realized these properly,
they can also remove them. :

7. In the thirty-fourth verse of the fourth chapter and the
seventh verse of the thirteenth chapter, the Lord has advised .
such devotees, to receive instructions, from a teacher, through
devotion. In this discipline, a preceptor, is a must. Not being
fully aware, of the perfection of a preceptor or the preceptor not ee
being perfect, it becomes very difficult for strivers, to maintain -
their faith. Thus, it involves delay.

8. They cannot realize His grace, because they regard Him
attributeless, formless and indifferent. So they don't realize His _
grace, and they have to overcome obstacles, by their own effort.

Thus, Self-realization may be delayed.

9. A Jiianayogi, also offers his actions to Prakrti. But, it can BO
be done only, if his discrimination is fully aroused, otherwise he
will be bound to action, by having a pride of doership. - -

10. It is very difficult, for such a striver to renounce objects,
by regarding these as illusory, so long as, he has attraction for
them, and has egotism and attachment for the so-called his body,
and name. TF

11.Such a striver, attains the Absolute, only when he
becomes qualified and deserving, by possessing discrimination
and a burning dispassion, which cannot be cultivated, so long
as, a devotee is attached to the world. :

""Avyakta hi gatirduhkham dehavadbhiravapyate'— Generally,
the terms 'Dehr' and 'Dehabhrt’, stand for the embodied beings.
They also stand, for the soul or self. Here, the term ‘Dehavadbhih*,

* Here according to the Panini formula ‘'Matupa’ is the prefix is
Tadasasyas minniti matup' (5/2/94). The term ‘Dehavadbhih' stands for
those who have identified themselves with their bodies. ° .
"
1408,"Verse 5] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1353 |
stands for those who identify themselves with their bodies, because
in the first half of this verse the expression 'Avyaktasaktacetasam’
(whose minds are set on the unmanifested), has been used for -
Strivers. who worship the attributeless Brahma (the Absolute). It
shows, that they regard worship of the attributeless Absolute, as
superior to other worships, but their minds have not entered the
Absolute, because of their identification with the bodies. It is |
because of their identification with their bodies, that they have
to face greater difficulty. |
In the worship of the attributeless Absolute, the main :
obstacle, is that a devotee identifies himself, with the body. So ee
the term 'Dehavadbhih' has been used. In order to, remove this
identification, the Lord has given his guidance in the thirteenth
and the fourteenth chapters, though Arjuna did not put the question. -
The Lord, clearly explains, that a body (field), is different, from
the soul (Knower of the field) in the first verse of the thirteenth
chapter, in order to remove the identification with body. _ |
Here, the expression ‘Avyakta gatih, has been used, to attain
the goal, the attributeless and unmanifested Brahma. Common .
people, identify themselves, with bodies. So they face greater
difficulty, in reaching the Unmanifested. If they cease to
identify themselves with bodies, they can attain the goal of the
Unmanifested, very easily and quickly. a a
Appendix—In the worship of the attributeless Brahma, the
worshipper who identifies himself with the body is Jiva (the
embodied Soul), and if he renounces this identification, he is the ,
worshipped one (Brahma). The assumed affinity with the body is
the main obstacle in the identification of the Self with Brahma. |
Therefore for the body-conscious beings, the allurement with
the attributeless Absolute is difficult and is delayed. But in the
worship of God endowed with attributes, disinclination for God,
rather than identification with the body, is the obstacle. Therefore
the striver, who worships God endowed with attributes, having
"
1409,"1354 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12
a disinclination for the world, inclines to God and instead of
depending on the spiritual practice, depends on God. Therefore
God delivers him quickly from the ocean of birth and death = _
(Gita 12/7, 8/14). This is the singularity of the worship to God -
endowed with attributes.
In this worship to God endowed with attributes, a devotee does .
not attach importance to the renunciation of the world, by regarding .
it as unreal, because he holds the insentient and the sentient,
the real and the unreal—All is God only—‘sadasaccahamarjuna’ |
(Gita 9/19). Therefore worship of God endowed with attributes a
is the worship of entire God. In the Gita, God endowed with ~— -
attributes, has been regarded as “samagra’ (entire) and Brahma,
Jiva, Karma, Adhibhiita,; Adhidaiva and Adhiyajna—they are all
within the entire God (Gita 7/29-30). Therefore by reflecting -
upon the Gita, it seems that worship of the attributeless
Absolute (Brahma) is the worship of a fragment of entire God,
and worship of God endowed with attributes (saguna) is the BS
worship of entire God—‘tvarh paryupasate’ (Gita 12/1), “mam
dhyayanta upasate’ (12/6). -
He, who worships a fragment of the entire (God), also finally
attains the entire—‘te prapnuvanti mameva’ (Gita 12/4), ‘tato
marh tattvato jfiatva visate tadanantaram’ (18/55). Therefore those -
who want to worship the attributeless (Absolute), may worship OB
Brahma, but they should not slight God endowed with attributes.
It is very dangerous (harmful) for the worshipper of attributeless
God to slight, to blame and to refute saguna (attributes) viz., it
is an obstacle for attaining perfection. The reason is that ‘apara
prakrti’ belongs to God, therefore to blame it, means to blame God.
By refuting the attributes, he accepts the existence of attributes,
which is an obstacle, because without accepting their existence,
what will be refuted? Therefore if a striver, without blaming and
slighting the other strivers, practise spiritual discipline promptly,
at last (finally) all strivers, become one because the Divinity is
"
1410,"Verse 6] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1355 -
one.* If a striver remains indifferent to ‘saguna’, he can attain
salvation, but the differences in opinions cannot be wiped out.
But if he pays heed to ‘saguna’, all differences come to an end
and a striver attains the entire form of God. i.

Comment:— -
[In the fifty-fifth verse of the eleventh chapter, out of the
five marks of a devotee, having single-minded devotion, there are
three expressions (Matkarmakrt, Matparamah and Madbhaktah), OO
in the positive and two (Sangavarjitah and Nirvairah) in the
_ Negative aspect. Here also, the same expressions have been used, -
in a different manner, in this verse—
(1) The expression 'Sarvani karmani mayi sannyasya,' stands
for ‘'Matkarmakrt’. :
(2) The term ""Matparah’, stands for the term 'Matparamah'’, SO
(looks on Me as Supreme God).
(3) The expression ‘Ananyenaiva yogena’, denotes
""Madbhaktah’, (devoted to Me).
*vadanti tattattvavidastattvarh yajjianamadvayam
brahmeti paramatmeti bhagavaniti Sabdyate
(Srimadbha. 1/2/11)
‘The enlightened exalted souls call the Divinity, which is knowledge
personified and unparalleled, by these three names—Brahma, Paramatma and
Bhagavan.’
"
1411,"1356 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12 :

(4) Those devotees, who remain absorbed in Him with
single-minded devotion, become '‘Sangavarjitah' (free from
attachment). |

(5) When, they become free from attachment, they become -
‘Nirvairah' (without enmity), and also free from other evils
such as envy, jealousy etc. In order to attach importance to this
feeling of ‘freedom from enmity’ the Lord while describing the |
marks of devotees who have attained perfection, in the thirteenth
verse, first of all mentions 'Advesta’ (freedom from ill-will or
hatred). Therefore, a striver should not bear the least 11l-will to .
anyone]. OO

""Ye tu sarvani karmani mayi sannyasya'—The term 'Tu' (but), |
has been used, in order to emphasize the fact that worship of
the Lord with attribute, is easier than that of the attributeless |
Absolute. :

Though the term 'Karmani’ (actions), is in plural, and so it
stands for all actions, yet the adjective 'Sarvani’ has been used So
so that all actions—mundane (for the maintenance of the body
and of earning livelihood), as well as spiritual (adoration and ;
meditation etc.,) and other prescribed actions performed through :
body, speech and mind may be included (Gita 9/27).

Here, by the expression 'Mayi sannyasya’, the Lord does |
not mean to say, that actions should be physically renounced, oo
because none can ever remain, for even a moment without
performing action (Gita 3/5; 18/11). Also, abandonment of
action, sanctioned by scriptures, or out of delusion, is declared
to be 'tamasi' (of the nature of ignorance) (Gita 18/7), and if
it is abandoned, because it is painful 1.e., from fear of physical :
suffering, this abandonment is 'rajasika’ (passionate) (Gita 18/8).

In this way, affinity for actions cannot be renounced. In order
to be liberated, from the bondage of actions, it is necessary to

renounce the sense of mine, attachment and the desire for their
fruit, because these three bind him.
"
1412,"Verse 6] - SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1357

When a striver aims at God-realization, he has no desire
to acquire objects; and by thinking himself of God, he instead
of being attached to the body etc., is attached, only to God.

When he surrenders himself to God, all his actions, are also ~
surrendered to God. |

In the Gita, actions which are surrendered to God, have been
called 'Madarpanakarma’, 'Madarthakarma’ and 'Matkarma’. |

1. 'Madarpanakarma’', are those actions, which were started
with any other aim but are surrendered to God, either during
their performance or after. oe

2. ‘Madarthakarma’, are actions which are performed only for -
God, from the very beginning. They are performed by obeying
Him, in order to please and realize Him.

3. 'Matkarma’ are all mundane actions (business and service -
etc.,) and spiritual actions (adoration and meditation etc.,) which are
performed, for the sake of God by regarding them as God's.

In fact, all actions should be performed, with the only aim, On
of God-realization.

A devotee, who performs actions, in the above-mentioned :
three ways, in order to attain perfection, has not the least affinity
for actions, because he has neither desire for fruit nor a sense of
doership nor attachment to objects, body, senses, mind, intellect
and other actions etc. Actions of a perfect soul, are naturally, SO
surrendered, while a striver, performs actions with the aim of
surrendering these to God. |

As a Bhaktiyogi, is liberated from the bondage of actions,
by surrendering his actions to God, so does a ‘Jianayogi, get -
liberated, being detached from actions by believing that they are
performed by prakrti (nature).

""Matparah'—It means ‘surrender to God, by regarding Him,
as most adorable and supreme’. Such a devotee, who adores
God with attributes, becomes merely an instrument in His hands.
"
1413,"1358 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter12
Therefore, he regards virtuous actions as performed by God.

~ Moreover, he has no desire for worldly pleasures, because it is
not his aim. Thus, being free from desires, evil actions, are not
performed by him. : -

""‘Ananyenaiva yogena mam dhyayanta  upasate'—This |
expression, means that such a striver adores God, with a single-
minded (exclusive) devotion and he wants to attain Him, by
depending on Him only. For God-realization they give more rather
all importance to Divine grace not to their efforts or discipline.

It means that He is both the end and the means of the devotee.
Such a devotee chants His name and glory and meditates on Be
Him by having the only aim of God-realization. |

To those whose mind is fixed on Me, I straightway deliver them ;
from the ocean of the death-bound world, O Partha (Arjuna). 7
Comment:—

""Tesamaham samuddhart& mrtyusamsarasagarat bhavami 7 a
naciratpartha mayyaveSitacetasam'—'Mayyavesitacetasam’, are
those strivers, whose aim is only God-realization, whose minds
are exclusively set on Him, and who themselves remain absorbed
in Him.

As an ocean consists of nothing but water, so there is nothing,
but death in the world. Nothing in the world is immune, from the
buffets of death. Everything is perishing (dying) all the time. So
the world has been called an ocean of death-bound existence.

In his daily life man, is bound to face both desirable
and undesirable circumstances. Feelings of agreeableness and |
"
1414,"Verse 7]  SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1359 |
disagreeableness towards him are inherent in a man. Through

such feelings he develops for attachment and aversion, for them.

Thus he gets bound (Gita 7/27). Even strivers, become a prey _
to attachment and aversion, by being attached to their own sects .
and saints, and by having aversion to the other sects and saints

and so they cannot cross the ocean of death-bound existence,

quickly. Partiality to sects, is delusion, which binds a man. So

the Lord, has laid special emphasis on the freedom from pairs

of opposites time and again.*

A striver, whose all likes are centred in God has exclusive -
devotion. in God; and all his dislikes are centred in the world -
viz., by rendering selfless service, he renounces the desire for
favourable circumstances, he can be very easily liberated, from
the bondage, of the world. 7

The Lord rewards, men in whatever way, they approach
Him (Gita 4/11). So He declares, that He is same to all beings
(Gita 9/29). But to those, who love him only, who perform all Ts
actions, only for Him and who looking upon Him, as the supreme
goal, ever remain absorbed in chanting His name, thinking of
Him, and meditating on Him, He straightway delivers, them from
the ocean of death-bound existence.T

Appendix—In the fifth verse of the sixth chapter the .
Lord stated for a common striver that he should emancipate — oe
himself by his ownselfi—‘uddharedatmanatmanam’ but here He
declares, “I emancipate them from the ocean of death-bound

* Free from dualities (2/45) (5/3); freed from the delusion of dualities
(7/28); liberated from dualities (15/5); neither an aversion to disagreeable /
action nor an attachment to an agreeable one (18/10); casting aside attraction
and aversion (18/51).

+ The terms 'Samuddharta bhavami' also include the ideas that a devotee
who worships God with attributes, crosses (overcomes) all obstacles by His
grace and attains Him (Gita 18/56—58); God takes up all the burdens and
cares Of His devotees (Gita 9/22); ""Out of compassion for them, I, dwelling
within their Self, destroy the darkness born of ignorance"" (Gita 10/11); ""I
liberate them from all sins"" (Gita 18/66).

world”—‘tesamaharhn samuddharta’. It means that first a striver

starts his spiritual practice himself. Out of those strivers he, who
depends on God, God liberates him from the bondage because -
he has this faith in God, that He would liberate him. He without
worrying for his emancipation, remains engrossed in adoring God.

His means and end—both are only God. But the striver, who :
follows the Discipline of Knowledge, he himself is responsible |
for his emancipation.

On Self-realization, devotion is attained—this is not the :
rule; but having attained devotion, the self is certainly realized. a
Therefore the Lord declares— -

mama darasana phala parama anipa
jiva pava_onija sahaja__sariipa
(Manasa, Aranya. 36/5) ~

God confers on his devotees both Karmayoga (equanimity)
and Jnanayoga viz., destroys their ignorance—born of darkness _ |
(Gita 10/10-11) because God designated as Bhagavan is entire
by nature.

Because of body-consciousness the striver, who follows
the path of knowledge, his mind is attached to the
Unmanifest—‘avyaktasaktacetasam’ (Gita 12/5). But a devotee’s ;
mind is fixed on (Bhagavan) God—‘mayyaveSitacetasam’. In _
the Path of Knowledge, discrimination is important while in
devotion for faith (belief) is important. In the Path of Knowledge
‘apara prakrti’ is to be renounced, while in devotion it is the
manifestation of God itself.

Comment:— _
""Mayyeva mana adhatsva mayi buddhith nivesaya'—According
to the Lord, only those persons are most perfect in Yoga, who
have realized their eternal union, with God. In order to make 7
strivers perfect in Yoga, the Lord orders them through Arjuna,
to fix their minds and intellects on Him, by regarding Him, as -
the most loving and supreme Goal.
We have our eternal union with God, but we do not realize
it, because we do not fix our mind and intellect, in Him. ”
Therefore, the Lord directs us, to fix our mind and intellect in -
Him, and then we shall realize that we live in Him i.e., we are
established in Him. :
‘Fix thy mind on Me'—it means, that the mind should be
diverted from the thought of the world, to God. 'Fix thy intellect oe
in Me’'—it means, that the striver, should have a firm resolve,
that he is only God's, only God is, his and He is the Supreme,
to be attained. By doing so, he will cease thinking of the world
and his attachment to it will come to an end, and he will have
affinity, only for God.
"
1417,"1362 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12 ;
Fixation of intellect, is more important than, fixation of

mind. If one has, a firm resolve, with his intellect, his mind

will also accept, that resolution. If a person's aim, is not God-

realization, he may attain accomplishment (Siddhis), but he will :

not realize God. Therefore, a striver should have a firm resolve, |

that he has to realize God. Desire for pleasure and prosperity,

is the greatest obstacle to this firm resolve. It 1s the desire, for

mundane pleasures which induces him to acquire money, honour

and praise etc. Thus the intellect of the irresolute, is scattered

and endless (Gita 2/41). But, if he has the resolve only to :

realize God, this resolve is so sacred and powerful, that the Lord ae

becomes ready to account, even a most sinful one, righteous. It

is merely through his resolve, that he soon becomes righteous

and attains eternal peace (Gita 9/30-31). -
‘I am only God's and only God is mine'—this resolve, to a

striver seems to have appeared in the intellect. But, in fact, he is

_ already established in God, even though he may not know this. Te

The criterion is that this affinity for Him, is never forgotten.

A striver, never forgets ‘I am’, in the same way, as he never

forgets that he is married or he is a disciple, of a particular

preceptor. This resolve, remains established in his inner self,

without practice. This affinity, remains fixed in remembrance,

as well as in forgetfulness, because this resolve of affinity, is in _-

ness. When, even this assumed affinity remains fixed, both in

remembrance as well as in wakefulness, how can the real and

eternal affinity for God, be forgotten? Therefore, when the self

gets fixed in God, the mind and the intellect, automatically get

fixed in Him, and the self merges in Him.
A Common man, identifies the self with the body and

assumes his affinity for the body, mind and intellect etc. But,

everyone can realize the fact, that he is the same, from the oO
"
1418,"Verse 8] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1363 :
childhood to the present time while his body, senses, mind and
intellect etc., have changed. He should firmly believe this fact,
at the present moment (a common man tries to understand this
fact with his intellect, while this is something which is to be -
known, by the self). |

Everyone knows, that the self has not changed and believers
assume, that God has also, not changed. It means, that God and ""
the self, belong to one class. On the other hand, a body, senses,
mind and intellect, have changed and the world is also changing.

Thus this kaleidoscopic world and body, belong to another similar -

class. An uniform and permanent self, and God, are not seen in
their manifested form, while a kaleidoscopic body and the world, 7

are seen in their manifested form. When, the self identifies itself,

with the mind, intellect, senses and body etc., it thinks, that it

is undergoing change, while It being a fragment of God, never -
undergoes any change.

We do not know—'What is I?’ But we know, 'I am’, without ee
any doubt. We also know, the world is never uniform, it constantly
undergoes change. It means that 'T'(the real self), is different from ;
the world. If one of the two is known, in its right perspective,
the other will be automatically known, this is a rule. The real
self which is the substratum, and the illuminator of 'T', is sentient
and eternal. It has no affinity with, the transitory world. But, a
it has its natural affinity, for God. This is Self-realization. On an
such realization one's mind and intellect, are automatically fixed
in Him.

""Nivasisyasi mayyeva ata itirdhvam na _ samSayah'—The |
expression ‘Ata urdhvam' means, that as soon as mind and ""
intellect, totally get fixed in God 1.e., a striver, is not at all
attached to the mind and intellect, he will realize God.

The Lord declares, ""Having fixed thy mind and intellect
in Me alone, thou shalt live in Me, undoubtedly."" It shows
that Arjuna had some doubt. So, the Lord uses the expression
"
1419,"1364 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12
'Na samSayah' (no doubt). What is doubt? Generally, people
think that God can be realized only, if they perform virtuous
actions, have good conduct, they meditate on God by leading ;
a secluded life, and so on. In order to, remove this doubt, the .
Lord declares, that all these means joined together are not so |
valuable as fixation of the mind and intellect in Him, and by
having God-realization as the aim; and by doing so, they will |
realize Him, undoubtedly (Gita 8/7).

So long as, the intellect attaches importance to the world,
and the mind thinks of the world, a man should think that (in ee
spite of being established in God, naturally) he is established, in -
the world. This establishment or attachment to the world, leads
him to the cycle of birth and death.

Therefore, by removing his doubt, the Lord exhorts Arjuna _
not to worry about his situation, after he has fixed his mind and
intellect in Him. As soon as, his mind and intellect are fixed in
Him alone,he will undoubtedly, reside in Him. a nO

A Striver's, only duty is to fix his mind and intellect, in
God. When his mind is fixed on God, he will not think of the -
world, and when his intellect is fixed in God, he will not depend
on the worid. Thus, without thinking of the world and without
depending on it, he will think of God and depend on Him and
it will lead him, to God-realization. ee

Here Citta (the faculty of cognition), should also be included
in the 'mind', and 'egoism', should be included in ‘intellect’, because
without fixing Citta (the faculty of cognition) and egoism, it
cannot be said, ""Thou shalt live in Me alone."" ;

The soul is a fragment of God, Who is the only master of
the entire universe. But, It attracts, a fragment of the world, (body,
senses, mind and intellect etc.,) towards It, by regarding them
as Its own (Gita 15/7) 1.e., It becomes their master. It forgets,
that being a fragment of God It always remains fixed in Him,
but It has accepted Its separate existence, in the same way, as
"
1420,"Verse 8] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1365
a foolish son in spite of being, an heir to his multi-millionaire
father's entire property and riches, by being separate from him,
regards a flat of a huge building, as his own. But, when the son, _
realizes his mistake, he comes to know the reality that he is the
heir to his father's entire property. So the Lord declares, that as
soon as, he surrenders the so-called mind and intellect, to Him
(which are really His as He is the owner of the entire universe,
including the mind and intellect), he, being free from attachment
to the mind and intellect, will live in Him, undoubtedly (because
in fact he being His fragment, already lives in Him). :
The Lord, in the fourth verse of the seventh chapter, described -
the earth, water, fire, air, ether—these five subtle elements, mind,
intellect and egoism, the eightfold division of His nature, which is
lower nature (Apara Prakrti), while in the fifth verse He described _
His higher nature, the soul (Para Prakrti). Though both these
- _ natures, belong to God, yet the latter being a fragment of God,
is superior to the former (Gita 15/7). But the higher nature SO
(soul), by an error regards the lower nature as Its own, and for
Itself, and is thus bound 1.e., becomes the cause of Its birth, in -
good and evil wombs (Gita 13/21). Therefore, the Lord exhorts
Arjuna, to offer the so-called his mind and intellect, the lower
nature to God (which are really His). By doing so, his affinity
for the mind and intellect, which he has assumed by an error, TO
will be renounced, and he will realize his true affinity for God,
which is eternal and axiomatic.
God cannot be realized, by a particular method, such as
meditation etc., because those who depend on such methods,
depend on the body, mind, senses and intellect etc., which are
insentient. God, Who is sentient cannot be bought, through
objects which are insentient, because all these objects cannot
be equivalent to Him. |
"
1421,"1366 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12 |
Worldly objects, are acquired through performance of actions

(efforts). So, a striver thinks, that God can also be realized

through actions, such as spiritual practice etc. -
His belief is confirmed, when he studies the life-stories .

of Manu-Satariipa and Parvati etc., who realized God, through

penance. But in fact, it is not so. God is realized only, when the

assumed affinity for the insentient (Matter), is totally renounced. |

This fact, applies in those cases also, where it seems that they

have realized Him, through penance. In fact, He is ever-realized

to everyone, but He is veiled when a person accepts his affinity ee

for the insentient. As soon as, he renounces this assumed affinity, — -

God is revealed to him. Therefore, those strivers, who hold that

they can realize Him, through spiritual practice are in the wrong.

Spiritual practice, is useful only in renouncing the assumed affinity _

for the unreal i.e., insentient (Matter). Without understanding

this secret, if a striver depends on spiritual discipline, and is

attached to it, his affinity with matter persists. Till the least TO

value, is attached to matter, God-realization is difficult. As soon

as, It is renounced, He is realized. So a striver, should renounce -

his affinity totally, for matter, through spiritual practice. This — |

affinity, for matter is easily renounced, when spiritual discipline,

is practised only with the aim of God-realization. -
Appendix—Mind and intellect are God’s ‘apara prakrti’ a _

(Gita 7/4-5). Inspite of being God’s prakrti viz., nature, the ‘apara

prakrti’ possesses a different nature (inert and kaleidoscopic)

from that of God. But ‘para prakrti’ is not of a different nature |

from that of God. Therefore ‘apara prakrti’ is not uniform and .

untainted like God but the self is such ‘mama sadharmyamagatah’

(Gita 14/2). Mind and intellect belong to the class of ‘apara

prakrti’ viz., they are fragments of Prakrti but we (the Self) are

the fragments of God. Therefore the Self belongs to a different

class from mind and intellect. There is attraction and union in

the entities belonging to the same class, rather than to those |
"
1422,"Verse 8] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1367
belonging to different classes—This is the rule. Therefore mind

and intellect can’t be merged in God, only the Self can be merged

in God. A striver commits an error that he, by assuming the
independent existence of mind and intellect, by keeping the
Self aloof, tries to merge his mind and intellect in God. But the

reality is that only the self is merged in God, mind and intellect

are not merged. When the Self merges in God, the mind and
intellect lose their existence, and only God remains. The reason

is that in fact mind and intellect have no existence of their

own, the self has given them existence ‘yayedam dharyate ”
jagat’ (Gita 7/5), ‘manahsasthanindriyani prakrtisthani karsati’ me
(Gita 15/7). Therefore in the Gita, where there is the description ,
of fixing the mind on God by the expressions ‘mayyasaktamanah’

(7/1), ‘manmana bhava’ (9/34, 18/65), ‘mayyavesya mano ye -
mam’ (12/2), ‘mayyeva mana adhatsva mayi buddhim niveSaya’

(12/8), ‘maccittah satatarh bhava’ (18/57) and so on, that is indeed

the method of fixing the Self on God. When a striver tries to —
fix the mind and intellect on God, they are not fixed but the

Self is fixed—‘nivasisyasi mayyeva’. The reason is that a man’s .
(selfs) nature is that he gets fixed where his mind and intellect

are fixed. As in the direction in which the needle moves, so does

the thread follow it, similarly where the mind and intellect are
fixed, the Self is also fixed there. By assuming the existence —
of the world, by valuing it and by being attached to it, the

mind and intellect are fixed on the world and by their fixation,

the Self is also fixed on the world; therefore the Lord orders

to fix the mind and intellect on Him so that the Self may have
disinclination for the world. As when a goldsmith heats up gold :
in the fire in order to purify it, then the adulterated metal is

removed and pure gold remains, similarly when mind and intellect

are fixed on God, they are separated from God and the Self

merges into God viz., only God remains. In the Srimadbhagavata

the Lord declares— —
"
1423,"1368 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12. |
visayan dhyayatascittarn visayesu visajjate
mamanusmaratascittam mayyeva praviliyate

(11/14/27)

‘By thinking of the sense-objects, the mind gets entangled :
in sense-objects, and by thinking of Me the mind gets absorbed |
in Me viz., the mind ceases to exists.” _

It means that when a striver tries to fix the mind and intellect
on God, they instead of being fixed, are merged into Him because
at the root, the Apara Prakrti is God’s nature only. When the
‘mind and intellect are steeped in God, they have no independent =
existence but only God exists—‘*Vasudevah sarvam’. In other a
words the mind and intellect are diverted from the world but =
they cannot grasp God, therefore they lose their independent |
existence and only God remains. | |

In the Path of Knowledge the Self is important while in -
devotion God is important. Therefore a Jiiani gets established
in the Self—‘samaduhkhasukhah svasthah’ (Gita 14/24), while a
devotee gets established in God—‘nivasisyasi mayyeva’. By getting - |
established in the Self, constant (akhanda) bliss is relished and
by getting established in God infinite (endless) bliss is relished
which increases every moment. By getting established in God,

a devotee beholds God everywhere (Gita 6/30) because he has

already had the feeling that God 1s omnipresent.

In this verse the fixation of the mind, the intellect and the ~ :
Self is in sequence. When the Self is fixed, ego is wiped out.

In love (devotion), the mind is fixed; in faith, the intellect
is fixed. ‘Fixation of the mind and intellect on God’ means
to love God and to have esteemed belief in God viz., having
renounced lovingness and value for the world, only to love and
value God. | |

Comment:— : |
‘Atha cittam samadhatur na Saknosi mayi sthiram

abhyasayogena tato mamicchapturh dhanafijaya'—Though the term

‘Mana’ stands, only for the mind, yet being related to spiritual |

discipline mentioned in the preceding verse here, it is proper to Tres nes

take it both for the mind and the intellect. -
The Lord, says to Arjuna, if he is unable to fix his mind on

Him, he should seek to reach Him by constant practice of Yoga.
‘Abhyasayoga’ is a compound word in which 'Abhyasa’,

means fixation of the mind on something repeatedly, while

""Yoga' stands for equanimity. Thus, repeated (constant) practice -

by having equanimity is ‘Abhyasayoga’. Adoration and chanting of

the Lord's name etc., performed with the aim of God-realization, 7

is also 'Abhyasayoga’. oe |
Only constant practice without ‘Yoga’ (union with God or

equanimity) will induce, a striver, to have several mundane ,

desires about wife, sons, riches, honour, praise, health and other -

favourable circumstances etc., because many diverse and endless,

are the thoughts of the irresolute (Gita 2/41). Therefore, actions

of such a person, will not lead to ""Yoga’. ""Yoga’ is only possible,

when the aim of every action, is only God. .
When a striver, having the aim of God-realization, practises

chanting of His name, etc., different thoughts come to his mind.

Therefore, a striver, having a firm resolve that he has only to

realize God, should become, indifferent to all other thoughts.

Here, by the expression 'Mamicchaptum’, the Lord declares
that he should seek to reach Him, by constant practice, while in

1425,"1370 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12 :
_ the preceding verse, He exhorted Arjuna to surrender his mind
and intellect to Him. So a striver, may think that mind: and
intellect can be surrendered to Him (fixed on Him), through
practice of concentration and then God, will be realized. But the
Lord does not mean it so. He means to explain, that a striver
can realize God through practice, if he has a firm resolve, only
to realize Him. |
When a striver, practises repeatedly chanting His name,
adoration and learning the scripture etc., his mind is purified, |
and the desire for God-realization, 1s aroused. When he remains ——_____——
equanimous, in success and failure, desire becomes keen. This -
keen desire, makes him restless. This restlessness for God-
realization, destroys. the mundane attachment, as well as, sins
of infinite births. Then he develops an exclusive devotion to -
Him, and so separation from God becomes unbearable for him.
If he cannot live, without Him, He also cannot live without him,
and so he attains Him. oO :
A striver, does not attain Him, immediately, because he
bears his separation, from Him. As soon as, this separation from -
Him, becomes unbearable, God is attained because He pervades,
everywhere. The only weakness of a striver is, that he has not a
burning desire and so he cannot attain Him, immediately. It is
because of his sensual desire, that he thinks that he will be able -
to realize Him, only in future. As soon as, there is restlessness
and a burning desire for God-realization, the desire for sensual
pleasures, will come to an end and God will then be realized,
without any delay. | .
If a striver, in the beginning resolves, that he has to realize
only God, whatsoever may happen in the worldly sphere, he can
very quickly realize God, by anyone of the paths of action, of
knowledge or of devotion.
Appendix—In the twenty-sixth verse of the sixth chapter,
there was mention of ‘abhydsa’ (practice), but here is mention of
"
1426,"Verse 10] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1371 ;
‘abhyasayoga’ which leads to salvation. If there is only practice,

but there is no Yoga, a state will be formed which will not lead

to salvation,

To control the mind or to concentrate it on God again and .
again is ‘abhyasa’. In ‘abhyasayoga’, the mind is not controlled,
but the mind is detached from the Self—‘samatvarhn yoga ucyate’

(Gita 2/48).

If you are unable to practise as above said, be thou intent on -
performing ordained actions for Me; and thus doing selfless actions
for My sake, thou shalt achieve perfection. 10
Comment:— |

‘Abhyase'pyasamartho'si matkarmaparamo bhava'—Here ;
the term 'Abhyase', stands for 'Abhydsayoga’, described in the —
preceding verse. In the Gita, the topic of preceding verse, is
described in brief, in the next verse. The topic of fixing the mind
on Him, and the intellect in Him, described in the eighth verse, a |
was mentioned in the ninth verse, by the expression ‘to fix the
mind’, which also includes intellect. In the same way the term
‘Abhyase’, (in the tenth verse), has been used for 'Abhyasayoga’
as in the ninth verse.

The Lord declares, that if he is unable to practise as
described, in the preceding verse, he should work for His sake.

It means, that all actions (according to one's caste, order of life,
for earning livelihood and for maintenance of the body, as well
as, adoration, meditation and chanting of His name, and other
spiritual activities) should, instead of being performed for mundane
"
1427,"1372 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12 7
pleasure and prosperity, be performed, only for God-realization.
Actions which are performed, for God-realization according to

His direction, are called 'Matkarma’', and a striver who is intent

on performing actions, for His sake, is 'Matkarmaparama’. Such a -
striver, should have his affinity, only for God, and his activities |
should also be performed, only for God.

When a striver, ceases to hanker after mundane pleasure and
prosperity, the forbidden actions, are totally renounced by him,
because it is desire which tends a man, to perform forbidden
actions (Gita 3/37). Therefore, when a striver decides on God-
realization, as the aim, all his actions are in accordance with, OO
scriptural injunctions and they are performed for the sake of ;
God, only. - |

""Madarthamapi karmani kurvansiddhimavapsyasi'— Whatever
has been said, in the first half of the verse by the expression -
‘Matkarmaparamo bhava’, has been repeated in the second half.

When a striver, performs actions only for His sake, he attains, ee |
perfection or God-realization. :

As the Lord, in the eighth verse, explained fixation of the 7
mind on Him, and the intellect in Him, the independent means
of God-realization, and, in the ninth verse, the constant practice
of divine name etc., the independent means to realize Him, so
does He mention here the performance of actions for His sake, _— |
as the independent means to realize him.

As profit in business acts, as an encouragement to a
businessman, and he tries to earn more and more money, and
more enthusiastically, so, when all actions are performed for God's
sake, a striver, develops a keener desire for, God-realization and :
also practises spiritual discipline, more enthusiastically. When he
has such a burning desire, that he cannot bear separation, from the
all-pervading God, God does not remain veiled, but by His grace
He is attained, by him. If a striver's only aim is God-realization,
and he performs all actions only for His sake, it means, that he
"
1428,"Verse 11] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1373 .
has invested his intellect, ability, time and resources, in God-
realization by considering them as the Lord's. What more can
he do than this? The Lord, does not expect anything more, from
him. So He enables him, to realize Him. ~
Appendix—Performance of actions for God’s sake is easier
than practice. The reason is that practice being new has to be done
but actions are performed naturally as a man is so habituated. A
man gets bound by performing actions for himself—‘karmana _ |
badhyate jantuh’. Therefore by offering actions to God, a man
easily attains God (Gita 9/27-28). |
‘Madarthamapi’—this expression means that actions should —
be done only for God’s sake from the beginning. :

mind, senses and intellect etc., (equanimity) and renounce the fruit,

Comment:— ~
‘AthaitadapyaSakto'si karturn madyogamasritah'—In the
preceding verse, the Lord declared, ""Thou shalt attain Me by
performing actions, for My sake"" while, here He declares, ""Thou
shalt attain Me, by renouncing the fruit of all actions."" The ,
former, can be called the path of devotion, while the latter, the
path of action. Both of these are independent means, of God-
realization.
In this verse, it seems proper that the expression
""Madyogamaésritah’ (resorting to union with Me), is related with
"
1429,"1374 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter12 —-

‘AthaitadapyaSakto'si' (if you are unable), because if it is taken

to be related with 'Sarvakarmaphalatyagarn kuru' (do renouncing

the fruits of all actions), because of prominence of dependence

on God, it will become, the path of devotion. Thus, it will not °

be different from the path of devotion described, in the tenth :
: verse, while the Lord wants to explain the path of devotion in

the tenth verse, and the path of action, in the eleventh verse.

Also in this verse, the Lord has used the expression
""Yatatmavan' (subduing mind, senses and intellect), which is more
important in the path of action, because without it, renouncement, |
of the fruit of actions, is impossible. To

If a striver, does not believe in God so much but he
does social service, and he cannot surrender all actions to
Him, but renounces the fruit of action, which is beyond his
power (Gita 2/47), his affinity, for the world, is renounced. -

‘Sarvakarmaphalatyagam tatah kuru yatatmavan'—For a
person, who wishes to attain to Yoga, action (without attachment) _
is said to be the means (Gita 6/3). It 1s attachment, to the fruit

Of action, which binds a man. So if a striver, subdues his senses, ;
mind and intellect, he can easily renounce, the fruit of action. If
a striver does not control his mind, intellect and senses etc., he
will naturally think of sense-objects and then he will be attached
to them, and thus he may perish (Gita 2/62-63). If a striver's
aim, is to renounce the fruit of action, he can easily control his
mind and senses.

Here the expression 'Sarvakarma’, stands for religious sacrifice,

charity, penance, service, and means of livelihood, according
to one's caste and order of life, as well as, all other prescribed
actions. 'Renouncement of the fruit of actions’, does not mean,
physical renouncement but the renouncement of the sense of
mine, attachment and desire etc., for the fruit, of actions.

A striver, following the path of action, should not remain
inactive, by thinking that there is no need for the performance
"
1430,"Verse 11] | SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1375 .
of action, when he does not want to reap its fruit. Therefore,
the Lord warns the strivers, ""Let thy attachment not be to,
inaction” (Gita 2/47). _
In the ninth verse of the eighteenth chapter, also the Lord
while describing the marks of the 'Sattvika tyaga’, explained
renouncement of the attachment to the fruit of actions as the
‘Sattvika tyaga’. .
When actions are performed, having renounced attachment,
to the fruit of actions, the impetus to act, calms down and old |
attachment perishes. Without the desire for fruit of actions, oo
affinity for actions, is totally renounced and new attachment -
does not arise. Then, nothing remains to be done for a striver, |
because it is attachment, desire, a sense of mine for action, and
desire for fruit, which force, him to act. He may, physically _
restrain himself, from performing actions, for a short time. But
so long as, he has attachment and aversion, his nature forces
him, to act. The impetus to act, calms down only when actions -
are performed, without any selfish motive, having renounced
attachment and aversion etc. : .
This means (of the renouncement of the fruit of action), is /
very useful for those strivers, who have no natural reverence or
devotion to words of God, with attributes and form, but have a
natural inclination to do good, to others. | - |
Where the Lord, advises to renounce desire for the
fruit of action, He emphasizes, that it also implies renunciation
of attachment, because with total renunciation of both, desire
and attachment, we are liberated from the bondage of action
(Gita 18/6).
Renouncement of fruit (desire for fruit), of actions, is an
independent means of God-realization. When, desire for the fruit
of actions is renounced, attachment for the sense-objects, perishes
and one attains peace (happiness, of the mode of goodness). If he
does not enjoy that peace, he attains perfection or God-realization
"
1431,"1376 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12 :
i.e., he becomes one, with Him. Oo
In the fifty-fifth verse of the eleventh chapter, the Lord
mentioned, ‘freedom from attachment' as one mark, out of five, -
of a striver-devotee. In this verse, He mentions the renouncement
of the fruit of actions, which is possible only, when there is
_ frenouncement of attachment, to the world. The renunciation of :
fruit of action, as described in the twelfth verse of the chapter,
immediately leads to the attainment of Supreme Peace or God-
realization. Jt means that total renunciation of attachment,
immediately leads to Supreme Peace. Tenses
Appendix—If a striver is unable to perform actions for God’s
sake, he should perform actions by renouncing the desire for
fruit, because it is the desire for fruit which paves the way to
- bondage—‘phale sakto nibadhyate’ (Gita 5/12). ;
Link:—The Lord, from the eighth verse to the eleventh
verse, recommended four methods, one after another, in the
event of Arjuna's failure to.adopt anyone. So a doubt may arise,
whether the fourth, means ‘renunciation of the fruit of action’,
is an inferior means to the other three, as the Lord described
it as the last one, and moreover He did not mention its fruit. In -
order to, remove this doubt the Lord glorifies renunciation and
also mentions about its fruit.

Comment:— : : |
[The Lord, from the eighth verse to the eleventh verse,
recommended four alternative means, in the event of Arjuna's .
failure to adopt the one—fixation of the mind and intellect in |
Him, practice, of divine name etc., performance, of action for His
sake and renunciation, of the fruit of actions. So a person, may
think that they have been mentioned, in the descending order of |
merit. Moreover, in the first three means, there is mention that.
these will attain Him, while in the last one, there is no mention
of it. So they may think, that the discipline mentioned in the :
eleventh verse, is inferior to the other means. -
In order to, remove this doubt the Lord in the twelfth verse,
declares that renunciation of action is an excellent means, which
provides Supreme Peace, immediately. So this method is, in no way, -
inferior to the other three. All the four means, are independent,
to realize God. A striver can follow, anyone of these, according
to his inclination, faith and qualifications etc. -
The other three means, of God-realization are very well-known.
But the last one, that God can be realized by renunciation of |
the fruit of actions, is not so common and familiar. Therefore,
the Lord, in order to, declare its superiority, to the other three
disciplines and to signify its reward, has added the twelfth verse.
So the Lord makes the position clear, in the twelfth verse. ] _
'‘Sreyo hi jiianamabhyasat'—According to the great sage
Patanjali 'Abhyasa’, consists in making effort, again and again,
to be concentrate on something (YogadarSana 1/13).
Here this term ‘Abhyasa’, does not stand for 'Abhyasayoga’, it
_ tefers to practice only, because in this practice (breath restraint
or control of the mind) there is no requirement of scriptural
knowledge, meditation or renunciation of desire for the fruit of
actions. There is 'Yoga’ (union with God) only, when affinity for
matter is renounced, while in such practice, there is dependence
on matter (the body, senses, mind and intellect).
"
1433,"1378 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12 -

Here the term ‘Jnana’, stands for the knowledge of scriptures,
rather than Self-realization, because Self-realization, is the fruit of
all spiritual disciplines. This knowledge, 1s better than practice, in.
which there is neither knowledge of the scriptures, nor meditation,
nor renunciation of fruit of action. -

Spiritual knowledge, which is gained through the study of
scriptures and through the discourses of: saints, but not translated |
into practice, is ‘Jnana’, which is mentioned here. This knowledge,
has been called, better than practice, because practice without
knowledge of scriptures, is not so useful for God-realization,
as is knowledge without practice. Because through knowledge, SO
the desire for God-realization is aroused, and so a striver, can
transcend the world, more easily than he can by above referred
practice. ;

'Jiianaddhyanam visisyate'—Here the term 'Dhyana’, stands for
meditation or concentration of mind, rather than ‘Dhyanayoga’,
which involves the knowledge of scriptures and renunciation of - ,
fruit of action. Such meditation, is better than knowledge, which
does not involve practice, meditation and renunciation of fruit .
of action. Mind is controlled by meditation, rather than by mere
spiritual knowledge. Through meditation, there is accumulation
of energy, which is not possible, through knowledge.

If a striver, utilizes that energy for spiritual progress, he can -
advance very: quickly, which is not possible through knowledge.
Besides, it a striver, through meditation (if he studies scriptures)
can gain true knowledge, more easily, while a striver who studies
scriptures, faces difficulty in meditation, because of volatility
of mind. [In these days also, it can be seen that there are so /
many people who study scriptures, but there are only a few,
who practise meditation. ]

'Dhyanatkarmaphalatyagah'—Renunciation of fruit of action,
without knowledge and meditation, is better than meditation without
knowledge and renunciation, of fruit of action. This expression
"
1434,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1379 -
does not stand for the physical renunciation, of fruit of actions,
but it relates to renunciation of a sense of mine, attachment and
desire for actions and their fruits. Attachment, to all perishable -
objects, which are the fruits of actions, is to be renounced.
Attachment to actions and desire for fruits, lead a man
to bondage, otherwise he is easily liberated, from worldly
bondage. |
The body, senses, mind, intellect, ability, power and other
objects, which a man possesses, have been acquired from the
world. So a 'Karmayogi', without regarding these as his, and for oe
him, utilizes these in rendering service to the world, without any -
selfish motive. Thus their flow is towards the world and then
having renounced affinity totally for the world, he realizes, his
natural affinity for God, which is eternal. So a Karmayogi, need
not meditate on God. Moreover, if he wants to practise meditation,
he can do it very easily, as he has no mundane desires, while a
striver, with desire, faces difficulty in meditation. -
In the sixth chapter, (in the topic of meditation) the Lord
explains, that when the mind restrained by the practice of -
meditation, gets established, in the Supreme Self and it becomes
free from all desires. The mind being matter cannot grasp sentient, |
God. Therefore, on its affinity being cut asunder from the self, |
he (the self) gets established in God, (Gita 6/18, 20), while -
a Karmayogi, having renounced all desires, immediately gets
established in God (Gita 2/55). The reason is, that in meditation,
the mind is concentrated on God, therefore, due to dependence
on the mind (matter) he (the self), has affinity for matter, for a
long time. But in Karmayoga, desire and attachment (matter), |
are renounced and so attachment for the mind, is also naturally
renounced, and he attains Him, very easily and quickly. Thus
Karmayoga, is better than meditation. |
‘Nothing is mine, nothing is required for me, and nothing
is to be done for me’—this is the gist of Karmayoga, and so it
"
1435,"1380 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12 :
is superior, to other paths (Gita 5/2). |
'Tyagacchantiranantaram'—Here the term ""Tyagat', has been
used, for the renunciation of fruit of action. It is very necessary :
to understand, the true nature of renunciation. The self cannot
be renounced by us, nor can anything which is not ours, be
renounced. For example the light and heat of the sun, cannot
be separated from it, nor can it be said that dark and cold, are
separated from the sun, because they are ever separate. Therefore,
only whatever is not ours, but we have assumed it as ours, by
an error, is renounced. __ 7
The soul is sentient and imperishable, while the world is SO
insentient and perishable. But the soul (having forgotten God,
Whose fragment It is) accepts the world as Its. Therefore, there |
is need for renouncing the assumed affinity, for the world. -
Affinity with the worldly objects, is limited, because these
objects, are limited. But their renunciation is limitless. Renunciation
immediately leads to God-realization, because God is also limitless, -
as He knows no limit of clime, time, objects and individuals.
The limitless Lord, is not realized because of our attachment ;
for limited objects. . |
By renunciation of fruit of action, the assumed affinity
for the world is renounced. Therefore, the true nature of |
renunciation, is the renunciation of the assumed affinity for _
actions, and their fruits. | |
Even the fruit of such spiritual activities such as adoration,
meditation and trance etc., should be renounced, because so long
as, these are done for one's self, the individuality subsists. Thus /
one suffers delay, in being free from bondage. Real renunciation,
consists in renouncing affinity, even for the propensity of
renunciation. Here the term ‘peace’, stands for Supreme Peace
or God-realization. :
Renunciation of fruit of action, is better than practice or
knowledge, or meditation. So long as, a striver remains attached
"
1436,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1381
to fruit of action, he (because of the dependence on matter)
cannot be liberated (Gita 5/12).

Therefore, renunciation of fruit of action, is necessary in -
practice, knowledge and meditation also. It is attachment for |
perishable objects, which is the root of disquietude. In Karmayoga,
attachment to actions and their fruits, is abandoned from the |
very beginning (Gita 5/11). So Karmayogi, having no affinity
for matter (insentient), attains, eternal peace (Gita 5/12), in the
form of God-realization. .

An Important Fact Pertaining to the
|

‘Karmaphalatyaga’ (renunciation of the fruit of action), is
another name for 'Karmayoga’' (the discipline of action), because -
in the discipline of action, only renunciation of fruit of action,
is important. This Yoga, was lost to the world, long before the
incarnation of Lord Krsna (Gita 4/2). The Lord by His grace, -
revealed this Karmayoga again, by making Arjuna an instrument
(Gita 4/3), to human beings, in order to encourage them to attain -
salvation, which is generally considered impossible without leading
a secluded life,.or having renounced actions, objects and kith 7
and kin etc. The Lord, means to explain, that a person can attain |
salvation or God-realization, in all circumstances, by performing -
his duties, in a detached way.

In Karmayoga, renunciation of attachment, for the fruit of
action is important. Actions bear fruit, in the form of favourable
and unfavourable circumstances, such as, health and sickness, .
riches and poverty, honour and dishonour, praise and blame, and
so on. If a person has an attachment or aversion for them, he
can never realize, God (Gita 2/42—44).

Perishable things, are fruit of action, such fruit, being
perishable cannot be everlasting. Action, is also not everlasting.

Then how can the fruit of action, be everlasting, when its cause,
"
1437,"1382 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 12 |

1e., the action, is perishable. So, it is an error to be attached to

perishable fruit, or to desire it. Renunciation of attachment, for

the fruit of action, is the seed of, Karmayoga. -
It seems difficult to renounce attachment for actions, and

their fruit, while performing actions, in Karmayoga. But actually,

it is not so. It seems difficult, when a man regards the objects

(body etc.,) required for performance of actions, as his and for |

him. But, when he regards these, as of the world, because they

have been acquired from the world, and he performs his duty, |

his attachment is renounced, and he realizes God (Gita 3/19). In ee

fact, it is not actions which lead to bondage, but it is desire and -

attachment for the fruit of actions, which lead to bondage. When :

desire and attachment for the fruit of actions, are renounced, ail

actions change into inaction (Gita 4/19—23). _
The Lord, declares the unselfish performance of actions,

better than. their physical renunciation (Gita 5/2). According to

the Lord, a Sannyasi is not he, who does not perform actions, ee

but he, who performs actions (duty) without depending on their

fruit (Gita 6/1). A Karmayogi, being free from attachment and -

having renounced all thoughts, easily attain to Yoga (Gita 6/4).

On the other hand, those, who,- having regarded actions and

their fruits as theirs and for them, hanker after pleasures, verily

ingest sin (Gita 3/13). Therefore, in the world it is attachment - oe

for the fruit of action, by which a man is bound (Gita 5/12). He,

who relinquishes the fruit of action, is a man of renunciation

(Gita 18/11). . |
In the Gita, there is a greater emphasis on the renunciation

of the attachment to the fruit of actions, than any other means,

of God-realization. Actions should be performed, renouncing

attachment and desire for fruits (Gita 18/6). A striver should be

attached, neither to virtuous or extraordinary actions, nor should

he have an aversion for evil or ordinary actions, because actions

will be over, but attachment and aversion will continue and these
"
1438,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1383 -
will lead him to bondage. On the other hand, he, who performs
actions, being free from egoism, attachment and aversion, though he
slays people, he really slays not, nor is he bound (by his actions) _——-
(Gita 18/17). Therefore, the Lord declares, that renunciation of
fruit of action, is better than penance, knowledge, action, practice
and meditation etc. Other means, outwardly seem excellent, but
these do not prove much useful, and moreover involve labour. |
Renunciation of attachment to the fruit of actions, leads a striver :
to salvation very easily, in the same circumstances, he is placed
in, and without changing his place or order of life etc. oo
In fact, God is not acquired, but is realized. He is realized, by -
renouncing the sense of 'T' and ‘mine’, attachment and desire, for
the body, mind, senses and objects etc., rather than, by practising
spiritual disciplines. As soon as, affinity for matter is renounced, -
through knowledge, practice, meditation, penance etc., a striver,
realizes God, Who is ever-realized. This affinity for matter, is
renounced, more easily by renouncing fruit of action, than by -
knowledge, practice, meditation and penance etc., because in all
these means, a striver has affinity with matter (body, mind, intellect -
and senses etc.,) and as he regards the body as his and the means
for him. If such a striver, has the aim of God-realization, and
he wants to realize Him, by these means, he realizes Him, with .
delay and difficulty, at last. But in Karmayoga, he renounces his -
affinity, for matter from the very beginning and so he realizes
God, Who is ever-realized quickly and easily. This affinity, is
the main stumbling block to God-realization—this fact does not
become clear to a striver, when he follows other means. /
When a striver, resolves that he has not to perform forbidden
actions, such as theft, falsehood, infidelity, violence, fraud, forgery
and eating forbidden food etc., under any circumstances, even by
thought and speech, then only prescribed actions, are automatically
performed, by him.
A striver, should resolve to relinquish, forbidden actions,
"
1439,"1384 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12 :
rather than perform prescribed actions, otherwise he will feel
proud of performing prescribed actions, and his egoism will
be maintained. Because of his pride, forbidden actions will be =
performed by him. But if he resolves that he will not perform :
forbidden actions, he will not feel proud, because he is not doing
anything creditable, which requires any ability or power. In this
relinquishment, also he may feel proud out of folly. Then, he
should think, that there is nothing to feel proud of, as he is
doing nothing special, in renouncing what should be renounced.
A man, has normal desire to reap the fruit of action, only when
some action is performed. If no action, has been performed, :
only forbidden action, has been renounced,* why can he have
a desire, for the fruit of action? When a person, has no sense |
of doership, attachment for fruit of action, is automatically, -
renounced. This renouncement, naturally, leads him to peace,
which is axiomatic.
The three means (constant practice of divine name etc.,
performance of action for the Lord and renunciation of the
fruit of actions), of God-realization, have been described in the
ninth, the tenth and the eleventh verses. Out of the three (except
the renunciation of the fruit of action), if a thought is given -
seriously, each means, includes the other two, also as (1) In the
constant practice, adoration and chanting the name etc., actions
are done for the Lord and there is no desire for fruit. (2) In the
performance of actions, for the Lord, there is practice and there
is no desire for fruit of actions.
* If a person resolves not to perform forbidden actions, he will either
perform prescribed actions or will not perform actions at all. Prescribed
actions purify the mind and total non-performance of actions conduces a man to
God-realization. Total non-performance of actions means the state of freedom
from lust rather than the state of inactivity or laziness because laziness etc., are
also forbidden actions. ;
"
1440,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 1385 |

First of all, a striver should fix his aim of God-realization.

Then he should, realize his real affinity, for God. After that
anyone of the three means, will lead him to God-realization.

The ease or difficulty, of means depends, on the inclination
and aim of a striver. If he has only the inclination and aim of
God-realization, the means becomes easy, otherwise difficult.

As food stuff, may be different according to the taste
of hungry persons, but hunger before and satisfaction after,
eating the food, are the same; so do strivers have different |
means according to their interests, beliefs and qualifications,
but pain of non-realization of God, and the desire (hunger), for Co
God-realization, are the same for all the strivers. Every striver,
belonging to any class attains the same bliss (satisfaction), in
the form of God-realization.

Here, the Lord has mentioned four means of God-realization
by making Arjuna, a questioner:—

(1) Path of Surrender (2) Path of Practice (3) Performance -
of Actions, for God (4) Renunciation of fruit of Actions.

All the four paths, are equally independent and noble, and -
all of these, lead to God-realization. A striver, can adopt anyone
of them, according to his inclination, faith and qualification, by
regarding it, as the best. |

He should never, consider the means (spiritual discipline), -
followed by him to be inferior to other paths and should never
lose heart, so far as God-realization is concerned. If the only arm
of a striver is God-realization, the means (spiritual discipline),
followed is according to his inclination, faith and qualification, .
and it is practised to the best of his capacity and with promptness
having a burning desire for God-realization, his path will lead
him to that goal, without any doubt. The reason is, that God is
omniscient; He having known the striver's intention and efforts
etc., by His grace influences him towards God-realization.

Every human being has God-realization as its birth mght
"
1441,"1386 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12 .
because the Lord by His grace, has bestowed upon man this
human body, so that he may realize Him. No two persons, can
possess the worldly materials equally, because they acquire these -
according to their fate. But everyone, can realize God equally,
because He is not realized only through actions. |

Dispassion for the world, and a keen desire for God-realization,
are two important factors for the same. Though anyone of these |
two, can induce a striver, to God-realization, yet, a keen desire
is a more powerful means, than dispassion.

Out of the four paths mentioned above, the first three — /
specially arouse desire for God-realization, while the fourth-one -
(renunciation of the fruit of action) attracts a striver to renounce
affinity, for the world.

When a striver, feels that mundane pleasures are painful, and -
he renounces these from his heart, then having his aim of God-
realization, he will automatically progress, towards spiritualism,
and realize Him, by His grace. -

Similarly, as God is most loving to him and he cannot bear
separation, from Him, his unbearable restlessness, will also lead -
him to God-realization. |

Appendix—Practice, knowledge of scriptures and meditation—
these three means are ‘karanasapeksa’ (dependent on instruments), .
but renunciation of the fruit of action is ‘karananirapeksa’ -
(independent of instruments). The reason for declaration that
the renunciation of the fruit is better, is that people regard it
as inferior to other spiritual disciplines. It does not mean that
renunciation of the fruit is superior to the other three means.
But in fact all the four means are highly good and are for those
strivers who aim at renunciation.

In the four means mentioned in this verse, the means
‘madarthamapi karmani’ (performance of actions for God’s
sake) mentioned in the tenth verse, has not been included. The
reason is that in “‘madarthamapi karmani’ the spiritual discipline |
"
1442,"Verse 13-14] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1387
culminates in devotion. Therefore devotion and renunciation—both
are highly good means. .

Here the renunciation of the fruit of action should mean .
renunciation of the desire for the fruit of action. Desire is .
internal while renunciation of the fruit of action is external. Even
when the fruit for action is renounced, the desire within may
linger. Therefore a striver should aim at the renunciation of .
the desire for the fruit of action. When the desire is renounced,
the striver is delivered from the wheel of birth and death.
Salvation is not attained by renouncing things but it is attained
by renouncing desires. oO

1443,"1388 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12 |
and compassionate to all, who is free from the sense of
mineness and egoism, and is even-minded in pleasure and
pain, forgiving, ever content, self-controlled, unshakable in
determination, with mind and intellect dedicated to Me—a Yogl, ~
My devotee, is dear to Me. 13-14 a
Comment:—
'‘Advesta sarvabhitanam'—A person, can bear ill-will to °
another person, in two ways— (1) By creating, an obstacle, to
the acquirement of something desirable, such as wealth, honour,
praise etc. (2) By creating, undesirable objects, actions, persons :
and incidents etc. A devotee, bears no ill-will, in the least, ns
to anyone, even though, they may act against his principles, :
become an obstacle to his progress and may harm him physically,
economically or mentally as he beholds his own favourite Deity,
abiding in them (Manasa 7/112 b). | -
Not only this, but he beholds and feels the gracious sweet
will of God, in the actions of those, who bear ill-will to him. _
Every being (soul), is a fragment of God. So if a striver,
bears ill-will to any being, it means that he bears, ill-will to -
God. Such a person bearing ill-will, to anyone can neither be
identified with God, nor can he have exclusive devotion to Him.
When a devotee becomes totally free, from ill-will, he can be
fully devoted, to God. Therefore, a devotee is free from malice, -
for each and every being.
'Maitrah karuna eva ca'*—A devotee, is not only free from
malice, for every being but he is also friendly and compassionate,
to all beings, because he beholds that all beings are His
manifestations. ""The Lord, is a disinterested friend of all
beings' (Gita 5/29), (Srimadbhagavata 3/25/21). The Lord's
* The marks of a devotee described here are greater in number and
also more singular than the marks of the liberated soul who has attained
perfection by transcending the modes of nature (Gita 14/22—25), ""Maitrah'
(friendly) and 'Karunah’ (compassionate) these words have been used only
here, not there.
"
1444,"Verse 13-14] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1389 -
nature, descends on His devotees and therefore, he is friendly
and compassionate to all beings, without any selfish motive
(Manasa 7/47/3). -
He is friendly, even to those who harm him, because he holds,
that whatever is done, is meant for his welfare, by the sweet will
of God. Moreover, he thinks that those who are harming him,
deserve special respect, because they are destroying his past sin, :
by becoming an instrument.
Every striver, thinks and he should also think, that those who
are doing wrong or those who harm him, are purifying him of ee
the sins of the past. When even a common striver, is friendly -
and compassionate, to those who bear ill-will to him, a devotee
who has attained perfection must be very much more friendly
and compassionate, to them. _
In the ‘Patanjalayogadarsana’, four factors have been
mentioned, to purify the mind.
‘Friendship, to those who are happy, compassion to those, - |
who are sad, a feeling of pleasure to those, who are virtuous,
and indifference to those, who are sinners’ (1/33). :
But here Lord Krsna, has included the four factors in
two—friendship and compassion. It means, that a perfect devotee
is friendly to the happy and the virtuous, and compassionate, to ;
the sad and the sinful.
A striver, instead of being indifferent to a sinner should be
compassionate to him, because the striver, who is suffering is
being purified of his old sins by reaping fruit of his sinful actions
of the past, while the sinner, who is inflicting pain on a striver,
is committing a new sin. So, he specially deserves, compassion.
'Nirmamah'—Though a devotee is naturally friendly and
compassionate to all beings, yet he has no sense of mine, with
anyone. It is mineness with beings, and objects, which binds
him. He is totally free from a sense of mine, even with his
"
1445,"1390 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12 |
so-called body, senses, mind, and intellect. A striver, commits

an error that he tries to be free from mineness with beings and
objects, but he does not pay proper attention to the point, that -
he has to be free from mineness, with his body, mind, intellect :
and senses, also.

""'Nirahankarah'—A person, has egoistic feelings by identifying,
the self with the body and senses etc. If a devotee, has no
egoism, but he realizes his true affinity for God, noble, divine
and unique traits, are revealed in him. But he, knowing those
traits (virtues) as divine, regards them as of God, not of his own. ee
So, he becomes free from egoism. 7

‘Samaduhkhasukhah'—A devotee, remains even-minded in
pleasure and pain, favourable and unfavourable circumstances,
without having attachment and aversion, for them. _

Favourable and unfavourable circumstances, by making a
man happy and sad, bind him. A devotee, knows of favourable
and the unfavourable circumstances, but he remains even-minded, -
he feels neither happy nor sad.

'Ksami'—The Lord, in the thirteenth verse of this chapter, -
by the term 'Advesta’, declared that His devotee does not bear
any malice, towards those people who bear animosity, with him.
Here, by the term 'Ksamr’, the Lord says that he is forgiving even -
to those, who do wrong to him without having the least desire, -
to punish them. He wants them not to be punished by God or
anyone else, for the wrong done to him. This is an excellence
of a devotee.

‘Santustah satatam'*—Generally, a being, is content in .
favourable circumstances, but he loses his calm, in undesirable
circumstances. This contentment is not eternal, because he wants
to derive satisfaction out of perishable persons and objects etc. He

_* In the Bhagavata there is description of such a man who is ever
content. As a person wearing shoes has no fear of pebbles and thorns, so is a
man, who is content ever and everywhere, happy without any trace of sadness.
"
1446,"Verse 13-14] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1391 .
(the self), being eternal can attain real and permanent contentment,
only by realizing God, Who is eternal. :

Having realized God, a devotee ever remains content, because -
he has neither disunion from Him, nor does he need the perishable |
world. Therefore, there is no reason for his discontent. It is
because of contentment, that he does not attach importance, to |
any mundane being or object, in the least.*

The term ‘Satatam’, with the term ‘Santustah’ shows, that
a devotee ever remains content and that contentment never .
undergoes any change, nor is there any possibility, of any change oe
in it. A perfect soul, always remains content, whether he has -
attained perfection through the paths of action, or knowledge
or devotion. | |

'Yogi'—Here the term 'YogT, stands for a devotee, who has -
realized God (who ever remains united with Him), through the
path of devotion.

In fact, no person can ever be disunited from God. He, who
has realized this fact, is a Yog!.

""'Y atatma'—He, who has fully controlled his body, including :
the mind, intellect and senses, is ""Yatatma'’. A God-realized devotee
has not to control his mind, and intellect etc. These are naturally,
under his control. So, in him there is no possibility of any evil, -
born of contact of senses, with sense-objects. In fact, the mind,
intellect and senses should follow a right path. But, these deviate
from the right path, because a person is attached, to the world.

A devotee's mind, intellect and senses, remain under his control,
because he is not in the least, attached to the world, and so his :
actions are exemplary.

The senses of virtuous and righteous persons, never deviate

* Saint Kabira declares:—

All the riches in the form of cows, elephants, horses and jewels
stand nowhere before the wealth of contentment.
"
1447,"1392 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12 |

from the right path. King Dusyanta got attached towards
Sakuntala; so he had full confidence that she must belong to a
Ksatriya family, rather than a Brahmana. According to the poet -
Kalidasa, in case of doubt, the inclination of a virtuous person,
is testimony of the right path (Abhijfiana Sakuntalam 1/21).

How can, the mind, intellect and senses of a perfect devotee,
deviate from the right path, when the snses of even, a righteous |
person do not deviate?

'Drdhaniscayah'—An enlightened soul, has a firm determination |
that the world has no independent existence, while God never Oe
ceases to be, and his affinity for Him is eternal. An ignorant -
person, considers the world as real, and attaches importance to
it, while a perfect devotee, does not believe in the existence of
the world, for him only, God exists. _

In that firm determination, only existence of God, remains.
Actually this determination is not of the intellect, it is of the
self. But it is reflected, in-the intellect. -

Conceding the independent existence of the world and
assuming affinity with it, doubt and contrary feeling arise in
the intellect. Such intellect never becomes steady. The intellect,
of a perfect soul remains without any doubt, while that of the
ignorant remains, doubtful. The intellect of the ignorant, attaches ,
value to the world and accepts its existence. But the intellect of -
a perfect soul does not accept existence of anything else, except
God. His intellect is totally free from doubt and contrary feeling,
and is steadfast, in God only.

'Mayyarpitamanobuddhih'—When a striver resolves, that
he has to realize God only, and he becomes God's (which he
really is), his mind and intellect, are naturally dedicated to Him.

Then, why should the mind and intellect of a perfect devotee,
not remain dedicated to Him?

Naturally, a person's mind, is fixed on the object or person
he loves, and his intellect is fixed, in the object or person he |
"
1448,"Verse 13-14] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI : 1393
considers, the best. For a devotee none is more loving and
better, than God. So his mind and intellect are naturally,
dedicated to Him. | .
'Yah madbhaktah sa me priyah'*—God loves all, but a devotee |
loves only God. So according to His promise, ""As men approach
Me, so do I accept them” (Gita 4/11), He loves devotees. |
Appendix—In the Gita the marks of a Karmayogi have been
stated (2/55—72, 6/7—9), the marks of a Jnanayogi have been
stated (14/22—25) and the marks of a devotee have been stated
(12/13—-19). But while stating the marks of a devotee, the Lord So
has declared—‘advesta sarvabhitanarmh maitrah karuna eva ca’. -
The marks ‘friendly’ and ‘compassionate’ have been mentioned
only in a devotee, not in a Karmayogi nor in a Jnanayogi. A
Karmayogi and a Jnanayogi are equanimous but are not friendly _
and compassionate. But a devotee possesses the feelings of
friendship and compassion from the beginning.
A devotee holds that all beings, being the fragments of -
entire-God, are none but God, then who should be at enmity,
with whom should he be at enmity and why should he be at -
enmity?—‘niyja prabhumaya dekhahim jagata kehi sana karahim
birodha’ (Manasa, Uttara. 112-b). For example a devotee loves
Rama, another Krsna and the third one Siva. In spite of their
deities being different they can have oneness among themselves -
but all Jnanayogis can never be so. If a devotee and a Jnanayog1
happen to meet each other, the devotee will pay more respect
to the Jnanayog: than the Jnanayogi will pay to the devotee.
Therefore the mark of devotees has been mentioned—‘sabahi |
manaprada apu amani’ (Manasa, Uttara. 38/2).
* Lord Rama declares that the entire universe is equally loved by Him
because it has been created by Him. But those who having renounced their
egoism and hypocrisy adore Him with mind, speech and action, they may be
men, women or impotent persons are most loving to Him (Manasa, Uttara.
87/4, 87 A).
"
1449,"1394 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA - [Chapter 12
At the beginning of the Ramacaritamanasa, Goswami
Tulasidasaji Maharaja does obeisance to the wicked persons
besides the gentle ones and does it with sincere feelings—‘bahuri _
bandi khala gana satibhaerh’ (Manasa, Bala. 4/1). Only a devotee .
can do so, a Jnanayogi can’t. Though a Jnanayogi does not bear
malice to anyone in the least, yet naturally he remains indifferent
and neutral. In the path of discrimination (knowledge), there |
is predominance of detachment (Vairagya) and ‘Vairagya’
(renunciation) is dry. Therefore though a Jiianayogi is not hard
hearted, yet he seems hard hearted outwardly because of his |
dispassionate and indifferent nature. ee
He who takes joy from others is hard at heart and he who
gives joy to others, is soft at heart. A Jnanayog! rejoices having
attained salvation, so he remains hard at heart. But a devotee _
has the notion to give joy to others from the beginning, so he is
soft at heart. A devotee bears no malice even to the enemy. A
Jnanayog! is like father and a devotee is like mother, therefore an
a devotee is more compassionate than a Jnanayogi. |
‘Eva’—This term means that a devotee is devoid of -
malice—not only this but he is friendly and compassionate
also to others. : : ,
‘Nirmamo nirahankarah’—It is inevitable for every striver
to be free from the sense of mine and egoism; therefore in -
the Gita the Lord, in Karmayoga, Jnanayoga and Bhaktiyoga—all
the three, has mentioned the strivers to be free from them—
in Karmayoga ‘nirmamo nirahankarah sa santimadhigacchati’
(2/71), in Jnanayoga ‘ahankaram........vimucya nirmamah Santo .
brahmabhtyaya kalpate’ (18/53) and in Bhakttyoga ‘nirmamo
nirahankarah sama duhkha sukhah ksami’ (12/13). In this
connection, a point needs special attention that in fact the self
is free from the sense of mine and egoism. Egoism (I’ness) and
sense of possession (mineness)—both are assumed in the Self,
they are not real. Had they been real, we could have never been
"
1450,"Verse 13-14] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1395 |
free from the sense of mine and egoism and the Lord would
have also not ordered Arjuna to be free from the sense of mine
and egoism. But we can be free from the sense of mine and |
egoism, therefore the Lord states so. -
In Karmayoga, first ‘desire’ is renounced, then a |
Karmayog! naturally becomes free from the ‘sense of mine’ and |
‘egoism’ (Gita 2/71). In Jnanayoga, first ‘egoism’ is renounced, |
then a Jnanayog! naturally becomes free from the ‘sense of mine’
(Gita 18/53). In Bhaktiyoga, a devotee dedicates himself to God,
then by God’s grace, he naturally is freed from the ‘sense of |
mine’ and ‘egoism’. | OO
“Mayyarpitamano buddhiryo madbhaktah sa me priyah’—Here 7
the expression ‘mayyarpitamano buddhih’ stands for the person
who has dedicated himself to God. When the self in dedicated, -
then mind and intellect are naturally dedicated. When the self is
dedicated, then mind and intellect are naturally dedicated. When
the self is dedicated, then nothing remains at all. The reason is that - ,
the self is primary (viz., of the first importance) while the body,
mind and intellect etc., are of secondary importance. A devotee
is a devotee first while as a human being he is second. When
a devotee dedicates himself to God, his mind and intellect are
also dedicated and then mind and intellect lose their independent ;
existence but only God remains. 7 _
God is equally related with both prakrtis—‘para’ and ‘apara’
but the self (para) is not related with ‘apara’. The reason is
that the self is superior to ‘apara prakrti’ and is a fragment of
God. Therefore the self has affinity with God. The expression
‘mayyarpitamanobuddhih’ means that the self should not .
assume the ‘apara prakrti’ (minds-intellect) as its own but should
assume God as-its own.*
God is knowledge-personified and is ever perfect in itself.
* Here within ‘mana’ (mind), ‘citta’ and within ‘buddhi’ (intellect),
‘aham’ (ego) should be included. ;
"
1451,"1396 $RIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12
Therefore He has no hunger (inquisitiveness) for knowledge, but
He has certainly a hunger for love. Therefore the Lord declares
that the devotee, who has dedicated his mind and intellect to -
Him, is loving to Him. No one else at all can be loving to God ;
besides such a devotoe.
Suppose a Prince being the son of the King begs alms
from others, it incurs displeasure of the king, similarly if the |
self, being a fragment of God and an embodiment of truth-
knowledge-bliss solidified, cherishes desire of receiving something
from the unreal, inert world, the abode of sorrows, it displeases ~
God, it is unpleasant to God because it is much harmful for ee
that being. Only the devotee, who entertains no such hope from
anyone else besides Him and which involves his great welfare,
is loving to Him— .
eka bani karunanidhana ki, so priya jakem gati na 4anakt.
_ (Manasa, Aranya. 10/4)
Link—In the second group, consisting of the next verse, the
Lord describes six marks of perfect (enlightened) devotees. ""
TAA gad et ciepralgstdt Ta: |

‘He by whom no being gets agitated and who is not agitated
by any being and who is free from joy, anger (envy), fear and
perturbation, he is dear to Me. 15 ;
Comment:— a
'Yasmannodvijate lokah'—A devotee beholds his most
loving Lord, everywhere and in all. Therefore, all the activities
undertaken by him, with his mind, speech and body are only,
to please God (Gita 6/31). Then, how can he agitate anyone? |
"
1452,"Verse 15] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1397
Even then, the life- story of devotees shows, that some people,
bear ill-will to them and oppose. them, without any reason merely
having heard their glory or action or sometimes even seeing his
gentle countenance. | — -

A devotee, never hurts anyone because he realizes, that all is
God (Gita 7/19). All his activities, are naturally for the welfare of
all beings. He does not annoy anyone even by an error. People
may get annoyed with him, because of their satanic nature. How,
can a devotee be blamed, for this satanic nature?

Bhartrhari declares—""Deer, fishes, and gentle persons live on oe
straw, water and contentment respectively; but hunters, fishermen -
and vile persons, are at enmity with them without any rhyme
or reason.” | , .

In fact, no person can be agitated by devotees. Even vile _
persons who bear envy for devotees, in the company of saints
by beholding and touching them, by talking to them and even
by thinking of them, abandon their hellish traits and become -
devotees. It is because of their generous nature, that even vile
persons renounce their evil nature, and become devotees. .

Lord Siva in the Manasa also declares, ""It is because of
virtue that a saint, returns good for evil"" (Manasa 5/41/4).

But, it is not a rule, that all persons who bear envy to
devotees, should be benefitted. oe | -

If it is believed that no one, is agitated by devotees, nor
does anyone act against them, nor have they, any enemy or
friend, how can it be said, these (as is said in the eighteenth
and nineteenth verses) that they are, alike to foe and friend, ;
honour and dishonour, praise and blame etc.? It means, that it
is because of their wicked nature, that vile people can be shaken
by virtuous actions of devotees, and can act against them and
regard them as their foes, while devotees do not regard anyone
as their enemy, nor do they upset anyone.

""Lokannodvijate ca yah'—A devotee, is also not agitated by
"
1453,"1398 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12 |
any being because of two factors—

(1) A devotee may have to face unfavourable circumstances,
but having known the reality and because of great devotion for
God, he remains so much engrossed in his devotion, that he |
beholds God, everywhere ‘in every being, object and action etc.

So he beholds the Lord's pastime only. Thus, he is not agitated
_ by any action.

(2) A man is agitated only when someone does anything
against his desire or belief etc. But as a devotee has no desire,
he is not at all excited. Cee

""Harsamarsabhayodvegairmukto yah sa ca me priyah'—When -
the Lord declares, that a perfect devotee is free from joy, He
means to say, that he remains free from evil or modifications,
such as Rajasika or Tamasika joy etc. But it does not mean, that -
he is free from joy but it means that his joy is eternal, uniform
and unique. His joy does not undergo any modification, when
he either acquires perishable mundane objects or loses them. He 7
ever feels happy, after beholding, God and His pastime.

A common man, is envious of other persons’ good fortune,
wealth, knowledge, glory and honour etc. Sometimes even
strivers are envious, of other strivers’ spiritual progress. But a
perfect devotee, is totally free from this evil, because for him
in the entire universe, there is no independent existence of any -
being, except of God.

If a striver, after thinking of the spiritual progress of other
strivers, thinks that he should also progress in the sameway, it
is useful for him. But, if he is envious of others’ progress, he
has a downfall.

A person, can be full of fear, because of two factors—

(i) External, such as a lion, a snake, a thief or a robber etc., and
anyother, worldly loss (ii) Internal reasons, such as the thought
and performance of evil and forbidden deeds, including theft,
falsehood, fraud and adultery etc.
"
1454,"Verse 15] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1399
A man, is in the greatest fear, of death. Even a wise man,
is generally, in fear of death. Sometimes, a striver is also afraid
of the fact that his body will become weak, by spiritual practice,
such as adoration and meditation etc., and how, he would be able
to maintain his body and look after the family, if he become
fully dispassionate. A common man, is afraid of a rival, who is |
stronger than he. A man, has to remain in fear of all of them,
because: he depends on matter (body etc.,). When he totally
depends on God's feet, he becomes free from fear, forever.
As an enlightened devotee always beholds the pastime of Be
his loving Lord, only, how can he be full of fear? | -
The Lord, has used the term 'Udvega' (agitation), three times
in the verse. No being is agitated by a devotee, he is not agitated by
any being. Thirdly, He has used this term, to show that a man may -
also be agitated in other cases, as he may not be able to complete
a piece of work, in spite of his best efforts, he may not be able to
reap, the fruit of action, there may occur undesirable incidents, -
such as earth-quake and flood etc. But, as far as a perfect devotee,
is concerned, he remains free from all such excitement. -
A man, is agitated because of his desire born of ignorance,
and his hellish nature. A devotee, has no desire, because he is
totally free from ignorance. As far as, his demoniac nature is
concerned, it perishes during the course of his spiritual practice. - .
As he has no independent will, and God's will is his will, he
ever remains pleased, in desirable, as well as, undesirable
circumstances, by thinking of God's grace, in them. So, there
is a total lack of agitation in him.
An enlightened devotee, remains free from agitation, joy,
envy and fear etc., because, from his view-point they have no
independent existence, except of God. He does not attach any
importance to these, and so he is not affected by them.
When a person, is proud of his virtues, it means that he
has inculcated an evil propensity of pride, while a divine trait |
"
1455,"1400 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12 |
can never give birth, to a demoniac trait, because ""the divine
nature is deemed conducive to liberation"" (Gita 16/5). So, in this
verse, the term 'Muktah’ (liberated or free) instead of 'Bhaktah'
(devotee), has been used because a devotee, ever remains free +
from all evils. The evil, of pride gives birth to several other
evils, as all evils depend, on the evil of pride.
An enlightened devotee, does not even know, that he possesses
any virtue. If he finds any virtues appearing in him, he regards it
as God's, not, as his. Thus, having no pride of virtue, a devotee
remains free, from all evils. God is loving to devotees, therefore oe
devotees, are loving to God (Gita 7/17). | -
, Appendix—When a man cognises existence of any other
entity besides God, then agitation, envy and fear etc., emanate.
From the view-point of a devotee, there is no other existence _
besides God, then whom should he agitate, envy and frighten
and why ?—‘nija prabhumaya dekhahith jagata kehi sana karahirh

the Lord describes six marks of, perfect devotees.

| He, who has no expectation, is internally and externally pure, -
skilful, unconcerned and untroubled, renouncing all new action for
pleasure and prosperity, he, My devotee is dear to Me. 16
Comment:—
‘Anapeksah'—A devotee, considers God the noblest. He thinks
that there is no greater gain, than God-realization. So, he is not
in the least, attracted towards any worldly object. He is not
"
1456,"Verse 16] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 1401 -
even attached to his so-called body, senses, mind and intellect,
because he regards these as God's, as they really belong to Him.
He is not even worried, how he will maintain his body. He is,
totally free from desires. .
A devotee, is not shaken even by the greatest sorrow,
because he remains absorbed in the Lord's pastime, even in
most unfavourable circumstances. He, does not desire favourable
circumstances, of any kind.
Such a devotee, knows that all mundane objects are perishable,
while he (the self), can never be separated from God: Having BS
known this reality, he has no desire to acquire, these perishable -
objects.
It is not a rule, that by mere desire a man, can get necessary
material for maintenance of life, and without having desire, he _
does not. He naturally, acquires necessary objects to maintain
his body, because arrangement for necessary materials for the
maintenance of the body, has already been made, by God. If he :
has keen desire to acquire any mundane objects, he creates an
obstacle to the acquisition of objects, as desire does not spread -
and go to others. So, other people, are not inspired to offer such
objects to him. It is generally seen, that no one wants to offer
any object to those (thieves etc.,) who have a keen desire to
acquire these. On the other hand, people want to offer objects :
to dispassionate ascetics and innocent children etc., who do not
desire them. Arrangements are made, happily by others, for the
maintenance of their bodies. It proves, that necessities of life are
provided for those, who have no desire for them. Therefore, it |
is nothing but a folly, to desire required objects, because desire |
is an invitation to suffering. An enlightened devotee, does not
even expect to maintain his body.
Some devout devotees, do not even desire, to behold God.
They totally depend upon His sweet will and remain absorbed
in Him, by thinking of His boundless grace. The Lord, follows
"
1457,"1402 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12 -
such devotees, so that the dust of their feet may touch Him so
that He may be sanctified (Srimadbha. 11/14/16).

A devotee, who adores God, to reap the fruit of devotion
in the form of worldly objects, is really a devotee to the .
objects, rather than to God, as he desires objects, rather than
God. But, He is so generous, that He accepts him as His devotee
(Gita 7/16), because he wants his desire to be fulfilled, by Him
only. The Lord, shows not only this favour, but also changes
seekers of wealth, such as Dhruva, into men of wisdom, having
fulfilled their desire. ee

'Sucih'—The body of a devotee, becomes very much pure, -
because he has neither egoism nor a sense of ‘mine’. His mind
also, becomes very pure, because his mind is free from attachment |
and aversion, pleasure and pain, desire and wrath and such other 7
evils. Such a devotee, because of his external and internal purity,
sanctifies other people who behold him, touch him, talk to him
and think of him. Places of pilgrimage, sanctify all people, while -
devotees provide pilgrimage to those places, which places, are
sanctified by a touch of their feet (but devotees are not proud of
it). Such devotees, sanctify even the pure and they move from
one place of pilgrimage to another, by making these as great
places of pilgrimage (Srimadbhagavata 1/13/ 10).

King Bhagiratha, says to Ganges:—""O mother, those who :
have renounced all mundane and spiritual desires, who having a
disinclination; for the world, are calm in themselves, are devoted
to Brahma (the Absolute), and purify the worlds, such saintly |
souls, will destroy all sins with their touch, because God Who .
destroys all sins, resides in their hearts.""

""Daksah'—'Daksah’ (clever) 1s he, who has attained the
aim of this human life i.e., God-realization. The Lord, in the
Srimadbhagavata declares, ""The limit of the wisdom of the wise
and the skill of the skilful, consists in attaining the Imperishable
and the Real, through this perishable and unreal, body"" (12/29/22).
"
1458,"Verse 16] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1403 -

In fact, worldly skill is not real skill, it is a kind of a blot
because it induces a man, to attach more importance to matter,
which leads him to a downfall.

An enlightened devotee, is also skilful in mundane affairs. But,
it is an insult to him if his skill in mundane affairs, is regarded .
as a touchstone of his progress, in the. spiritual sphere.

'Udasinah'—An enlightened devotee, remains indifferent, to
whatever happens. He remains detached from all incidents and
circumstances etc., in the same way, as a man standing on the
top of a high mountain, is unaffected by fire or flood, on the :
earth. He remains alike, to a friend and a foe, from his heart So
though his dealings, outwardly may seem different. He is ever
impartial, because he regards the entire universe including the
body, as God's.

'Gatavyathah'—He remains, free from affliction and
worries. He is not troubled by favourable and unfavourable
circumstances, attachment and aversion, pleasure and pain and :
such other, evils.

‘Sarvarambhaparityagi'—Performance of new _ actions .
for pleasure and prosperity, is known as 'Arambha’, such as
accumulation of new articles and starting new business etc., to
hoard money. A devotee, renounces all initiative in action, for
pleasure and prosperity etc.

A person, who hankers after worldly pleasure and prosperity,
and who is proud of himself because of his caste, creed, order of
life, learning, intellect, ability, position and authority etc., is not a
devotee. A devotee, is he who is devoted to God. He surrenders .
his body, senses, mind, intellect, actions and their rewards etc., to
God, because He is their real owner. He regards prakrti (Nature)
and its evolute, as God's. Therefore, a devotee regards no one
else, except God, as his. He, instead of performing actions for
himself, performs these to please, God. He never performs action
to gain wealth or property, comfort or luxury, honour or praise
"
1459,"1404 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12 -
etc. He does not perform any action, for pleasure or prosperity,
because he has a true desire for God-realization.

""Yo madbhaktah sa me priyah'—The Lord, has so much .of
attraction, that a devotee is automatically attracted towards Him,
and he becomes devoted to Him.

""The sages, who are satisfied in the self, and who out of
wisdom, have renounced their affinity for matter (insentient), adore
God, without expecting any reward, because He possesses such
virtues which attract people, towards Him"" (Srimadbhia. 1/7/10).

Now a question can arise, as to why all persons are not Be
attracted towards God and become devoted to Him, if He has -
so much of attraction. :

In fact, a person (the self) is naturally attracted, towards Him,
because he is His fragment. But, it is because of his attachment _
to the body, senses, mind, intellect, family and worldly objects
etc., that he has a disinclination for God, Whose fragment he is.

God pervades everywhere, but He is not revealed to man, because -
of his attachment to sense-objects i.e., mundane pleasures. When

a man, renounces his attachment to perishable pleasures, he is .
naturally attracted towards God, and becomes devoted to Him.

The Lord, calls such a devotee who has an exclusive devotion

to Him 'Madbhaktah’, and he is loving to Him.

Appendix—‘Anapeksah’—A devotee has no expectation even
for the so-called necessities of life. A devotee holds that ‘AII is
God’ and than what should he expect? ‘Suci’—Even the vision,
touch and the discourse of a devotee saint sanctifies others. Even
the wind by contact with his body becomes pure. |

Though a Jnanayogi, an exalted soul also possesses such .
purity, yet a devotee remains specially obsessed in the welfare
(because of his friendly and compassionate nature) of all beings
from the very beginning, so he is specially pure (holy). ‘Daksa’—A
devotee 1s wise because he has achieved the aim of human life
viz., for him nothing remains to be done, nothing remains to be
"
1460,"Verse 17] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1405 | -
known and nothing remains to be attained. :

‘Sarvarambha parityagi—This expression has also been
used, for the person who has transcended the three gunas, in
the twenty-fifth verse of the fourteenth chapter ‘sarvarambha
parityagi gunatitah sa ucyate’. An exalted soul who has transcended ,
the three gunas, being free from the sense of doership, is
‘sarvarambhaparityagr viz., he abandons all new undertakings
for pleasure and prosperity. For a devotee nothing remains to
be done at all for himself, then what activity should he do? He
may undertake an activity but he remains free from attachment, .
desire for its fruit and any insistence on its doing etc., it may Se sm
be undertaken or not, it does not make any difference to him. -
He remains equanimous in both the states.

next verse, mentions the five marks of a perfect devotee.

Subhasubhaparityagi bhaktimanyah sa me priyah

He, who neither rejoices nor hates, neither grieves nor desires, |
and who has renounced attachment and aversion in good and evil,
deeds, he who is thus devoted, is dear to Me. 17 :

Comment:— :

'Yo na hrsyati na dvesti na gocati na kanksati'—There are |
four important demerits—(1) attachment, (2) aversion (hate),
(3) rejoicing and (4) grief. An enlightened devotee, is free from
these four evils. He realizes that the world, being perishable has
no independent existence. He (the self), being a fragment of God,
is imperishable. So, he instead of having his affinity, for the
changing world, accepts his affinity for God, which is eternal.
"
1461,"1406 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter12  —
Thus, his mind is totally free from such evils, as attachment
and aversion etc.
During spiritual practice, the more one advances towards
| spiritualism, the less attachment and aversion, he has. When he |
attains perfection, these evils perish totally. |
- A common man, rejoices when he acquires desirable objects
and gets rid of undesirable ones, while he grieves when he gets
undesirable objects or is likely to get them, or loses desirable
ones. An enlightened devotee, remains even-minded and free
_ from evils, such as attachment and aversion etc. ee
At night, in the dark, a person wishes to light a lamp and = -
he feels happy having lighted it. He hates a person or becomes
angry with him, who extinguishes the light, and is worried :
as to how to light it again. But, at noon, when the sun shines
. brightly, he has neither a desire to light the lamp, or is rejoiced
_ having lighted it, nor is angry with a man, who extinguishes it
nor is worried how to light it again. Similarly, when a man has -
a disinclination for God and inclination for the world he desires
favourable circumstances, to maintain his body etc., he is rejoiced
having acquired these, hates those or is angry with those, who
are an obstacle to their acquisition and is worried how to acquire
them again if these are not acquired. But, he who (like the sun
at noon) has attained perfection, becomes free from these evils. |
_ He has no desire at all, and so he has no need for the world.
‘Subhaéubhaparityagi'—All actions, of a devotee, change into
inaction, because he is free from a sense of mine, attachment, and
desire for fruit. So, his good actions, also change into inaction. |
Evil actions, are not performed by him, because he is totally /
free, from attachment, aversion and desire etc., which influence
a man to perform evil actions. .
: _ He is neither attached to good actions, nor has an aversion
for evil ones. Only virtuous actions, prescribed by scriptures
are performed, by him while forbidden actions, are renounced
"
1462,"Verse 18] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1407 7
by him, without having any attachment or aversion for them. A

real renouncer, is he who has totally renounced attachment and

aversion for them.

It is not actions, but attachment and aversion, which bind a
man. As a perfect devotee, is free from attachment and aversion, °
he is said to have renounced good and evil deeds.

It may also mean, he is a renouncer of the fruit of good
and evil, actions. But this idea has already been expressed in
the first half of this verse, when the Lord declares, ""He neither
rejoices nor hates, neither grieves nor desires."" If this meaning .
is taken, then there is a repetition, of the same idea. Therefore, Sa
here it should mean, renouncement of attachment and aversion ~
for good and evil actions.

‘Bhaktimanyah sa me priyah'—A devotee loves God, very
much and so he naturally thinks of Him, remembers Him and -
adores Him. Such a devotee has been called a ‘Bhaktiman’ (full
of devotion).

A devotee, has an exclusive devotion for God, therefore he
is loved by Him.

Appendix—Joy (hrsyati) and grief (Socati), attachment -
(kanksati) and aversion (dvesti)—these are dualities (pairs of
opposites). A devotee remains free from these dualities. In “Narada
bhaktisutra’ it is mentioned—‘yatprapya na kificidvanchati na
Socati na dvesti na ramate notsahi bhavati’ (5). |

“Having attained devotion, a devotee neither desires anything
nor grieves nor hates nor is attached to anything and having
obtained a thing, he is not encouraged (rejoiced).’ ,

Comment:— -
- ‘Samah Satrau ca mitre ca'—Being free from attachment
and aversion, a perfect devotee, is even-minded, towards foe
and friend, equally. Not to talk of common men, even strivers, -
are swayed by feelings of enmity and friendship, towards an
enlightened devotee. But, he ever remains even-minded, to foe
and friend. |
_ If there is a quarrel between two persons, over division of
property, one of them has a feeling of enmity, towards a devotee,
while the second person has a feeling of friendship, for him. In
sitting Over judgment, a devotee, will allow a little more, to the
former and a bit less, to the latter. It seems, that the judgment of
the devotee is not just, but the former will feel, that the judgment |
is right. Such a judgment, will create a feeling of equanimity, |
even in the person who regards the devotee, as his enemy.
An enlightened devotee, is alike to foe and friend. It means,
that people regard him, as a foe or a friend. So he has in reality
not been without foe and friend, but he has been called to be
alike, to both of them.
"
1464,"Verse 19] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1409 |

'Tathad manapamanayoh'—A man, feels honoured or
dishonoured, when he identifies the self with body. A devotee,
has neither egoistic feelings, with his body nor a sense of mine.
So, if his body is honoured or dishonoured, his mind, does not |
undergo any modification (happiness or sadness). He always
remains established, in equanimity. ,

'Sitosnasukhaduhkhesu samah'—An enlightened devotee's
equanimity, has been described here, in the two pairs of
opposites—

(1) He is equanimous in cold and heat Le., there is no a
modification in his mind, even when there is contact of the -
senses, with sense-objects.

(2) He has equanimity, in pleasure and pain, i.e., his mind
remains the same in gain and loss, of riches and materials etc. _

'Sitosna', stands for cold and heat i.e., a sense of touch
only, but here it stands for all other senses also. When senses,
are in contact with their sense-objects, a perfect devotee, knows -
of favourable and unfavourable circumstances, but he remains
equanimous, while a common man feels happy or sad, and has
an attachment and aversion for those circumstances.

In the Git, 'to remain even in pleasure and pain' and 'to be
devoid of pleasure and pain’ both, are used in the same sense.

The favourable (happy) and unfavourable (sad) circumstances,
are inevitable. So, it is not possible to be devoid of them, but
an enlightened devotee, remains the same (even) without feeling,
either happy or sad. One can be devoid of pleasure and pain,
which arise from favourable and unfavourable circumstances. |
In the Gita, where there is mention of being even in pleasure
and pain, it means, that one is equable, in favourable and
unfavourable circumstances. And, where there is mention of
absence of pleasure and pain, it means pleasure and pain, arising
from these circumstances.
‘Sangavivarjitah'—The term 'Sanga’, means, both affinity
"
1465,"1410 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter12
(union) and attachment. It is not possible for a person, to be
disunited physically, from the body, mind, senses and intellect,
so long as, he remains alive. He can physically renounce,
objects other than the body. But real renouncement, consists __
in renouncing attachment for objects and beings, rather than
their physical renouncement. Had physical renouncement, led a
person to salvation, every person after death, would have attained
salvation, as he abandons even his body. If he is attached to
beings and objects etc., even after death, he is in bondage,
because it is attachment, rather than physical renouncement,
which leads to bondage. —
Physical renouncement, can also be a means, to renounce
attachment, but attachment, should be renounced from the
heart. If there is the least attachment to the world, a person, _
will certainly think of it. Then attachment, will give birth to
desire, anger and delusion respectively, and may lead him to
ruin (Gita 2/62-63). -
The Lord, in the fifty-ninth verse of the second chapter, by
using the expression ‘Pararh drstva nivartate’, declared, ""Even
the taste for the objects of sense, turns away when the Supreme
is seen."" It means that attachment 1s totally renounced, after
God-realization. But, it does not mean that attachment, cannot
be totally renounced, during spiritual practice. When the soul 7
of a striver, is no longer attached to external contacts (objects),
even during spiritual practice, he immediately attains undying
bliss or God-realization (Gita 5/21; 16/22). |
Attachment, abides neither in the soul (self), which is a .
pure sentient fragment of God, nor in matter (prakrti). It retains
in the ego, of the embodied soul, and it seems to reside in the
mind, intellect, senses and sense-objects. When a striver, ceases
to identify himself with body and has no attachment for it, his
attachment for objects etc., will totally perish. This attachment,
originates out of ignorance (lack of discrimination). A man, is
"
1466,"Verse 19} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1411
attached to persons, and objects etc., because, he does not attach
importance to, discrimination. A perfect devotee, has no ignorance, |
therefore he is totally free, from attachment.
A person, by an error having a disinclination for God, Whose
fragment he (the self) is, is attached to the world, by regarding it.
as, his. When this assumed affinity, for the world is renounced,
he becomes, even-minded. This even-mindedness, naturally leads |
him to, detachment. | | :
In fact a being, has a natural inclination (devotion) to God. oT a
But, because of his assumed affinity with the world, this inclination
(love) to God, is not revealed. This inclination for the Lord, |
appears as attachment, for the world. In spite of this attachment, . |
to the world, love towards God, is not totally, effaced. But, as oe
soon as a striver, is inclined towards Him, this attachment for
the world, perishes in the same way as darkness disappears with -
sun-rise. Similarly, the more he is detached from the world, | .
the more, he is inclined to God. After rooting out, attachment,
detachment, also perishes, in the same way as fire also perishes |
after having burnt pieces of wood. With the disappearance of
attachment and detachment, there is natural and effortless flow
of devotion, to God. Then, the devotee surrenders himself to
God, and all his actions aré performed, in order to please Him. /
Being pleased with him, God offers love (devotion) to him. The
devotee, offers devotion, again to God. It pleases the Lord much,
and He again offers love (devotion), to him. Again, the devotee
returns it, to Him. In this way, this pastime of give and take, of
ever-enhancing love, goes on.
Tulyanindastutih'—Praise or censure, is generally concerned,
with one’s name. This is, done by others. People praise or blame,
a devotee by his name. A devotee, has neither egoistic feelings,
nor a feeling of 'mine, in his name and body. So he remains
"
1467,"1412 : SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter12  -
totally unaffected, by praise or blame. He has neither attachment
for a person, who praises him nor aversion for a person, who
blames him. Co

_. Common people, feel elated by praise or pained by blame,
while strivers, blush from praise, and become cautious by blame.
But an enlightened devotee, remains equanimous, in praise and
blame, though for the good of others sometimes, he may behave, __
like strivers, blushing on hearing praise and being cautious on ~
being blamed.

A devotee, beholds God, everywhere. So he remains unaffected
by praise and blame, and does not make any distinction, between - |
those who praise him and those who blame him. Moreover, he
does not perform forbidden (evil) actions, and as far as, good
actions are concerned, he thinks that it is He, Who was making
him an instrument, performs them. So he remains even-minded, _
in praise and blame.

Mauni—An enlightened devotee, is called ""Maunr' (thoughtful), —-
because he naturally thinks of God. He beholds God, in every
thought that comes to his mind (Gita 7/19). He constantly thinks —_
of Him, only. ,
Here the term ‘Maunr (silent), cannot be taken for a person,
who is restrained in speech, because by doing so, devotees who
propagate devotion, and divine discourse, through speech, will
not be called, devotees. Moreover, if silence (restraint in speech)
had made a person a devotee, it would have been very easy,
for anyone to become a devotee, merely by becoming silent
and there would have been innumerable devotees, though only
a few devotees exist. Besides, even a hypocrite, can remain
silent. So, here the term 'Mauni, stands for an enlightened soul,
who thinks of God. .

_ ‘Santusto yena kenacit'—Other people, hold that a devotee is
content, with bare means of bodily maintenance, but in fact, he
is not content with mundane objects and circumstances. He is
"
1468,"Verse 19] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1413 .
content constantly, as he remains engrossed, in devotion to God.
So, he remains even-minded, in favourable and unfavourable
circumstances, by regarding these as happenings of His
sweet will. | :

'Aniketah'— Aniketah’, is not he who is homeless, but one
who is not attached, to a fixed abode, whether he is a householder,
or an ascetic. A devotee, is not at all attached to his dwelling
place, to his body (gross, subtle and causal), and has not the
least, sense of mine, with these.

'Sthiramatih'—A devotee, has neither any doubt nor contrary Soc cee
feeling, about the existence and form of God. He remains firm in -
mind, about it without any proof, such as scriptures etc., because,
he always naturally remains engrossed in Him.

Desires, are stumbling blocks of steady-mindedness -
(Gita 2/44). Therefore, when a man completely casts off desires,
he is called, 'steady in mind’ (Gita 2/55). When a person, has -
desire to derive pleasure, out of contact of senses with sense-
objects, he is attached to the world. This attachment, to the ;
world is not renounced, even by regarding the world, as unreal
in the same way, as a person gets attached to cmema, even by
regarding the scene (persons and objects) as unreal or fake, or
he is reminded of old scenes, by thinking of them, though he |
knows that they do not exist, at that time. Therefore, so long
as a man has desires, from the heart for worldly pleasures, his
worldly attachment, cannot be renounced, even by considering
the world false or fake. Attachment, strengthens the independent |
existence of the world. When desire for mundane pleasures, 1s
renounced, attachment for the world automatically perishes, and
then the independent existence of the world, ceases to be, and
the mind gets fixed on God.

'Bhaktimanme priyo narah'—In the term 'Bhaktiman’, there is
suffix 'Matup', in the word 'Bhakti', which shows that a person,
"
1469,"1414 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA | [Chapter 12
naturally has devotion (love for God). But he commits an error
that instead of having devotion to God, he develops devotion
for the world. So he cannot relish devotion for God, and his .
life becomes dull and insipid. An enlightened devotee, ever |
remains engrossed in sentiments of devotion. So he is called
Bhaktiman (full of devotion). Such a man, full of devotion, is
loving to Him.
The Lord, by the term ‘Narah’, means that, only he who
has attained the aim of his life by realizing God, deserves to be |
called a ‘Narah' (man). He, who hankers after mundane pleasure eens
and prosperity, does not deserve, to be called a man. -
[In these two verses, there is description of a perfect devotee, |
who remains established in equanimity, in the five pairs of
opposites such as friend and foe, honour and dishonour, cold and -
heat, pleasure and pain, praise and blame. When a striver, attains
equanimity in these five pairs, he attains total equanimity. ] _
The Lord, in this topic from the thirteenth verse to the
nineteenth verse, by using the expression 'Me priyah' (loving to
Me), four times and 'Priyo narah' (that man is loving to Me) the |
fifth time, divided the topic of marks of his enlightened devotees, .
into five groups—the first group, consisting of the thirteenth and
the fourteenth verses, the second group, consisting of the fifteenth
verse, the third group, of the sixteenth verse, the fourth group,
of the seventeenth verse, and the fifth and last group, of the ;
eighteenth and the nineteenth verses. It means, that there are five
different groups of signs of enlightened devotees, rather than one,
otherwise the Lord might not have repeated the expression, 'Me
priyah,. (loving to Me), four times and 'Priyo narah’, the fifth time.
All groups of these signs of enlightened devotees,
include the absence of attachment and aversion, pleasure and
"
1470,"Verse 19] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1415 =
pain. In the first group, the terms ‘Nirmamah' and 'Advesta’
respectively, stand for freedom from attachment and aversion,

while the expression ‘Samaduhkhasukhah’ stands for freedom

from (balanced in), pleasure and pain. In the second group, ,
the expression ‘'Harsamarsabha-yodvegaih', stands for freedom

from attachment and aversion, pleasure and pain. In the third

group, the term 'Anapeksah' stands for freedom from attachment,

the term ‘Udasinah’ stands, for freedom from aversion while
‘'Gatavyathah' stands for freedom from pleasure and pain. In |
the fourth group, the expressions 'Na kanksati', 'Na dvesti', 'Na So
hrsyati' and 'Na Socati’ respectively, stand for, freedom from -
attachment, aversion, pleasure and pain. In the last group, the
expression ‘Sangavivarjitah' stands, for freedom from attachment,

the term 'Santustah’ stands, for contentment in only God i.e., -
freedom from aversion while the expression ‘Sitosnasukhaduhkhesu

samah' stands, for freedom from pleasure and pain. Thus, there

are clearly five different groups, otherwise the Lord, might have -
not made needless repetition of words.

As there are, five different groups, so a person who possesses :
the marks of anyone of the groups, is a loving devotee, of God. |
The Lord, while explaining the different marks of enlightened
devotees, in each group, wants to mention that their virtues may ;
slightly differ, according to their spiritual practice, fate, caste,
order of life, circumstances and temperaments etc., but all of
them, are totally free from attachment and aversion, pleasure
and pain and such other defects; and they are even-minded and
remain engrossed, in the welfare of all beings, equally. -

A striver, by following the signs of anyone of the five groups,
according to his inclination, faith, ability and temperament, should
try to inculcate them, in him. He should not lose heart, certainly
he will be successful.

Appendix—In these two verses the Lord has mentioned
"
1471,"1416 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 12 7
such cases where it is difficult to be equanimous. If a striver
becomes equanimous in such cases; it will not be difficult for
him to be equanimous in other cases. To remain unaffected is
‘samata’ (equanimity). : 7 :

Though from the viewpoint of a devotee, there is no entity
besides God, yet from the viewpoint of other people a devotee
appears to be alike to foe and friend. Inspite of having the
knowledge of friendship and enmity, he remains even minded.

‘Sitosna sukha duhkhesu’—A devotee remains equanimous
in favourable and unfavourable circumstances pertaining to the TO
body, the senses, the mind, the intellect and also to opinions
and principles etc. He is neither attached to the favourable
circumstances nor has an aversion to the unfavourable ones.

“Yo madbhaktah sa me priyah’, ‘bhaktimanme priyo
narah’—These expressions mean that they are loving to God
because of their devotion for Him, not because of virtues (marks). -
Virtues are not significant but his devotion is significant.

thirty-nine marks of enlightened devotees. Now in the next verse
He answers Arjuna’s question clearly. .

Comment:—

'Ye tu'—-The term ‘Ye’ (who), has been used for those |
"
1472,"Verse 20] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1417
devotees, about whom the question was put, in the first verse
by Arjuna. In response to his question, the Lord in the second
verse, declared the worshippers of the Lord, with attributes, to
be the most perfect, in Yoga. Then, He explained the means to -
perform that worship, and afterwards having explained the marks
of enlightened devotees, now He concludes, the topic. |
- Here, the term 'Ye', stands for those strivers, who having
supreme faith in God, depend on Him and follow spiritual
practice, by treating the marks of enlightened devotees, as |
model virtues. ores
The term ""Tu’, has been used to show the distinction, between °
enlightened devotees and devotees, who are on the way to, God-
realization. By the use of this term, it appears as if the Lord,
loves the striver devotees, more than perfect devotees. -
‘Sraddadhanah'—In the marks of the perfect devotees, there
is no mention of faith, because faith is required, only so long as -
a striver, does not realize God. Therefore, the term stands for,
strivers who have faith in God, and who try to translate immortal .
wisdom (which has been preached by Him from the thirteenth to
the nineteenth verses), into practice, in order to realize God.
Though, in the path of devotion, there is importance of faith
and love (devotion), while in the path of knowledge, there is -
importance of discrimination, yet it does not mean, that there
is no importance of discrimination, in the path of devotion and
no importance of faith, in the path of knowledge. In fact, faith
and discrimination, play an important role, in all spiritual paths. -
Discrimination enhances devotion. Similarly, faith in God and
in scriptures induces a striver, to follow the path of knowledge.
Therefore, faith and discrimination, are helpful in both the paths,
of devotion and knowledge.
'‘Matparamah'—Strivers, following the path of God-realization,
regard the Lord as their supreme goal, in order to, cultivate
"
1473,"1418 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 12

model virtues of enlightened devotees. Thus by thinking of Him,

and by depending upon Him, all those virtues are, naturally,

cultivated in them. — |
This fact, of regarding the Lord as the supreme goal, has :

already been pointed out, in the fifty-fifth verse of the eleventh

chapter, and in the sixth verse of the twelfth chapter. In this verse,

it has been repeated again. It proves, that it plays an important

role, in the path of devotion. When a striver, regards the Lord,

as the supreme goal, by God's grace, he is naturally inspired to |

practise spiritual discipline, and all the stumbling blocks, to his ne re nn

spiritual progress vanish. -
‘Dharmyamrtamidam yathoktam'—The five groups, consisting

of thirty-nine marks, of enlightened devotees, are full of

righteousness or wisdom, having no trace of unrighteousness. Such -

a, discipline is like nectar. So it has been called 'Dharmyamrta’ :

(the nectar of wisdom). But, this path can be followed only, when _

a striver has the only aim of God-realization, without hankering

after riches, honour, praise, prosperity and pleasure etc. -
In every group, all the marks are full of nectar of wisdom.

So a striver, can follow anyone of the groups, by regarding those

virtues, as model. |
Every striver, possesses these virtues partly, and he also -

possesses, evils. Every being possesses both virtues and vices.

One can renounce vices totally, but it is not possible for him

to renounce virtues, totally. An enlightened soul, possesses

only virtues, according to his spiritual path and temperament. ;

So virtues, have been divided into five groups. But vices are to

be renounced totally, so these are not divided, into groups.
A striver, keeps good company, but he does not totally

avoid, bad company. He has self-control, but he also, loses it.

He practises spiritual practice, but also indulges in, anti-spiritual

activities. So he does not attain perfection, he remains, like
"
1474,"Verse 20] _ SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1419 .
common mundane people. Moreover, so long as, he possesses

vices also, with virtues, he is proud of virtues; and pride, is the

root of wicked nature. Therefore, a striver should follow this

nectar of wisdom, by renouncing all vices, otherwise he will
not realize, God. He should try his best, to do away with evils.

If he finds himself unable, to get rid of these, he should pray

to God, with restlessness. | :

All the virtues and virtuous feelings, are born by having
affinity for the real (God), while all the vices and evil feelings |
come from affinity, for the unreal world. Even the vilest person, Rn
cannot totally lack virtues, because he has affinity for the real ~
(God), whose fragment he is. So, he possesses virtues and virtuous
feelings, to some extent or the other. When he realizes God, his
affinity for the unreal, is totally renounced and then all his vices -
and evil feelings, vanish.

Virtues are a divine endowment. The more, a striver is -
inclined to God or he holds Him, as supreme goal, the more,
the virtues and good feelings, are revealed in him and the vices
and evil feelings, vanish. When he realizes God, his affinity for :
the unreal is renounced, and all vices and evil feelings, totally
go away.

Attachment and aversion, pleasure and pain, desire and |
wrath, are modifications of the mind, they are not permanent
features, (Gita 13/6), like the heat in the sun. The heat cannot
be separated, from the sun and so, affinity between the sun
and the heat, is eternal and imperishable, while modifications,
such as desire and anger do not remain permanently, even in
common men these decrease in strivers and are totally absent
in enlightened souls. Had these modifications, been innate, they
would have remained uniform and would not have vanished, till
the inner sense remained. Therefore, they are not innate, and
rather come and go. The more a striver, advances towards his
"
1475,"1420 $RIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12
destination, of God-realization, the evils such as attachment and
aversion become less and less and when God is realized, and
these totally disappear.

The Lord, in the Gita time and again, has exhorted Arjuna :
to renounce attachment and aversion, (3/34, 2/64, 18/51) totally.
It means, that they can be renounced, otherwise the Lord would
not direct Arjuna, to renounce them.

In the Gita, there is also mention, that an enlightened soul,
is totally free from evils, such as attachment and aversion etc. .
These evils are transitory. Had these not been transitory, how oe
could one have been free from them? In this chapter, from the -
thirteenth verse to the nineteenth verses, the Lord, has explained
time and again, that enlightened devotees, are totally free from
evils, such as attachment and aversion etc., because they have -
total disinclination, for the unreal. The Lord, has mentioned this
nectar of wisdom, so that strivers, may follow this by regarding _
the enlightened devotees, as their model.

'‘Paryupasate'—Strivers have great reverence, for enlightened .
devotees. Because, of their natural attraction (devotion) for God,
enlightened devotees, are naturally endowed with divine traits. But,
strivers follow perfect devotees, in order to cultivate their virtues
by totally renouncing evils. They, may not be able to cultivate
all their virtues, but whatever virtue is cultivated, should be
created thoroughly and with faith. No opposite tendency should be
allowed to stay. For instance, strivers may not be compassionate,
thoroughly, but they should not have cruelty, towards anyone. .
Strivers, do not possess these virtues completely, so they have been
asked to follow these virtues (nectar of wisdom), as described,
from the thirteenth to the nineteenth verses of this chapter, with
faith. This is the meaning of 'Paryupasate’. If they possess, all
virtues of anyone of the five contents, they will attain, the status
of perfect devotees.
"
1476,"Verse 20] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1421 -
When a striver, has a burning desire and restlessness, for
God-realization, all his evils get destroyed, because desire and
restlessness destroy those evils. Then, he practises spiritual
discipline, naturally and realizes God, quickly and easily.
""Bhaktaste'tiva me priyah’'—Here, the term 'Bhaktah' stands,
for strivers who follow the path of devotion, by depending
on God.
The Lord, in the fifty-third verse of the eleventh chapter,
having declared that He cannot be seen, either by the study of
Vedas or austerity or charity or sacrifice, in the fifty-fourth verse, ee
mentioned that He can be known and seen by a single-minded 7
_ devotion. In the fifty-fifth verse, He explained the form of single-
minded devotion, by mentioning the marks of his devotees. Then,
in the first verse of this chapter, Arjuna asked, ""Those devotees -
who, ever earnest, worship Thee and again, those who worship
the Imperishable and the Unmanifested—which of them are better
versed in Yoga?"" The Lord, in the second verse, answered the
question, ""Those who fixing their mind, on Me, worship Me, ever
earnest and endowed with supreme faith, are the most perfect :
in Yoga."" Here, while concluding the topic, the Lord uses the
term 'Bhaktah’, for those strivers. |
The Lord, calls such strivers exceedingly dear to Him, while
He calls enlightened devotees only dear to Him. Why? |
(1) The enlightened devotees, have attained perfection or
God-realization; but strivers even without realizing Him, hold
Him as their supreme goal.
(2) Perfect devotees, are like His grown up (wise) sons, while :
strivers are like His small innocent sons, (Manasa 3/43/4).
As a baby is loving to everyone, so is a striver, loving
to God. :
(3) The Lord, becomes free from the debt of perfect devotees,
by enabling them to have His vision, while He holds that He is
"
1477,"1422 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 12 .
indebted to the strivers, because He has not yet enabled, them

to behold Him. So, He declares, that they are exceedingly dear,

to Him.

Appendix—Duty is called ‘dharma’. Not to deviate ;
from dharma is called ‘dharmya’. ‘All is God’—No other
principle can be equal to this principle, therefore this is ‘dharmya’

(Gita 9/2).

A striver keeps faith. But a God-realized soul needs no
faith as he has a direct experience that there is no other entity |
besides God. When all is God, then who should have faith and Sn tn
in whom? A striver holds that there is another entity, so he -
follows the virtues possessed by God-realized devotees but he
has also the feeling that if there is anything else besides God,
that is His pastime. -

In spite of the assumption of the other entity, a striver depends
on God, and none else but God is his beloved, therefore he is _
exceedingly dear to God. Until he realizes ‘All is God’, God
Himself feels indebted to him. | ;

In Srimadbhagavata the Lord declares—

yavat sarvesu bhiittesu madbhave nopajayate

tavadevamupasita vanmanah _— kayavrttibhih

| (11/29/17)

Until a devotee really holds that all beings are God’s
manifestations viz., ‘All is God’, he should worship Me with
all the activities (dealings) of his mind, speech and body.

sarvam brahmatmaham tasya vidyaya’’tmamanisaya

paripasyannuparamet sarvato mukta samSayah

(11/29/18)

‘The devotee by following the above mentioned discipline
becomes determined—‘All is God’. Then he by this spiritual
knowledge, being free from all doubt beholding God everywhere,
"
1478,"Verse 20] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1423
should become calm viz., he should not even think of ‘All is
God’, but he should have a clear vision of God’.

Thirteenth Chapter :

: | INTRODUCTION

At the beginning of the twelfth chapter Arjuna asked Lord
Krsna, ""The devotees who, with their minds constantly fixed in
You, adore You, as possessed of form and attributes, and those ,
who adore only the Imperishable, the Unmanifest—which of BO
these two are better?"" The Lord, responded, ""I consider those
the best, who endowed with supreme faith, having fixed their
mind on Me, worship Me."" Further, He explained, ""Those who
adore only the Imperishable, the Unmanifest also attain Me, but -
greater is their difficulty, because they are centred in the body.”
Then He described the former type of worship, in detail. Now :
He starts the thirteenth chapter in order to explain the latter kind
of worship in detail and in order to remove the main obstacle
in this worship in the form of the identification of the body, |
with the self.

First the Lord starts the topic of discrimination between
Ksetra (Body) and Ksetrajna (Soul) (Spirit). .

The Blessed Lord said:
Body pointed out as ‘this’ (as distinct from the Self), O
"
1481,"1426 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 13 .
Kaunteya, is termed as Ksetra, the field and he, who knows it, as

such, is called, Ksetrajna, by the sages. 1

Comment:— |

‘Idam Sarirarn Kaunteya Ksetramityabhidhiyate'—A man
addresses all the material objects as ‘this beast’, 'this bird’, 'this
tree' etc., (meaning thereby that they are distinctly separate from
him), but sometimes he calls this body as 'T' or sometimes as 'My'.

The fact is that the body which is said to be 'T' or ‘My’ is also
'this' i.e., separate from the Self. Gross, subtle and causal—all |
the three bodies are to be called as ‘this’ or ‘these’. Se ee

The gross (physical) body, consists of five elements—earth, 7
water, fire, air and ether. It is made of mother's ovum and father's
sperm. It is also called 'Annamayako§sa' because it is born of :
evolute of food and is sustained by it. It is known as ‘Idam' -
(this), because it is known by senses. |

The subtle body, consists of five sense-organs, five ;
organs of action, five life-breaths, mind and intellect. It is
called 'Pranamayakosa'’ (sheath of life-breath), because of the _
predominance of life-breath, 'ManomayakoSa' because of the
predominance of mind and 'VijianamayakoSsa’, because of the
predominance of intellect. This subtle body, is also called 'Idam’,
because it is known by the inner sense.

Ignorance, is called the causal body. A man's knowledge
can have an access upto intellect only. Whatever is beyond
intellect, is not open to knowledge. So, it is called ignorance.

This ignorance being the cause of all bodies is called causal
body—'Ajnanamevasya hi mulakaranam’ (Adhyatma., Uttara.
5/9). This causal body, is also called personal nature and also
'Anandamayako§a’ (sheath of bliss). In wakeful state, there is
predominance of gross body and it is accompanied by subtle
body, and causal body as well. In dream there is predominance
of subtle body, which is accompanied by causal body. In sound
sleep, there is predominance of causal body, and’ a person is
"
1482,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1427 ;
neither, aware of the gross body, which is 'Annamayako§sa' nor
of subtle body which is 'PranamayakoSa’, 'Manomayakosa' and
'Vijnanamayakosa' viz., intellect merges in ignorance. Therefore,
sound sleep is a state of causal body. In wakefulness and sleep, |
a man feels pleasure and pain, but in sound sleep, no pain is /
felt, there is only bliss. Therefore, the causal body is called
‘Anandamayako$sa' (sheath of bliss). The causal body is also
called 'Idam’', because it is known by the self.

All the three bodies, are called 'Sarira', because they decay
every moment. (The root of Sarira is ‘St hitnsayam'.) As the -
cover (made of leather) of a sword, is called 'sheath’, similarly, BO
the three bodies of the embodied soul, in which it resides and
which it assumes as its own, are denoted by a sheath. The body |
is called a field (Ksetra), because it is subject to constant decay -
(the root of Ksetra is Ksi, which means decay).

As seeds, sown in a field yield the corresponding crop in
course of time, even so seeds of actions, which a man performs -
by having feelings of egoism and attachment, yield their fruit, at
an appointed time and thus, one is bom, a god, a bird, a beast .
or an insect, etc., according to his actions, and then dies. So it
is called a 'Ksetra' (field).

The body is different from the self, but a man identifies
himself with it, and thus he gets entangled. He himself, being :
a portion of the Lord is sentient and great, but he considers |
himself great, by possessing wealth and property etc. If he
regards himself, as great because of his wealth and property, it |
means that wealth and property, are superior to him. Thus he
degrades himself by attaching too much importance to these and
identifying with them. Therefore Lord advises to view the body
etc., as different from the self by this expression.

'Etadyo vetti'—The soul, knows this body, it is the knower of
the body, senses, mind, intellect and life-breath. But, sometimes
it identifies itself with the body and says 'I am the body’, while
"
1483,"1428 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 13 :
sometimes it assumes its affinity of 'mineness' with the body
and says, ""This body is mine.""
In the first half of this verse, the body has been mentioned
by the term 'Idam’, while in the second half, it has been referred
to as the term 'Etat', yet the ‘Etat’ denotes more nearness, than |
the 'Idam’'. Therefore, the term 'Idam’ stands for the body, while
‘Etat’ means 'T'ness in the body.
""Tam prahuh ksetrajiia* iti tadvidah'—As in the sixteenth verse
of the second chapter, those who know the truth about real and
unreal, are called seers, here those who know the reality about ee
Ksetra (Body) and Ksetrajfia (Soul), are called sages. The soul is -
called Ksetrajna, because it assumes its identity or affinity, with
the body, otherwise it is Supreme Soul, Paramatma (Gita 13/31). |
7
There is bondage for a man if he has assumed his affinity |
of ‘ness, and 'mineness’, with the body. But, actually he is -
different from the body. So, if he realizes the truth, that the
body being 'Idam’' (this), is different from him, he is emancipated. .
This knowledge, about the body that this is different from the
self, is significant, not only for strivers, but also for all human
beings, because all of them are eligible for attaining salvation,
or emancipation. So the Lord, has made this distinction, between ;
the self and the body, just at the beginning of the gospel.
The body, is seen distinct from the self. Therefore, it is called
‘Idam'. The physical body, consisting of earth, water, fire, air
and ether which is ever-changing is ‘Idam' (this). Change in the
body, 1s perceived by five sense-organs—ear, eye, skin, tongue
and nose. Changes in sense-organs are perceived, by the mind.
The change of mind (its fixity or volatility), is perceived by
intellect. The change in the intellect (full understanding, partial
* The term 'Ksetrajiia’ being the object of the verb—'Prahuh’ should have
the second inflexion but because of the word ‘Iti’ there is first inflexion.
"
1484,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1429 -
understanding, no understanding), is known by the self, which
ever remains unchanged. Thus the self is a real onlooker, which
can perceive and know others independently, but can never be
known or seen, by anyone.*
Senses can know their objects, but objects cannot know
senses (which are subtler than and superior to, objects and their
illuminator). Similarly, senses and sense-objects cannot know |
the mind; the mind, senses and sense-objects cannot know the
intellect, while intellect, mind, senses and sense-objects cannot
know; the self. The reason is that senses, mind and intellect, are ee
not an independent knower. Each can know objects of grosserform . -
than it, while the self is an independent knower, because it is far
subtler than and superior to a body, senses, mind and intellect.
Though, it has been mentioned that sense-organs, mind -
and intellect are also perceivers (onlookers), yet the fact 1s,
that these can perceive, only when they are accompanied by
the self, because the mind and intellect etc., being evolutes of -
matter (Prakrti)—(Nature) cannot be independent onlookers. The
self, 1s the real onlooker. -
Now a question arises, as to how the soul which is sentient,
becomes an onlooker of the insentient intellect etc., because the
onlooker can see objects of its own class? The answer is, that
the soul identifies itself, with the insentient matter and accepts ”
its own separate entity as 'I am’. This 'T' is neither insentient, nor
sentient. By identifying itself with matter, it (man) says, ""I am
rich or I am learned."" By giving high value to embodiment of
consciousness (self), it says, ""I am Brahma’. Thus this T’, is the :
soul seated in Nature, which is the cause of his birth, in good
* First of all the eye is the onlooker while the form is the object to be
seen. Then mind is the onlooker while the senses such as eyes are the objects to
be seen. Then intellect is the onlooker and the mind is the object to be seen. At
last the soul is the onlooker of the dispositions of the intellect but the soul can't
be seen by anyone.
"
1485,"1430 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter13
and bad wombs (13/21). Thus, the embodied soul, has both the
portions, the sentient, as well as the insentient. The sentient

) portion, attracts him towards the Lord, while the insentient portion
because of identity with matter, attracts him towards matter, and
thus he becomes an onlooker of intellect, mind, senses, sense- |
objects and body etc. This assumed identity, or affinity, is the
root cause of all evils. |

Appendix—The term ‘Idam’ (ksetra), comprises infinite
universes. In infinite universes, in all the beings ‘para’ (the Self)
is “ksetrajiia’ and ‘apara’ (the world) is ‘ksetra’. A striver (the ee
Self) is the knower of the world and he believes in God. The -
knower is more pervading. Therefore there are infinite universes,
in a fragment of Ksetrajia—‘yena sarvamidarh tatam’ (Gita 2/17).

A striver should know. that he is not ksetra but he is ksetrajfia, _
the knower of ksetra. |

The objective world is in a fragment of the seer (onlooker).

As all objects are seen with the eye, but it does not mean that -
the eye can’t see more objects. Therefore the eye is bigger than

the objective world. We may know innumerable facts with the
intellect but it does not mean that intellect has no further power

to know more. In it there is further scope to know more, therefore
intellect is more extensive than the innumerable facts known with

it. The origin, existence and dissolution of Brahma are also within -
the knowledge of our intellect. All the bodies—gross, subtle and
causal are the entities to be perceived. The whole phenomenal
existence is in a fragment of the seer (Ksetrajna).

A man is called ‘wealthy’ because he possesses wealth,
but if he has no wealth, the person remains but he is no more
called ‘wealthy’. Similarly the self is called ‘ksetrajfia’ by
having affinity with ‘ksetra’ but when affinity with ‘ksetra’ is
renounced, the self remains but it is no more called ‘ksetrajna’. It
means that the same pure-consciousness (from the view-point of
understanding) is called ‘ksetrajiia’ by having affinity with ‘ksetra’,
"
1486,"Verse 2] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI » 1431 |
is called imperishable by having affinity with the perishable, is
called—‘Sariri’ (embodied soul) by having relation with ‘Sarira’
(body), is called ‘drasta’ by being related with ‘“drSya’, is called :
‘saksi’ (witness) by having connection with ‘saksya’ (object to |
be witnessed) and is called a doer (karta) by being connected
with instruments (Karana). In fact that entity is nameless. That
iS mere awareness.

Know Me as the knower of self (Ksetrajiia) in all the bodies
(Ksetras), Arjuna. The Knowledge of Ksetra and Ksetrajiia, is -
considered true knowledge, by Me. 2
Comment:— |
'Ksetrajiiam capi mam viddhi sarvaksetresu bharata'—In all
Ksetras (fields or bodies), 'I am’, consists of two parts 'T’, and ‘am’.
In 'I am’ 'T is Ksetra (which has been mentioned as ‘Etat’, in the
preceding verse), while 'am', the knower of 'Tness, is Ksetrajiia -
(which has been called the knower, by the term, ""Yah vetti'. It is |
called 'am', because of the use of the word 'T’. If it is not used =
with 'T, it will not remain ‘am’, but it will remain ‘Is'. The reason |
is that, 'Is' is called 'am' because of its use with 'T’. Therefore, in
fact, 'Ksetrajiia’ (am), has its affinity with God (Is). So the Lord
declares, ""Know Me, as Ksetrajia, in all Ksetras.""
The object, known is called 'Jiieya’, and that 'Jieya' is known,
through an organ. There are two types of organs—outer and inner.
A man, knows objects with outer organs (ears, eyes etc.,) and
knows the outer organs with inner organs (mind, intellect etc.).
"
1487,"1432 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA (Chapter 13
The inner organ, has four faculttes—mind, intellect, cogitation and
ego. Out of these ego is the subtlest. Ego is known by luminous
'Ksetrajnia’. This ‘Ksetrajiia’, is an embodiment of God. |

Here the Lord, uses the term ""Viddhi' (know), to impress :
upon Arjuna, that he should know that he has his identity with
Him, not with the body. As he identifies himself, with the
body and regards the body as his own, so should he identify
himself with Him (oversoul), and regard Him, as his own. As
the self (soul), and the Lord, have been identified here, they
have also been identified in the seventeenth verse of the second So .
chapter, when the Lord declares, for the soul, ""Know that to -
be imperishable, by which all the universe is pervaded” and
in the fourth verse of the ninth chapter, when He declares for |
Himself, ""All this universe is pervaded by Me."" Thus the Lord, -
identifies the Ksetrajia (His portion), with Himself. Further in
the thirty-fourth verse of this chapter, he explains the identity of
bodies and world (the evolutes of prakrti), with prakrti (matter). :
The Lord, exhorts Arjuna to have a disinclination for the body,
which is a portion of prakrti and an inclination instead for Him,
because he is His portion. |

In fact, a body has its identity with the world, while the
soul (Ksetrajnia), has its identity with the Lord. But the man
(soul), by assuming his identity with the body, regards himself 7
as separate, from the Lord. So the Lord, wants Arjuna to know
the truth, about the body and the soul.

By the term 'Api' (also), the Lord emphasizes the significant
fact, that in the scriptures He is described as, all pervasive. No
doubt, an all pervasive God, He is. But, in different bodies as
different souls also is He. The gist of this comment is, that the
individual soul, is not different from, the oversoul. The individual
soul is He Himself, and one should realize his identity, with Him.

Man, himself is different from the world, but he has his
identity, with the Lord. So, he can know the world im reality,
"
1488,"Verse 2] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1433 .
when he observes the world, being detached from it. But, he
can have a true knowledge of the Lord, by identifying himself,

_- with Him.

'Ksetraksetrajiayorjianam yattajjianam matam mama'—The .
Ksetra (body), has its identity with the world, while the Ksetrajiia
(Soul) has its identity with the Lord—this is true knowledge. By
the expression 'Matarn mama’, He wants to lay emphasis upon
the point that knowledge of several languages, scripts, arts and
sciences etc., and even, of the whole world, is not, true knowledge,
because this knowledge, entraps a man into the world, though :
it may be useful. True knowledge, enables him to renounce his OO
affinity with the body, and be free, from the cycle of birth and
death. The self, is different from the body and one, with the
cosmic soul. This is true knowledge.

Appendix—Ksetrajnia (soul) and Brahma (the Absolute) are
one. Having relationship with one ‘ksetra’, this soul is called
‘ksetrajiia’ and when it is free from the relationship of all -
‘ksetras’, it is ‘Brahma’.

‘idarh Sarirarh kaunteya ksetram’—This expression proves .
that there is identification of the body (Ksetra) with infinite
universes (the entire creation) and the expression ‘Ksetrajnarn
capi marh viddhi’ proves that the Self is identified with the
endless, boundless and limitless God. Therefore anything which .
is farthest from us (the Self) is the body and any entity which
is nearest is God. It means that the body and the world are one
and the Self and God are one (Gita 15/7). This is knowledge.

The term ‘mam’ has been used for Brahma which means that
Brahma and God are not two but only one—‘maya tatamidarn :
sarvamn jagadavyaktamurtina’ (Gita 9/4) ‘all this universe is
pervaded by Me in My unmanifest form’. The Supreme Reality,
which pervades endless universes without being tainted, is Brahma
and He, Who is the master of endless universes, is God.

of Ksetra and Ksetrajna, is true knowledge. In the next verse,

what its glory is; hear briefly from Me. 3
Comment:— |

'Tatksetram'—The term ‘Tat’ (that), denotes, first the topic ;
discussed earlier, and secondly, it denotes distance. What has
been termed 'Idam’, in the first verse of this chapter, has been _
termed ‘tat’, here. Ksetra does not pervade everywhere nor does
it remain forever and it is decaying every moment, even now—it ;
shows its distinctiveness and distance from the self.

""Yacca'—'What is that Ksetra, is described, in the fifth verse
of this chapter. _

""Yadrkca'—'What is it like’, has been described in the twenty-
sixth and twenty-seventh verses, as emanated and perishable (liable
to appear and disappear).

'Yadvikari'—Though being evolutes of prakrti, twenty-three
elements, have also been called modifications, yet here, the term,
refers to modifications, such as desire and aversion etc., which
have been enumerated, in the sixth verse and which are born of
assumed affinity, between Ksetra and Ksetrajna.

~ ""Yatagca yat'—'Whence is what'—This expression, conveys
the intention of the Lord, to trace the origin of this Ksetra, and it
has been described, in the second half of the nineteenth verse.
"
1490,"Verse 3] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1435 .
'Sa ca'—'Sa' (that), denotes Ksetrajiia, mentioned in the second

half of the first verse, and we are advised to listen to the Lord,

regarding that Ksetrajna. —
""Yah'—The term 'Yah' (Who), conveys the intention of the

Lord, to reveal its true character, as has been enumerated in

the second half of the twentieth verse, and also in the twenty-

second verse.
'Yatprabhavasca'—The power (glory), of the soul, has

been described, in the verses thirty-first to thirty-third of the

chapter. | | Se
'Tatsamasena me Srnu'—The term, ‘Tat’, here stands both -

for Ksetra and Ksetrajiia. So the Lord asks Arjuna to hear from

Him, the description of four points about Ksetra, and two points |

about Ksetrajfia. | : _
In the first two verses of this chapter, there is a brief

description of Ksetra and Ksetrajna, which has been called

‘knowledge’, by Him. But detailed description starts, from the :

third verse, and so Lord Krsna asks Arjuna, to listen to what,

He says on Ksetra and Ksetrajfia. -
In this verse, the Lord orders Arjuna, to hear the four points

regarding Ksetra while only two pomts—who that Ksetrajiia is

and what his powers (glories) are, regarding Ksetrajia. Now

a doubt arises, why the Lord has not discussed the powers _

(glories), of Ksetra and why He has not described the nature of

Ksetrajiia, its modifications, and origin. The explanation is, how

Ksetra which decays every moment, can have any glory. Worldly |

people, out of ignorance attach importance to riches. Actually, _

it has no power or glory. So the Lord has not described it. The

Lord has started that the Ksetrajiia, is imperishable, therefore,

his nature is also imperishable. So, there is no need to describe

his nature, separately, the nature is included in, ‘who that

Ksetrajna is'. Ksetrajia, does not undergo any modifications,

the modifications such as desire and aversion etc., appear in
"
1491,"1436 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter13
him, because of his assumed affinity with Ksetra. So, there

is no question of describing his modifications, as Ksetrajiia

is immutable or without modifications. Ksetrajiia is non-dual,
beginningless and eternal. As, he has no origin, so no question =
arises of describing from whom, he has originated.

Appendix—The Lord by the expression ‘tatsamasena me $rmu’
means to say that a striver need not know more and more. In
knowing more, more time will be spent but less spiritual discipline
will be practised. |

the true meaning of 'Ksetra’ and 'Ksetrajia, by the terms, the .
insentient and the sentient, the unreal and the real, the body and

'Chandobhirvividhaih prthak'—The term ‘'Chandobhih' (Vedic

Vedas—Rk, Yajuh, Sama and Atharva, including thew Sarhhita
(Hymnical texts), as well as Brahmana (the theological portion of

The five great elements, and the ego, the intellect, the Primordial
Matter (Nature), the ten senses, the mind and five objects of senses
(this is Ksetra, which includes twenty-four elements). 5
Comment:— : : /
‘Avyaktameva ca'—Here, the term 'Avyakta’, stands for
Primordial Matter, (Nature). Primordial Nature, being the cause
of cosmic intelligence and being the evolute of none, is only |
‘prakrti'.
""Buddhih'—This term, stands for cosmic intelligence. It is
‘prakrti' as it gives birth to ego, and being an evolute of Primordial
Nature, it is 'Vikrti'. It means, that this cosmic intelligence is,
‘Prakrti- Vikrtt'. ,
‘Ahankarah'—This term, stands for the cosmic ego. Being the
"
1493,"1438 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter13
cause of five subtle elements, it is 'prakrti' and being an evolute
of intelligence, it is ""Vikrti’. So it is 'Prakrti-Vikrti'.

. ""Mahabhitani’'—The five great (subtle) elements, are—ether, __
air, fire, water and earth. These are of two kinds—mixed and __ -
unmixed. If each of the elements is divided into five parts, and
then one part of each is mixed, that is a mixed element.* If they
remain separate, they are called unmixed. Here, the five elements,
are unmixed. The five elements, are also known as, subtle elements
(suksma mahabhuta) and subtle forms of matter (tanmatras).

These elements, being the cause of ten senses, one mindand _ .........
five objects of senses, are called prakrti while being the evolute -
of ego they are Vikrti. Thus these elements are 'Prakrti-Vikrti’.

""Indriyani daga'—The tongue, hands, feet, the generative
organ and the organ of defecation—these are, the five organs = -

_ Of action; while senses of hearing, touch, sight, taste and smell,
constitute the five senses of perception. Being the effect of five
_ gubtle elements but being the cause of none, these are ""Vikrti.' ""

'Ekam ca'—The term 'Ekam’, stands for the mind. It, being the

evolute of five elements and being cause of none, is 'Vikrti’. .
- ‘'Pafica cendriyagocarah'—Sound, touch, colour, taste and

smell, the objects of five senses of perception being the effects,

not the cause, are 'Vikrti'. 7

Thus, the five subtle elements, ego and intellect—these
seven are Prakrti-Vikrti, the Primordial Matter, is Prakrti and
ten senses, mind, and five objects of senses—these sixteen are
Vikrtis. These twenty-four elements, constitute the Ksetra. A ,
meagre portion of this Ksetra, is this human body, which has
been termed as 'Idarh Sariram' (this body), in the first and '‘tat-
ksetram’, (that Ksetra), in the third verse.

iccha dvesah sukham duhkham sanghatascetana dhrtih |

etatksetram samasena savikaramudahrtam

Desire and aversion, pleasure and pain, the body and
consciousness (life-breath), firmness: these comprise the Ksetra,
with its modifications, described briefly. 6 |
Comment:—

‘Iccha'—This term, denotes a passionate longing, for the
acquisition of an object, a person or circumstances etc. First of -
all, the Lord mentions the evil in the form of desire, because
this longing (desire) is the root of all evils, pains and sins. |

'‘Dvesah'—Unfulfilment of desire and hurt to one's pride -
leads to anger. A subtle form of anger, is aversion. Thus the
term ‘aversion’ includes, jealousy and anger etc.

‘Sukham'—A feeling of pleasure aroused in the mind, by the :
appearance of agreeable circumstances, is called ‘Sukha’.

‘Duhkham'—Agony, caused in the mind, by disagreeable .
circumstances, is ""Duhkha’'.

'Sanghatah'—This term, stands for a physical body consisting
of twenty-four elements. After being born, the seeming existence
of this body, is a modification and its constant change, is also
a modification (Vikara).

'Cetana'—The term, refers to life-breath. It undergoes
modifications. It remains calm in sattva mode but is disturbed |
when a man is overwhelmed with grief, worry and fear etc. This
life-breath ever decays. Therefore, it is a modification.

Common people, call the creature having life-breath, as
same way. Half of each remains the same and the remaining half is divided
into four parts and each of the parts is given to the other four elements. Thus
the mixture of all the elements is known as the mixed element.
"
1495,"1440 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter13
'Cetana' ‘and without life-breath as 'Acetana'.. Therefore, life-
breath, is called 'Cetana’.

‘Dhrtih'—'Dhrti'’, denotes firmness. It undergoes modifications. _
A man deviates from firmness, in unfavourable circumstances. _
Sometimes, he is firm, while other times he deviates from
firmness. Sometimes he is more firm, sometimes less. Sometimes
he holds virtues, sometimes vice. Being subject to change, it is
modification of Ksetra. |

[This firmness of three modes viz., sattvika, rajasika and —
tamasika, has been described, from the thirty-third verse to the
thirty-fifth verse of the eighteenth chapter. Sattvika firmness, is
very necessary, for spiritual progress.] |

'Etatksetrarn samasena savikaramudahrtam'—As, in the first _
verse of this chapter, the expression 'Idam Sariram’', was used to
show a distinction, between the self and the body, similarly the
term 'Etat', has been used to prove the distinction of the seer -
(self), from the seen (Ksetra, and its modification).

In the fifth verse, the Lord described the Ksetra, in the form of _ -
the world, while in this verse, He describes, it as a body with its
modifications. Actually, the world and the body are one, and the
same, as these belong to the same class. As, in the second verse
of this chapter, the Lord described His identity with Ksetrajna_
(soul), here he describes the identity of the body along with its
modifications, with the world. In the twenty-first verse, instead
of saying that the spirit is seated in the individual body, He
declares, the spirit to be seated in cosmic Matter. This proves,
that if a man assumes his identity with an individual body, he,
automatically gets connected with cosmic matter, as the micro
and macro parts are, one and the same. As a matter of fact,
there is no micro (individual), only macro (cosmos), is there.
The conception of individuality is a mistake. It means, that an
individual body, and cosmic Matter, are the same. As waves of
an ocean, are not different from the ocean, so is the individual —_ | oo
"
1496,"Verse 6] : SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1441
body, not different from the world. Therefore, the notion that
individuality, is separate from cosmos, is a mistake.
When the Ksetrajiia (spirit), out of ignorance, assumes its
affinity with Ksetra (body), evils such as desire and aversion etc.,
are born, in the Ksetra. In fact, Ksetrajna by nature, is totally. free,
from all kinds of evils and modifications. It is affinity, between
the two which is responsible, for all evils and modifications... If
a striver, realizes that he is different from the body, and he has .
his identity with the Lord, he becomes free, from all evils and TO
modifications. -
On Self-realization, desire and aversion, are totally annihilated.
Such a realized soul, is conscious of pleasure and pain viz., or
favourable and unfavourable circumstances. But these do not _ -
cause any modification in mind viz., he does not feel, happy
and sad.* :
_ The body of a liberated soul, becomes supremely holy and
pious, and he has no affinity of 'I' and ‘mine’, with the body. ;
His body remains alive, according to his destiny. Till the body
lives, life-breath also lives. On working hard, life-breath becomes
turbulent, otherwise, it is calm. The Sattvika, firmness which
subsisted during practice, remains even, on Self-realization. |
But on realization, the liberated. soul has no affinity with
modifications—'Cetana’ and ‘Dhrti’, as he has no identity with
the inner sense. |
It means that four evils—desire, aversion, pleasure and
pain—which were due to his identification with the body, |
are totally destroyed, on Self-realization. Three modifications—
‘Sanghata’, 'Cetana’ and 'Dhrti', remain in his life, but they do
not affect him.
* Knowledge of anything is not defective (as while having meal a man
may know the taste of a dish) but attachment or aversion to it is defective.
"
1497,"1442 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter13

Appendix—When the Self has affinity with ksetra, evils
such as desire, aversion; pleasure, pain etc., arise in ksetrajiia—
‘purusah sukhaduhkhanam bhoktrtve heturucyate’ (13/20). All
evils such as desire and aversion etc., abide in the ego (knot _
between the sentient and the insentient). In ego also these evils __
abide in the insentient fragment only.

Here the Lord has called the body consisting of twenty-
four elements and its seven modifications as ‘etat’ (this)—
‘etatksetram’. It means that the Self is not identified with

_ksetra but is totally different. The three bodies—gross, subtle =  ~—_|
and causal being within the term ‘etat’ are not the Self. Herea = _
point needs special attention that when even ‘mahattattva’ (cosmic
intelligence) and ‘mula prakrti’ (Primordial Matter) have been
mentioned as ‘etat’, then ‘ego’ is certainly included in ‘etat’, there |
is no doubt about it. Nearer than ‘ego’ to the self is ‘Cosmic
intelligence’ and nearer than ‘Cosmic intelligence’ is ‘Prakrti’,
that Prakrti is also included in ‘etatksetram’. It means that ‘ego’ _.
is not ‘the Self’ at all. The man, who discerns the Self and ego
(ksetra) as separate entities, is not born again and he realizes |
God (Gita 13/23). . |
_ Link:—When a man identifies himself with the body, evils
such as desire and aversion, are born and they affect him. |
Therefore, the Lord, in the next five verses under the name of
Jnana’ (Wisdom), enumerates twenty virtues to do away, with
the assumed identity. |

1498,"Verse 7] ~  SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1443
forgiveness, straightforwardness, service to the teacher, purity of
body and mind, steadfastness, and self-control. 7
Comment:— |
‘Amanitvam'—Absence of pride is known as ‘Amanitva’. It -
is the superiority complex, because of one's possessions, of arts, :
virtues, wealth, ability etc., that engender, conceit or pride. One
possesses a superiority complex, because of his identity, with the
body. It means, that he attaches too much importance to matter
and so he cannot, know the truth. The Jess proud a man ts, the
lesser importance he attaches to matter. The less importance he -
attaches to matter, the lesser proud, he is, and the more speedily, Be
he follows spiritual discipline.
Remedy:—A striver, should keep company with devout
devotees, saints and liberated souls. Their company frees him, -
not only from pride, but also from many other evils.
Saints honour others, but themselves remain free, from the
desire of honour (Manasa 7/38/2). Similarly, a striver in order -
to be free from pride, should have the habit to offer honour,
respect and praise etc., to others. He can form this habit, only .
when he regards others superior, to him in any sphere. It is a
tule, that every person has some speciality. This may be due
to his caste (order of life), stage of life, learning, intelligence
and rank etc. Therefore, a striver should offer respect, to others |
keeping their uniqueness, in mind. When, it becomes his habit,
his desire to covet honour is gradually wiped out. He must be
cautious, that while offering honour to others, he should not
expect honour, in return. |
Out of all the divine traits, the Lord has mentioned, fearlessness
as the first one (16/1) and absence of pride (16/3) the last, in
the Discipline of Devotion. But in the Discipline of Knowledge,
He has given priority to absence of pride (13/7) and referred
"
1499,"1444 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter13 -
to fearlessness, at the end—'Perception of God’ (the object of
true knowledge) (13/11). It means, that a devotee, like Prahlada

_ beholds the Lord pervading everywhere, and so becomes, fearless
at the beginning. He offers regard, honour and praise etc., to
others, without having any pride. At last, his assumed affinity -
with the body perishes, and he becomes totally free, from pride.
But a striver, following the Discipline of Knowledge, does not
assume his identity with the body, at the very beginning (13/1)
and so, has no pride. At last he realizes the self as pervading
everywhere and becomes fearless.

'Adambhitvam'—Hypocrisy, means putting on a pretence or -~ = = = ) ~
false appearance, of virtue or goodness, for the sake of honour, __
prestige and worship etc. If a sinner, in the company of virtuous
persons, exhibits himself as a devotee, a righteous or a charitable
person, he is a hypocrite. Similarly, if a striver, is engaged in ~
adoration and prayer etc., in loneliness, and is feeling drowsy, but
he becomes alert, as soon as he hears the footsteps of someone |
coming, it is also a subtle hypocrisy. Thére is also, hypocrisy
when a pious and virtuous person, in the company of bad persons
renounces his piety and virtues, and poses himself as others are, __
as can be seen in clubs and hotels etc. Absence, of this sort of
hypocrisy, is ‘Adambhitva.'

Remedy:—A striver, should fix the goal of human life, that _
he has to realize God, and that he should ever be engaged in
adoration, and other spiritual practices, without caring for, what
the people think of him and say, about him.

'Ahimsa'—Non-violence, means total absence of violence.

It consists in inflicting no pain, on anyone, through a body, |
speech or mind. Pain or injury, can be inflicted in three ways—by
one's own self, getting it inflicted by others, and by abetting
it. Violence is inflicted, either out of anger, greed or delusion.
Thus, violence is of nine kinds. Again, the nine kinds can be
divided according to quantity, in three parts—a little, more,
"
1500,"Verse 7] _ SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1445 -
much more. Thus, the types of violence, come to twenty-seven.

These twenty-seven kinds, of violence, can be inflicted through

body, speech and mind. In this way, violence can be inflicted,

in eighty-one ways.

Non-violence, can also be divided into four categories, -
according to place, occasion, time and person. A man may
observe non-violence, in places of pilgrimage and temples, on
occasions, such as on festivals, on days, such as a birthday and
death anniversary etc., and to a person etc., such as cows, deer, |
preceptor, parents and children etc. -

Total abstention from violence, or inflicting pain on any ee
creature, at any place and time through speech, body or mind, :
is called universal non-violence.

Remedy:—A striver, should regard comfort, welfare and
service of others, as his own, because the self, in every person -
is the same. By arousing this sort of discrimination, how can
a person, inflict pain or injury on anyone? A feeling of non- .
violence, automatically develops, in him.

'Ksantih'—'Ksanti’, means forbearance i.e., forgiveness. He, ;
who has developed this feeling, never thinks of punishing an
evil-doer, either himself or having him punished by others, in
anyway. Even in having power, he does not nurse any thought
of revenge, upon him.

Remedy:—(1) Forgiveness in the self, is self-evident,
because the self is free, from all modifications and evils. So a
striver, should have a firm belief, that he remains unaffected,
by evil and wrong done to him. This belief, naturally, develops |
forgiveness. |

(2) He beholds the self, present in all beings (6/29). If while
having a meal the tongue is chewed, a person is not angry with
his teeth, because the tongue and the teeth, both are his own
parts, similarly, the same self, abides in all the beings. So a
person, possessing the virtue of forgiveness, never entertains,

the idea of punishing a wrong-doer.

'‘Arjavam'—It means, straightforwardness of body, mind and
speech. No sense, of ornamentation, in the body. Simplicity in
living, natural straightforwardness, in behaviour, absence of .
arrogance—this is straightforwardness of body. Absence of |
crookedness, deceit, envy and aversion etc., and serenity,
benevolence and compassion, these include straightforwardness
of mind. Absence of taunt, censure, malicious gossip and pinching,
harsh language and use of simple, true, aggreable and wholesome
language—this is straightforwardness of speech. ee

Remedy:—A man by assuming his affinity, with the gross, -
subtle and causal bodies, regards himself superior to others. So
he does not possess straightforwardness, of mind, speech and
behaviour. If he renounces this assumed affinity with the body, _
and has an eye on the self, he becomes straightforward.

Acaryopasanam'—A teacher, who imparts knowledge and
teaches good precepts, is called an Acarya. If anyone serves, such
a type of teacher, he is benefitted. But here the term 'AcArya’,
denotes a liberated soul. Bowing to him, paying reverence to him, -
and serving him with body, mind and speech, in order to make
him happy—this is service, to him. But real service, consists in
translating his principles into practice. The service rendered to
the body, of a conscious man is regarded as service to him. But, :
to render service to the body of a realized soul, is not service,
in its real sense. It is only partial service.

In the Discipline of Devotion, there is not so much need of a |
preceptor, as in the Discipline of Knowledge, because a devotee,
following the path of devotion, entirely depends on God. So the
Lord by his grace, provides gain and security (9/22), removes all
difficulties and obstacles (18/58) and enables him to behold the
Divine presence, within himself (10/11). But, in the Discipline
of Knowledge a striver depends on his spiritual practice, which
has some defects, such as follows—
"
1502,"Verse 7] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1447 OF

(1) A striver, having received knowledge through scriptures
and saints, assumes that he is different from the body and so he
attains peace, and he thinks, that he has realized the self. But,
when he comes across favourable and unfavourable circumstances,
he feels pleasure and pain. It means, that he has not realized, :
the self.

(2) When anyone calis him by his name, he thinks, he is
that person. It means, that he is still established, in the body.

(3) An emancipated soul, has natural discrimination between
the sentient and the insentient. But a striver, discriminates the -
real from the unreal, during wakefulness and he forgets it, during OT
sleep. He gets hold of this discrimination again, while he awakes
from sleep.

(4) When a striver, serves saints and preceptors and takes -
an active part in good company, he thinks, that he should be
considered superior, to others by the saints and preceptors.

Thus a striver, regards his imperfect knowledge, as perfect. “
So the Lord by the term 'Acaryopasanam', wants to emphasize
the fact, that a striver, following the path of knowledge, should -
practise spiritual discipline, under the guidance of a teacher. In
the thirty-fourth verse of the fourth chapter also, Lord Krsna said
to Arjuna, ""Go to the liberated souls, prostrate yourself at their
feet, render them all forms of service, and question them with a |
guileless heart, then they will unfold knowledge to you."" In this
way, wise men remove the defects of a striver, which he himself
does not know, easily, and enable him to realize, the Lord.

A striver, should go to such a preceptor, who according to |
him is endowed with, the following traits. |

1. He should be a liberated soul.

2. He should know, the Disciplines of Action, Knowledge,
and Devotion etc., in the right perspective.

3. His company and words, remove doubts even without
being referred. |
"
1503,"1448 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 13
4. His company, gives solace and peace.
_ 5. His relationship with a striver, is only for his welfare,
without having any selfish motive.
6. He does not expect anything, of the striver, in the least. °
7. All his activities are directed; towards the welfare of strivers.
8. His company, enhances the spiritual inclination, of strivers.
9. His company, sight, discourses and remembrance, remove
wicked traits and develop divine traits, in the strivers. :
10. He is uncommon, and singular and has, no equal. Co
So a striver, should serve and obey such a preceptor, with -
faith and reverence. He should live with a preceptor, only for
his emancipation. He should not worry about, what his preceptor
does and what he does not do, and why he does so, and so on. _
He should depend on his preceptor, and act according to his
behest, and hints. If such a preceptor, does not accept a striver
as his disciple formally, the striver should not insist on it. He :
should accept him, as his preceptor by heart.
If such a liberated soul, is not available, a striver should
take refuge, in the Lord. By doing so, either the Lord Himself
guides him as a preceptor, or makes a preceptor available.
Remedy:—A striver who aims at God-realization, should serve
the saints from his heart, because their grace, bears quick fruit. |
He should, have this conviction and act accordingly.
A disciple, should serve his teacher. If a disciple performs .
his duty, scrupulously, his affinity with the world is renounced,
and he -gets identified with, the truth in teacher viz., virtues of
his teacher develop in him. Having renounced affinity, with the
world, he attains salvation and having identified himself with the
truth in teacher, he develops devotion. With this identification he
does not remain a disciple, and he is not controlled by scriptures
"
1504,"Verse 7] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1449 ~
etc. But if a disciple, does not perform his duty, scrupulously,
he will remain only a nominal disciple, not a real one. Without
remaining a real disciple, his affinity with the world will not
be renounced, and he will not get identified, with the teacher.
Thus, he will remain a slave, to the world. ~
If a disciple expects of his teacher to lead him alone to
salvation—Tt is also a bondage, for the disciple. A disciple, should
surrender himself to his preceptor, without having any will of his
own. He should become a yesman, to his preceptor's will. |
It is the foremost duty of a preceptor, to emancipate his .
disciple. If he does not perform his duty, he is a nominal preceptor.
: If he has a desire to receive anything (money, respect, praise
etc.,) from his disciple, he is not a teacher but he is a slave, to
the disciple. |
'Saucam'—'Saucam', means external and internal purity. The
body, is purified by cleaning it with water and earth etc., while
the mind is purified by having divine traits, such as mercy,
forgiveness and generosity etc.
Remedy:—The body, is made of filthy materials. It may be .
cleaned again and again, yet it contains filth. By knowing the
fact, that it is full of filth, a striver becomes indifferent and
detached to it.
Earning money by truthful and honest means, according
to one's caste and stage of life, without laying claim to others’
property, etc., and purity of diet, purify the mind.
'Sthairyam'—It denotes steadfastness or firmness. A striver,
should be firm, in his aim of God-realization, in the face of .
difficulties, dangers and obstacles.
Remedy:—(1) People attached to worldly pleasures and
prosperity, cannot have their determinate intellect, concentrated
on God (Gita 2/44). So a striver, should renounce this attachment,
to worldly pleasures and prosperity.
"
1505,"1450 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter13.
(2) A striver, should remain firm, in whatever he decides,
even on insignificant tasks. By doing so, he forms a habit of
being firm, in other spheres also.
(3) The more faith a striver has, in saints and scriptures, .
the more firm, he is. °
'Atmavinigrahah'—Here, the term 'Atma’, stands for the mind,
and control over the mind is ‘Atmavinigrahah'. Some thoughts,
come to the mind and these disappear quickly. They are called
‘Sphuranas’, (fleeting thoughts). But, when the mind is attached, :
to that thought, it becomes a ‘Sankalpa’ (pursuit or projection SO
of the mind). ‘Sphurana’, is just like an image in the mirror, the _
mirror does not catch the image, while 'Sankalpa’ is like a film
in a camera, which catches the image. A man, is attached to the |
thoughts, by having, attachment and aversion, for them. Fleeting -
thoughts, are destroyed by practice, while pursuits of the mind,
are destroyed by dispassion. Thus the mind, can be controlled
by practice, and dispassion (Gita 6/35). |
Remedy:—(Refer to the explanation of the twenty-sixth verse
of the sixth chapter, for controlling the mind.) -
Appendix—The Lord enumerates the virtues under the name
of ‘Jnana’ (wisdom) in order to do away with the assumed
identity of the Self with the ksetra. These virtues are helpful in
renouncing this identification. :

indriyarthesu) vairagyamanahankara eva _ ca
janmamrtyujaravyadhiduhkhadosanudarsanam
Dispassion towards the objects of senses and absence of egoism;
constant perception of evil and misery in birth, death, old age and
disease. 8 |
"
1506,"Verse 8] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1451 -
Comment:—
Indriyarthesu vairagyam'—It denotes, absence of attraction |
and attachment, for all the objects of senses, of this world as
well as the next, in the form of sound, touch etc., which are
enjoyed by senses. For the maintenance of his life, a striver :
should not have attachment and passion etc., with sense-objects,
even during physical contact with them.
Remedy:—(1) Attachment to the objects of senses, develops
a sense of importance for them, which leads to sins and deprives
a striver, of God-realization. Only, by effacing attachment, we _
can get established in God. This conviction, develops detachment ee me ae
from sense-objects. : -
(2) Even great kings and emperors, could not enjoy sensual
pleasures forever. Their bodies, decayed and they died. This
thought, develops dispassion. -
(3) Sensual enjoyments, lead persons to grief and worry,
only. Sense enjoyment does not bless, one with any eminence -
and singularity. This thought also develops dispassion.
'‘Anahankara eva ca'—Everyone, feels, 'I am’. Identification
of 'I', with that, body, gives birth to, 'I am body'. The feeling
‘I am body’, gives birth to, egoism. This identification of the
self with body, is the cause of a man's birth, in good and evil
bodies (Gita 13/21). Actually, this egoism has no existence of |
its own, but it emanates from the identification of the self, with
a body. But when a striver, distinguishes the sentient from the
insentient, his egoism disappears. Thus strivers, can be free from
this feeling of egoism. An affinity with worldly objects and a
feeling of superiority, because of one's renunciation, dispassion .
etc., give birth to pride. Here, the term 'Anahankara’, denotes
absence of pride and egotism both.
When a man awakes from his sleep, he first of all knows, ‘I
am’. Then he believes that he belongs to a particular caste or creed
etc. This is a routine process to realize the ego. Similarly there
"
1507,"1452 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 13 -
is an order for freeing oneself from a feeling of egoism. First, a
striver, renounces the pride of wealth etc., which he has, because
of assumed affinity with, the gross body. Secondly, his pride of
doership, because of affinity with organs of actions, is destroyed. :
Then the pride of knowership, because of the predominance of -
intellect, perishes. At last, his egoism disappears. Then, only the
Self, which is Truth, Knowledge, and Bliss, remains.
Remedy:—(1) Superiority complex, leads to pride. So a
striver, instead of finding fault with others, should find fault
with himself, and try to get rid of his faults. -
(2) A striver, should realize that the same soul pervades, all
the bodies. So, he is in no way different, from other persons.
Through ignorance, taking the all-pervading soul, as confined to
the body only, he becomes one, with the body. As, by having
affinity with time, intellect and speech, he regards himself, 'I am -
here’, ‘I am wise’, 'I am a preacher’. To deny this affinity, is a
remedy, to be free from egoism.
(3) In the scriptures, the Lord has been referred to as Truth,
Consciousness (Knowledge) and Bliss. These are three names of .
the Lord. They do not denote three different entities. Keeping
the goal in view, denoted even by anyone of these three names,
a striver, can be free from all worldly thoughts. Being free from
thoughts, he can realize his automatic identity, with the Absolute |
and be free from, egoism.
(a) 'Sat' (Truth or Reality):—The Lord, had been, always has
been, and remains, forever. He, is neither born, nor destroyed.
He, neither increases nor decreases. He always, remains the same.
Reflecting this way through intellect, one can become free from |
worldly thoughts. Thus, being free from thoughts, a striver, snaps
his ties with, intellect and realizes, his axiomatic identity, with
the self. On such realization, pride goes away.
(b) 'Cit':—As 'T' is an illuminator and a body, senses etc., are
illumined, so is Knowledge Absolute the illuminator and I, thou,
"
1508,"Verse 8] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1453 :
this and that, are ilJumined.* These are quite distinct, from an
illuminator. So 'T’, thou’, 'this', and ‘that’, are quite distinct from
the oversoul. In this way, getting established in that Knowledge
Absolute, the self is realized and egoism, is destroyed. |
(c) 'Ananda' (Bliss)—Intellect, can know the Matter :
(insentient world) only. It has no access beyond it. In order to,
know the divine, it is indispensable to renounce, affinity with
intellect. Establishment of the self, in the Supreme, is a means
to renounce this affinity. Then, only the supreme in the form |
of Bliss’ remains, Who is also ‘Knowledge’ and ‘Truth’. Thus a
striver, is freed from egoism. oo
‘Janmamrtyujaravyadhiduhkhadosanudarsanam'—As a pitcher, -
is baked in a potter's kiln, a helpless child, burns within the
womb of a mother. During the process of birth, it has to bear
unbearable pain, while coming out of the womb. A striver, should _
constantly think of the trouble of pain on birth.
No one, can escape death, it is inevitable for one, who is born.
When a man under compulsion, has to leave a body, residence and -
wealth etc., which he regarded as his own, throughout life, but
he never hopes to regain, then due to attachment, he undergoes a -
lot of suffering. Moreover, when a man dies, he suffers as much
pain, as he suffers when thousands of scorpions sting him, all at
once. Thus, a striver, should perceive evil, in death.
In old age, the body and the limbs, become feeble, the man
cannot move easily. He cannot digest food. The members of his
family insult him. He is reduced, to a helpless state. He is very
much sad by memories of his glorious past. Thus, the problems
of old age, should be perceived. |
* A businessman heard that in one firm there was profit while in the
other one there was loss. Thus profit and loss are different but there is no
difference in the knowledge about the two, knowledge is the same. Similarly
'T', 'You', ""This' and ‘That' are different but their illuminator (knowledge) is
the same. In that light of knowledge all the actions in T’, 'You’, This’ and
‘That’ are performed.
"
1509,"1454 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter13
This body, is an abode of various diseases, which are very
painful. So, there should be constant perception of troubles
caused by diseases. :
By perceiving evil in them, he should think, that they are :
a result of his past sins and evil actions. By thinking so, he
develops dispassion for the perishable things, objects and bodies
etc. It means, that perception of evil in life, death, old age and
disease etc., leads to dispassion, because attachment to sensual
pleasures 1.e., contact with these Gunas (Qualities or modes) is
responsible for birth of a soul, in good and evil wombs ((Gita .
13/21) and rebirth, is an abode of pain (Gita 8/15). Te
Affinity with Matter (Nature), and attaching importance
to it, is the root of all evils. The soul being a portion of |
the Lord, is pure by nature while evils are impure. So these
belong to two different classes. Thus, an embodied soul, is -
oppressed by evils which are his own creation. It is also
declared, in the Manasa, that the soul is sentient, pure and ;
naturally a lot of bliss (Manasa 7/117/1). So evils and pains,
are not pleasing. But, by identifying itself, with a body, it
always suffers. Therefore, the Lord emphasizes, to wipe out
the assumption of identity of the self, with a body, by viewing
evil in birth and death etc.
Appendix—One is “‘bhoga’ of sufferings, while the other is |
the effect of sufferings. To feel sad in sufferings and to desire
pleasure is ‘bhoga’ of sufferings and by finding out the cause of
suffering, to wipe it (the cause) out, is the influence of sorrow.
Here the effect of sorrow has been expressed by the expression
‘duhkhadosanudarsanam’ . |
By being sad in suffering, discrimination disappears. But
because of the influence of suffering, discrimination does not
disappear but by applying his discrimination, a man discovers the
reason for suffering and then wipes out the cause of suffering.
Desire for pleasure is the root of all sufferings. When the root
"
1510,"Verse 9] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1455 .
is weeded out, its effect is naturally wiped out; therefore when
the desire for pleasure is wiped out, all sorrows get destroyed.

nityam ca samacittatvamistanistopapattisu

Non-attachment, non-identification of the self with son, wife,
home and the like and equanimity in all desirable and undesirable,
happenings. 9 -
Comment:—

'Asakti'— Attachment to perishable worldly objects, persons and
circumstances etc., is ‘Sakti’. Absence of that attachment is called, _
'Asakti'. A man, is attached to them, to seek pleasure, from them.

He feels pleasure, while there is contact. But real joy, reveals itself,
with termination of the contact (Gita 6/23). So, it is indispensable -
to renounce, attachment for the mundane for a striver.

Remedy:—Pleasure, which is derived from the contact of -
senses, with their objects, seems lke nectar at first, but is like
poison in the end (Gita 18/38). One, who enjoys pleasures born
of contact, has to bear suffering. So, by thinking of their result a
striver, is not attached to them. |

‘Anabhisvangah putradaragrhadisu'—Close association with
one's sons, wife, house, wealth and cattle etc., is really assumed.

A man, is so much identified* with them, that he regards their
sickness and death etc., as his own. So, a man should not identify
himself, with them.

Remedy:—Render service, to your kith and kin, without
expecting any service or reward in return. If they take pleasure, in

* Proper dealings and rendering of service to sons and wife is not
identification, it is rather non-attachment which leads to immortality.
"
1511,"1456 | SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter13
serving you, accept their service, without deriving any pleasure,
out of it. |
‘Nityarh ca samacittatvamistanistopapattisu'—Absence of joy
and attachment, in the favourable circumstances and absence of ;
grief and aversion, in unfavourable circumstances, is equanimity.
In that state a striver, remains unaffected by all desirable and
undesirable, happenings. In 2/48, the Lord has called it ‘Equanimity'
(Evenness of mind), in success and failure. |
Remedy:—A striver, should utilize desirable happenings
and circumstances, to render service to the beings of the world, So
without any selfish motive. Similarly, in undesirable happenings -
and circumstances, he should renounce the desire to receive
favourable circumstances. He, should feel, neither happy in
agreeable circumstances, nor sad, in disagreeable ones. _
He should have a firm belief, that the desirable, as well as
the undesirable circumstances, are a méans*‘to realize God. So,
he has to transcend these and thus a striver attains equanimity.

Unswerving devotion to Me with sole dependence on
God, inclination for solitary places, and dislike for the
worldly people. 10
Comment:— : .
""Mayi cdnanyayogena bhaktiravyabhicarini'—Having
dependence, on the world a striver's body-consciousness, remains
intact. This 'ego' is the main hurdle to Self-realization. To remove
this hurdle the Lord, declares that exclusive devotion is a means to
Self-realization. In simple words it means, that through devotion,
"
1512,"Verse 10] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1457 -
ego is easily wiped out. Total dependence only on Him and His
grace, is called wholehearted discipline. |
Having consummate and unadulterated love for God, is
unswerving devotion to Him. It means, that He is both the |
means and the end. This is unswerving devotion with whole-
hearted, devotion. |
A striver, following the discipline of Knowledge also, having
an aptitude for devotion, by depending on the Lord, attains, Self-
realization. The Lord, mentioned this unswerving devotion, as a
means to transcend the three Gunas—(qualities) (Gita 14/26). -
Doubt:—Here, the Lord has mentioned devotion, as a means : _
for Self-realization, while in the fifty-fourth and fifty-fifth verses
of the eighteenth chapter, He refers to knowledge, as a means
to attain devotion, why? -
Answer:—Devotion, 1s of two kinds—as a means, and as
an end; so is knowledge of two kinds—as a means and as an
end. Both, in the end, are one and the same, like the two faces
of the same coin. In the end, both (as means) are methods to
attain devotion and knowledge, (as an end). Therefore, both .
the statements—devotion, as the means for Self-realization
and knowledge, as the means to attain devotion, are justified.
Therefore, a striver, according to his past and present propensities,
should follow anyone of the Discipline of Action, Knowledge
or Devotion. He, should be very cautious, that His only aim is
God-realization, not. the world. With this aim, he attains God,
with his own discipline. |
Doubt:—Why has the Lord mentioned His devotion, as a
virtue, which makes for Jiiana (wisdom)? Does a striver, following
the Discipline of Knowledge, practise devotion? |
Answer:—Strivers following the Discipline of Knowledge, are
of two kinds—those having predominance of feelings (devotion),
and others having predominance of knowledge.
(1) The striver who has predominance of devotion, wants to
"
1513,"1458 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 13
know the reality, by depending upon God (7/6; 13/18). The terms
‘Mam’ (Me) and 'Mama' (My), in the second verse; Me (from
Me) in the third verse; 'Mayi' (to Me) in this tenth verse and
‘Madbhaktah' (My devotee) and 'Madbhavaya’' (to My being) in the
eighteenth verse of this chapter, denote that upto the eighteenth
verse, it is related to a striver, in whom devotion predominates.
But, from the nineteenth to the thirty-fourth verses, no such word
as 'T', ‘Me’, or 'My' etc., has been used, which indicates that, it
describes a striver, in whom knowledge predominates. So here, |
devotion is a means for Self-realization. So
Further, as butter or milk, with other ingredients of sattvika -
food, or alone, promotes strength and health, similarly devotion
to the Lord, with the Discipline of Knowledge, or alone, makes |
a striver eligible for God-realization and by itself also induces -
him, to transcend the three modes (Gita 14/26). According to
Sri Pataiijali, devotion is one of the eight yogic practices, and an
_ independent means for God-realization. Thus devotion, occupies :
an important place, even in the Discipline of Knowledge. |
_ (2) A striver, having predominance of knowledge, is one, ”
who endowed with discrimination and dispassion, distinguishing
the real (spirit) from the unreal (Matter), wants to know the
truth (Gita 13/19—34).
Today, because of excessive attachment to sensual pleasures,
a striver, following the Discipline of Knowledge is rare, indeed.
So the Discipline of Devotion, is very useful for them. Thus,
here the description of devotion is appropriate and reasonable. .
Remedy:—By having affinity, with the Lord and depending |
on Him, utterance of His name, loud chanting, meditation and
adoration etc., are easy means, to develop devotion, for Him.
'ViviktadeSasevitvam'—A lonely and holy place, free from
hustle, bustle and disturbances, is suitable for meditation,
adoration, study of sacred books and other spiritual practices.
So, it is proper for a striver, to carry on his spiritual practice for
"
1514,"Verse 11] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1459 -
God-realization, in a lonely woodland or temple etc. But if he
is unable to find such a lonely and holy place, he need not lose
heart, in the least. He should realize, that he (Spirit) is different
from the body (Matter). Even in a lonely woodland or temple
or the bank of the Ganges, if he identifies himself with body, -
it means that he identifies himself with the world and, so there
is not much use of a lonely place.
Real loneliness is that state in which the striver beholds
nothing else, but the Lord or the self, and he realizes that he
has no identity with the body, mind and senses etc., because -
these are evolutes of matter, while the self (Spirit), transcends en
matter (nature).
‘Aratirjanasamsadi'—A striver, should have no inclination 7
for worldly affairs. If anybody wants to discuss with us spiritual _
subjects, the desire to meet him is not, 'Aratirjanasamsadi’. The
company of men, attached to worldly enjoyment, is an obstacle
to spiritual life, while the company of saints, exalted souls and ©
strivers for God-realization, is helpful to spiritual practice. So,
-the former, not the latter, should be disliked and discarded,
the latter is indispensable for spiritual progress. It has been

said—a man should not keep company with attachment, but if
detachment is not possible, he should keep company of noble

persons, because, their company, is a good remedy for attachment.

By their company, a striver develops detachment.

adhyatmajnananityatvam tattvajnanarthadarsanam

etajjianamiti proktamajianam  =jyadato'nyatha

Constancy, in the knowledge of the Supreme Spirit, in
seeing God everywhere as the object of true knowledge—all
"
1515,"1460 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter13
this is declared to be knowledge (jana), and what is contrary

to it, is called ignorance (ajfiana). 11

Comment:—

'Adhyatmajiiananityatvam'—All scriptures direct men towards -
God. With this point in view, a striver should dwell upon God
to the best of his understanding. From arguments and counter
arguments it is proved, that God exists at all times, while the
world does not exist, at anytime. Every moment it is decaying.

The Self or the Supreme Spirit, is eternal and imperishable, while .

the world is transitory, perishable and is subject to modifications. Se
The world, actually has no existence of its own, besides the Lord. -

The world, appears to exist, in the light of the Self or God. Thus,

to dwell upon the negation of independent existence of the world,

and ever-existence of God, is 'Adhyatmajfiananityatvam’. -

Remedy:—Study of the sacred texts, listening to the divine
discourses, and inquiries, constitute the remedy. .

'Tattvajiianarthadarsanam'—'Tattvajnana’ means, God.
Constantly beholding Him, pervading everywhere is 'seeing God, .
as an object of true’ knowledge. A striver, should behold nothing
else, besides the Lord, as He pervades everywhere, everytime,
every person, thing, incident or circumstance. To have such a
constant perception, is ""Tattvajfianarthadarsanam'.

'Etajjiianamiti proktamajiianam yadato'nyatha'—The twenty
virtues, mentioned from 'Amanitvam' (absence of pride) in the
seventh verse to ‘Tattvajnanarthadarsanam' (beholding the |
Lord) in this verse, are all conducive to God-realization by
wiping out a striver's identification, with the body. So these
have been named, (true) knowledge. The opposites of these
virtues are—pride, hypocrisy and violence etc. Such wicked
propensities, are conducive to disinclination for God-realization,
as well as, identification of the self, with a body. So they are
named, ignvrance.
"
1516,"Verse 11] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1461 7

If a striver, by developing acute discrimination, can renounce
his assumed affinity with a body, all these virtues get naturally ;
revealed, in him. Then he need not inculcate separate virtues, Oo
in him. A striver, should know the distinction between the real
(Spirit), and the unreal (body). By knowing this distinction, his
assumed affinity with body, is renounced. Secondly, he should — |
have only an aim for God-realization.

This is everybody's experience that the body has changed BS
but ‘I’ remain the same and implication of the body with the -
Self is not real but a false notion. Only by having this belief,
his spiritual practice begins. The aim for God-realization arouses
discrimination, which leads to dispassion. The Lord, has described _
these twenty virtues, to strengthen discrimination, and dispassion.

With this aim, the evils are rooted out, whether a striver, realizes

it or not. As leaves, on the branches of a tree, even when rooted -
out, remain green for a few days, so the evils of a striver, are

rooted out, as soon as he fixes his goal, to realize God. In the .

beginning a striver, does not realize this fact, because evils

appear in him. But gradually he realizes, that he is free from

all those, evils. |

During spiritual practice, a striver sometimes feels the presence
of evils, in him. Actually, at that time, the evils make their
exit. During spiritual practice, if the number of evil propensities
increases, it means, that these are making their entry. But, if they |
are decreasing, it means that they are making their exit, and so
they will vanish, altogether. Under such circumstances, a striver
should not lose heart, he should be whole-heartedly engaged, in
spiritual practice. By doing so, all his evils, totally disappear.

Appendix—These twenty virtues have been called ‘Jnana’
(wisdom) because they enable us to know the difference between
‘ksetra’ and ‘ksetrajiia’. Whatever opposite to it is ‘Ajnana’
"
1517,"1462 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 13 -
(ignorance). Without following the spiritual. discipline (these
virtues), a man may learn facts pertaining to knowledge but
he can’t realize the reality. Therefore without spiritual practice,
ignorance (to perceive ‘ksetra’ and ‘ksetrajia’ alike) prevails, /
and so long as ignorance prevails, if a man having learnt the
difference between ‘ksetra’ and ‘ksetrajna’, discusses it, then in
fact he strengthens ‘dehabhimana’ (identification of the Self with
the body). But he who practises these virtues, he becomes able |
to distinguish between ‘ksetra’ and ‘ksetrajna’.
Link:—The Lord in the next verse, describes that the Knowable ;
Who, ought to be known. |

Who is without beginning and Who is said to be, neither existent
nor non-existent. 12
Comment:—
_ ‘'SJiieyam yattatpravaksyami'—The Lord, promises that He will
describe at length that Brahma or God, for Whose realization this
human body has been bestowed, and Who has been described |
in the scriptures.
By the term ‘Jneyam' He means that having known all other
subjects, sciences and arts of the world, something else remains,
* In this verse the Lord by the term ‘Pravaksyami' made a promise to
describe that which is to be known; by 'AmrtamaSsnute’ the result of that
knowledge, by 'Anadimat', its mark, by 'Parama Brahma’ its (His) name and
by ‘Na sattannasaducyate’ its (His) description have been given.
"
1518,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1463 :
to be known. Moreover, worldly knowledge cannot make one

free from the cycle of birth and death. But, by knowing God,

nothing else remains to be known, and the cycle of birth and

death, also comes to an end. Therefore, in the world, there is -
nothing worth knowing, except God. 7

""Yajjnatvamrtamasnute'—By knowing God, one attains
immortality, and then nothing remains to be known, to be done
and to be acquired.

In fact, a man (self) is immortal, but by assuming his identity .
with a body, he regards the death and birth of the body, as his ee es en
own birth and death. By knowing the Lord, this error is rectified, -
and he realizes the self or his immortality.

‘Anadimat'—The entire universe, emanates from the Lord,
remains established in Him, and merges in Him, while He remains -
the same. So He is called, without beginning. -

‘Param brahma'—Prakrti (matter), as well as Veda is called .
Brahma, but 'Parama Brahma’, is the Absolute, formless Brahma,
or God Who is all-pervading and ever remains, the same. None
is superior to Him in pervasiveness, purity and eternity. He is :
called 'Parama Brahma’.

‘Na sattannasaducyate'—God, cannot be called, either existent
or non-existent. He cannot be called existent, because something |
can be existent, in relativity with something else, which is non-
existent. The word day, is used only in relation with, night. But,
if there is no night, a day cannot be called, a day. He cannot be
called non-existent, because He surely exists. The fact is, that :
words cannot describe the real character of God, either by the ;
positive or negative method. As the sun, is different from both
the night and the day, so is God different from, both, the existent
(Sat) and the non-existent (Asat). ‘Sat’ or 'Asat' is determined
through intellect. This is 'Sat' and that is 'Asat'—it is in the realm
of the world, which is a subject of mind, speech and intellect.

But, He is beyond, not only of speech, but also of mind and
"
1519,"1464. SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 13
intellect. So He cannot be called, either existent (being) or non-
existent (non-being). | |

Appendix—God has been called ‘Jiieya’ because He is to :
be known, he should be known and He can be known. In fact :
He is not to be known with the help of Prakrti bacause Prakrti
can’t' have an access to Him as He transcends Prakrti. But He
can be known by the Self.

Prakrti (matter) and Purusa (the Self)—both have been
called eternal (Gita 13/19); therefore being the master of the |
two, God has been called here ‘anadimat’.* In the fourth and fifth ee
verses of the seventh chapter the Lord, having stated the ‘apara -
prakrti’ as ‘ittyarn me’ and ‘para prakrti’ (soul) as ‘me param’,
has mentioned that both are dependent upon Him; therefore the
master of the two is only God. -

In the Upanisad it is mentioned—
ksaram pradhanamamrtaksaram harah ksaratménavisate deva ekah’ -

(SvetaSvatara. 1/10)

Prakrti is perishable (kaleidoscopic) and its enjoyer, Purusa
(the soul), is immortal, imperishable (unchangeable). God keeps -
these two (prakrti and purusa) under His control.

In the Gita entire-God has been described in three ways—

(1) God is real (existent) and also unreal (non- |
existent)}—‘sadasaccaham’ (9/19). :

(ii) God is real, also unreal and is also beyond the
two—‘sadasattatparam yat’ (11/37).

(ii1) God is neither real nor unreal—‘na sattannasaducyate’ /
(13/12).

It means that in fact there is nothing else besides God. He
is totally beyond the access of mind, intellect and speech, so He

* ‘Anadimatparath brahma’—This expression may also mean
‘anadi, matpararm brahma’ viz., brahma depends on Me—‘brahmano hi
pratisthaham’ (Gita 14/27).
"
1520,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1465 .
cannot be described but He can be attained.

In fact God cannot be described in words. But He is called
real in relativity with the unreal, immutable in relativity with
the mutable and omnipresent in relativity with the unipresent -
but in fact the terms real, immutable and omnipresent are not
applicable to Him. The reason is that all the terms are used in
relativity and in having affinity with Prakrti; but the Divinity is
independent and transcends Prakrti. A name is given in relation
to space, time, thing, person, state and quality etc. God transcends |
all limits of space and time etc., then how can He be addressed
by particular names? Therefore it is mentioned here that God -
can’t be called either real (existent) or unreal (non-existent).

There is no beginning of God. How can there be the beginning |
of God Who is eternal viz., from time immemorial? All are within -
limits but He is beyond limits. He is neither real nor unreal.

With beginning-beginningless, within limits and beyond limits,

real and unreal—these differences are there because of affinity
with Prakrti. The Supreme Reality transcends all restrictions such

as with beginning-beginningless, within limits and beyond limits :
and real and unreal. Thus whatever has been said about the
description of God, Who is to be known, is in fact no description

but it is to draw attention towards the aim. It means that God 1s |
not merely to be described but this description draws a striver’s
attention towards the knowable. Therefore a striver should not

merely learn facts but should reflect upon them with a view to

have an insight into it. | ,

Link—In the preceding verse, Lord Krsna described the
attributeless-formless Brahma, the Absolute, Who is worth knowing,
by saying that He is neither existent nor non-existent. In the next
verse, He describes the reality of what is worth knowing (Jneya)
viz., God as formless and endowed with attributes.

sarvatahpanipadam tatsarvato'ksisiromukham

sarvatahsrutimalloke sarvamavrtya tisthati :

With hands and feet all over, with eyes, hands, mouth and
with ears everywhere, He stands pervading all. 13
Comment:—

'‘Sarvatahpanipadam tat'—As there are, various scripts in ink
and various ornaments in gold, the Lord has His hands and feet Se
everywhere. Therefore, He accepts all offerings from all quarters -
made to Him physically, or mentally. Moreover, His hands are
ever ready to protect devotees, from all the dangers everywhere. :
He has his feet everywhere, and so he accepts the sandal-paste, _
flowers and prostrations etc., offered by devotees, according to
their feelings. If thousands and lacs of devotees, adore the Lord's
feet, separately at a time, the Lord's feet are present then and
there, according to the sentiments of devotees.

'Sarvato'ksiSiromukham'—Wherever, devotees wave lamp .
to God and offer homage to Him with kindled lamps, there are
God's eyes to see these. He has eyes, everywhere. It means, that
no activities are hidden from Him. He beholds the devotees,
wherever they perform actions, such as a dance, meditation, |
prayer and various spiritual practices. It means, that he who
beholds the Lord, present everywhere, He is never out of his
sight (Gita 6/30).

He has His head everywhere and therefore, sandal-paste and
flowers etc., offered to Him, as a mark of reverence, reach His .
head. Having His mouth everywhere, He accepts the articles of
food offered by His devotees, everywhere (Gita 9/26).

'Sarvatahsrutimat'—The Lord, hears the loud, slow and silent
(mental) prayer, of His devotees.

The Lord, unlike men has all His limbs, everywhere. It
"
1522,"Verse 13] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1467 -
means, he can hear, speak or accept the articles offered, with

His eyes. Similarly, He can perform all actions with anyone of

his sense-organs. He has all the sense-organs, in each of the
smallest limbs. |

By this statement, that He has His limbs everywhere, He means
that he pervades all the time, all places, persons, incidents and
circumstances etc. So He is not away, from anyone, He is close
at hand, for everyone. Saints, have also declared, the same.

As a man, leading a mundane life, beholds the universe
everywhere, a devout devotee, beholds the Lord, pervading BS
everywhere. -

'Loke sarvamavrtya tisthati'i—The Lord, stands pervading
the infinite universes, because, in the forty-second verse of the
tenth chapter also, He declares that He stands, holding the entire _
universe, with a single fragment of His.

Appendix—In God everywhere there is everything. As in a
pen and ink, which script is not there? A man having knowledge ,
of different scripts can write them with the same pen and ink.

In a lump of gold, which ornament is not present? A goldsmith :
out of that lump prepares several ornaments such as bangles,
necklaces and nose rings etc., similarly in iron which arm or
weapon or instrument is not there? Which idol is not present in
clay and stone? Similarly in God what is not there? The entire
universe is born of God, stays in Him and at last merges into
Him. When He is at the beginning, He is at the end, then Who
else can be there in the mid-state? If a striver accepts this fact
firmly that God pervades everywhere, God will be seen to him
because only He exists, there is no other existence besides Him.
The Lord declares— | |
ahamevasamevagre nanyad yat sadasat param

pascadaham yadetacca yo’vasisyeta so’smyaham

(Srimadbha. 2/9/32)

‘I was present before the universe was created, there was

nothing else besides Me; and after the creation whatever the
world appears, that is also I. The real, the unreal and any other
entity which can be imagined beyond the real and the unreal,
that is also I. If there is anything else besides the creation that is
also I; and at the destruction of the creation, whatever remains, :
that is also I.’

It means that there is only one existence and that is not realized
because we remain entangled in the pairs of opposites.

sarvendriyagunabhasam sarvendriyavivarjitam

asaktam sarvabhrccaiva nirgunam gunabhoktr ca

He (God), though without all senses, is the perceiver of all
sense-objects, unattached yet sustains all, unpossessive of gunas
(attributes), yet enjoys them. 14
Comment:—

'Sarvendriyagunabhasam sarvendriyavivarjitam'—There is
pre-existence of God; then there is His power, prakrti (matter).
The evolute of matter is Mahattattva (Cosmic intelligence), an
evolute of cosmic intelligence, is cosmic ego, and the evolutes
of ego, are five gross elements, while the evolutes of five gross :
elements, are mind and ten senses. The evolutes of ten senses,
are five objects of senses—all these are the evolutes of cosmic
Nature. But God transcends, prakrti and its evolutes, whether
He is attributeless or endowed with attributes, whether He is
formless, or with form. He transcends prakrti, even when He
"
1524,"Verse 14] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1469 :
incarnates. In that case, He manifests Himself, keeping prakrti
under His control. *

How can God, be bound by gunas (modes) (attributes),
when even an embodied soul, by attaining God transcends :
gunas? He is ever transcendent in character, He has no hands, “
feet, eyes etc., like other living beings, but He is capable of
perceiving the objects of senses.* He listens to the call of His
devotees, even without ears, embraces His devotees without skin,
beholds beings without eyes, tastes articles of food, offered by
His devotees, without tongue, runs to help His devotees, without .
feet and so on. | ae

'Asaktam sarvabhrccaiva'—God loves, all beings, without -
having attachment for them, unlike worldly parents, who support
their family with attachment, He supports and nourishes all the
beings, throughout the entire universe, either on the earth, in ~
the ocean or in ether or in heaven, in a better way without any
attachment and provides necessities for them. Being a disinterested
friend, He purifies all of them, destroying their good deeds and
sins, through favourable and unfavourable, circumstances.

‘Nirgunam gunabhoktr ca'—Though God 1s devoid of gunas, oo
yet He enjoys. It means, that the Lord is pleased seeing all |
the actions performed, by His devotees, in the same way, as
parents are pleased seeing activities of their children and thus
He is an enjoyer.

Appendix—In spite of the predominance of Brahma (the
Absolute) in this topic, now in this verse there is the description
of entire God. This entire form is the Reality to be known.
Therefore there is the predominance of the entire form both
in knowledge and devotion—‘Vasudevah sarvam’ (Gita 7/19),

‘sarvamn khalvidarh brahma’ (Chandogya. 3/14/1).

This verse means that there is no other existence at all

* He (God) grasps and rapidly moves without hands and feet; He sees
without eyes and hears without ears (Manasa 1/118/3-4).

Comment:— : | |
[In the six verses, from the twelfth to the seventeenth, there is
a description of the Knowable. Out of those six verses, this is the -
fourth verse which also includes the idea of the preceding three
verses, and the next two verses. Therefore, this verse contains a |
gist of the topic of, the Knowable.]
_ 'Bahirantasca bhitanamacaram carameva ca'—In a block of ;
ice, immersed in the sea, there is water within and without and
there is nothing else, besides water. Similarly all the moving
and unmoving beings, are pervaded, both inside and outside by
God. It means, that the entire moving and unmoving creation, is
nothing else besides, God. The same, has been described by the
Lord, from the angle of a realized soul as, 'Vasudevah sarvam'
and from His angle He is describing 'Sadasaccaham’. Thus, the .
experience of God and of realized souls, is the same.
'Diirastham cantike ca tat'—-A thing can be near or far,
from three view-points—space, time and thing. God, is nearest
as well as, farthest, from all the three view-points. He pervades
everywhere, is close at hand and afar too.* He existed in the
* Water is far from the earth, fire is far from water, air is far from fire,
ether is far from air, cosmic intelligence is far from ether, Matter (Prakrti)

1526,"Verse 15] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 147] -
past, exists now, and will exist, in future; He existed before, all

things came into existence, He will exist, when the things perish

and He exists now, in the form of things. Though the Lord, is

the nearest, yet He is far away, from. those who hanker after

worldly pleasures.and prosperity. But, He is the nearest for those, .
who have an inclination for Him. So a striver, renouncing the

desire for pleasures and prosperity, should arouse a yearning,

only for God-realization. By doing so, he will realize his eternal :
union, with God.

'‘Siksmatvattadavijfieyam'—God, being subtle, is beyond ~ -
senses and mind. He cannot be known, through senses and | SO
mind, by people. Now, a question arises that, when he cannot
be known, he must be non-existent. But, He is not a naught. As
molecules of water, existing in the sky are not seen, but they -
are perceived in the form of rain, or hail, God being subtler,
than molecules of water, is incomprehensible, by senses, mind
and intellect etc. : ,

People do not know God, because of their ignorance. As
an illiterate person cannot read the word ‘Gita’, but a learned -
person in Sarnskrta, can read the word, and know its contents,
and one who is well-versed in the Gita, its deep thoughts come
to his mind. Similarly, an ignorant person cannot know God,
but one who has known Him, in reality, beholds nothing else,
besides Him. |

God is worth-knowing (13/12, 17). He can be known by the
self, so he is called 'Jiieya’, but He cannot be known, by senses,
mind and intellect, so He is called 'Avijiieya’. In order to know ,
is far from cosmic intelligence and God (Paramatma) is far from Matter. Thus
God is the farthest: Though He is the farthest, yet He pervades all because He
is their cause, all are born of Him.

Gross body is nearer than Matter (Prakrti); subtle body is nearer than the
gross body; causal body is nearer than the subtle body; ego is nearer than the
causal body; God is nearer than ego. Thus God is the nearest.
"
1527,"1472 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter.13 .
Him, a striver, should believe that He pervades everywhere. By
having this belief, he will be able to behold Him, everywhere
because He in reality exists, everywhere. This belief (assumption)
is, also a discipline. It has its own glory, and will lead to God-
realization. | ae

Appendix—In the twelfth verse, God has been called ‘Jiteya’
(worth knowing). But in this verse He has been called “Avijiieya’
(can’t be known) which means that God is not known like the
world. As the world is known through senses, mind and intellect,

God in not known through senses, mind and intellect. Senses, BS
mind and intellect are the evolutes of Prakrti while God is beyond -
Prakrti. The evolutes of Prakrti can’t know even Prakrti completely,
then how can they know God Who transcends prakrt1? One has
to accept the existence of God by faith in Him. As acceptance is _
done by the Self itself, not by sense-organs etc., (mind, intellect
and senses).* The Self has its identity with God, therefore God
is also attained by acceptance, not by thinking, reflection and
description. The Self has never been identified with the body
and the world, nor is identified, nor will be identified nor can
be identified. The Self has neither been, nor is, nor will be nor
can be separate from God. |

Comment:—
'Avibhaktam ca bhiitesu vibhaktamiva ca sthitam'— Actually,
there is one indivisible existence, (God) pervading in all diverse “
forms. Division, is a mere appearance. Just as space, though
really one and indivisible, appears divided into innumerable
forms; so God though really undivided, seems to be spread over
beings. In the twenty-seventh verse of this chapter also, the Lord
declares, ""A seer beholds the Supreme Lord, abiding equally in |
all perishable beings."" Similarly, in the twentieth verse of the So
eighteenth chapter also, while describing Sattvika knowledge, :
He declares, ""The knowledge by which the one Imperishable
Being, is seen in all existences is Sattvika."" |
'Bhitabhartr ca tajjiieyarn grasisnu prabhavisnu ca'—The -
Almighty God, Who should be known (13/2) and Who is
worth knowing (13/12) has been described as the sustainer (Lord
Visnu), the destroyer (Lord Siva) and creator (Lord Brahma).
The same Lord, as Brahma with the predominance of 'rajoguna’
(activity) creates the universe, as Visnu with the predominance -
of 'sattvaguna' sustains it and as Siva with the predominance of
‘tamoguna’' destroys it, yet He remains untainted by these gunas
(modes) having full control over them.
Appendix—In this verse there is the description of the entire
form of God. As the world from the material point of view is
one, so is also the Real Entity (God) one and undivided. As
the world consisting of the five elements, in spite of being one,
appears in the form of different objects, persons (insentient-sentient,
unmoving-moving) etc., similarly God in spite of being one,
appears in different forms. It means that God in spite of being
one, exists in several forms; and in spite of existing in several —
forms, is one. The Real Entity can never be two because if they
are two, it means that the unreal is included in it.

Link:—In the previous verse, the Lord said that He who is
worth knowing, is the creator, sustainer and destroyer of the
entire universe. In the next verse, it is explained that He is the
light of all lights.

That supreme soul is said to be, the light of all lights, entirely -
beyond darkness (ignorance). He is knowledge (jana), the
knowable (jfeya) the goal of knowledge and is vested in the hearts
of all. 17
Comment:—
'Jyotisimapi tajjyotih'—The sun, the moon, the stars, fire -
and electricity, are illuminators (light), of physical objects. The
five sense-organs—ear, eye, skin, tongue and nose are, the
illuminators (light) of sound, sight (colour), touch, taste and
smell. The sense-organs can perceive the objects of sense, if the
mind, remains with them. So mind, is the light (illuminator) of
senses. Similarly, intellect is the light of the mind, as it guides
and distinguishes, the real from the unreal. Self is the light of
the intellect, because if a man does not attach importance, to |
the real and does not translate reality into practice, there 1s not
much utility, of intellectual knowledge. The self is a fragment
of the Lord, and so He is the light (Illuminator), of the self.
So He is the light of all lights, and is self-effulgent but He is
illuminated by, none. :
As an examinee, can see other examinees who are sitting
"
1530,"Verse 17] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1475 -
on the front benches, but cannot see those, who are sitting at
his back, similarly ego and intellect etc., can perceive mind and
senses etc., but cannot perceive God, Who sees all of them,
Who is their illuminator and Who is not illuminated by, anyone.
He equally illuminates the entire world, moving or unmoving
(Srimadbha. 10/113/55). In Him, there is no trio of an illuminator,
illumination and the illumined. |

'Tamasah paramucyate'—The Supreme Lord, is entirely beyond
darkness or ignorance. It means, that He is totally untainted
and detached. Senses, mind, intellect and ego, can be tainted by °
ignorance and knowledge, but He is beyond ignorance, in the oo |
same way as, the sun is beyond the reach of darkness. |

'‘Jiianam jiieyarn jidanagamyam'—God is knowledge Himself,
free from ignorance. All beings, receive knowledge from Him. -
He is worth knowing (knowable), because nothing remains to
be known, after knowing him. Worldly knowledge, is no doubt
useful, but it is not a must, as it is not perfect in itself. After .
possessing it, something else remains, to be known. In fact, it
is only the Lord, who is to be known certainly. Lord Krsna, in
the fifteenth chapter, declares, ""I am worth knowing through the :
Vedas"" (15/15) and ""He who knows Me, knows all” (Gita 15/19).

Virtues, such as absence of pride, freedom from hypocrisy,
and non-violence etc., which have been described, from the |
seventh verse to the eleventh verse of this chapter, have been
declared to be (true) knowledge. By that knowledge, renouncing
the unreal, the Lord, can be known in reality. So the Lord has
been called the goal to be attained by this knowledge.

'Hrdi sarvasya visthitam'—Though God pervades everywhere,
He is particularly seated, in the hearts of all.

How to realize the presence of God in the heart?

(1) A striver, should realize the difference between, the
real and the unreal. He should know, that there are different
states, such as wakefulness, sleep, and sound sleep; childhood,
"
1531,"1476 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 13 7
youth and old age, but he himself remains, the same. Pleasant

and painful, favourable and unfavourable circumstances, appear

and disappear, but he remains the same. There 1s contact, with
things, persons etc., and then there is separation, from these, but .
he remains the same. It means that he is different from, all of
them. By knowing this truth in reality, he will realize the presence

of God in his heart, because he himself, being a fraction of the
Lord, has identity with Him.

(2) As a starving person, becomes uneasy without food and |
a thirsty man without water, a striver, should become uneasy Se
for God-realization. Then, he will realize that He is seated in -
his heart. By this realization, he will understand that God is |
all-pervading. This 1s true realization.

Appendix—The Knowable entity, which has been described -
from the twelfth verse to the seventh verse, 1s only the entire form
of God (‘Vasudevah sarvam’). The reason is that in it attributeless-
formless (twelfth verse), God endowed with attributes—formless /
(thirteenth verse) and God endowed with attributes and
form (sixteenth verse) all the three have been described. -

‘Jianagamyam’—God can be known by spiritual realization,
not by actions and objects etc. There is no other method besides
spiritual realization to know Him. A man may know God by any
spiritual discipline such as Karmayoga, Jnanayoga, Dhyanayoga
etc., in fact He will be known only by Spiritual realization. If
He is known by faith, belief, devotion and God’s grace etc.,
then also He is known by Spiritual realization only. The reason
is that ‘knowing’ is done by knowledge.

Here the term ‘jianagamyam’ may also mean that He is
attained by twenty virtues which have been mentioned from the
seventh verse to the eleventh verse of this chapter.

Comment:— .
[In the third verse, Lord Krsna ordered Arjuna to hear from
Him, what the Ksetra is, what it is like, what its modifications
are, and whence is what. Out of these four, the first and the third
were, described in the fifth and the sixth verses, respectively. The
second, will be described in the twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh
verses. Now, while describing 'Whence is what' He says that all
modifications and gunas are born of prakrti. Modifications were
described, in the sixth verse. Here in this verse, He explains that
gunas are born of prakrti—this is something new. :
From the twelfth to eighteenth verses, there is a description
of the knowable (God), while here, from the nineteenth to the
thirty-fourth verses, there is a description of 'Purusa’ (Ksetrajfia).
There, all are mentioned to be within God, while here all are
mentioned to be within spirit. It means, that essentially God and
individual spirit, are not two, but only one.} ;
"
1534,"Verse 19-20] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1479 :
- ‘Prakrtirh purusarh caiva viddhyanadi ubhavapi'—The term,
‘Prakrtim’ stands for ‘Primordial Matter’, the cause of the entire
Ksetra (universe). Seven prakrti-vikrti (Five elements, ego and
cosmic intelligence) and sixteen vikrtis (ten senses, mind and .
five objects of senses)—all these are the evolutes of Matter and
Prakrti is their cause. . |
The term 'Purusam’, here stands for 'Ksetrajiia', which has been
called a knower of the Ksetra, in the first verse of this chapter.
As the spirit, being a fraction of the Lord, is without beginning,
so is Matter. But the spirit and matter, are different in other So
aspects. Matter is endowed with attributes, while the spirit is -
attributeless; Matter undergoes modifications, while the spirit,
is free from modifications, Matter is the cause of the universe,
while the spirit is the cause of nothing. There is a relationship _
of cause ‘and effect, in Matter and its evolutes while the spirit
is free from, this relationship.
The expression, 'Ubhavapi' denotes that Prakrti and Purusa, -
both are different. As both of them are beginningless the difference
between them is also eternal. .
As the terms 'Ksetra' and 'Ksetrajiah', used in the first verse
of this chapter, stand for the individual body and the individual
soul respectively. Here 'Prakrti’, stands for ‘Primordial Matter’ and -
its evolutes, while 'Purusam’' stands for all ""Ksetrajiia' (Spirit).
The term 'Viddhi’, in the second verse of this chapter, was used
to know the identity of the individual soul, with the cosmic soul
while here, points out that the two—'body’ and 'spirit’ or 'Prakrti'
(Primordial Matter) and ‘Purusa’ (spirit), are different. So the |
Lord advises Arjuna, to understand it well, that the two, are quite
different, because a common man identifies, the body with self.
'VikaramSca gunamscaiva viddhi prakrtisambhavan'—Know
the seven modifications—desire, aversion, pleasure, pain, body,
life-breath and firmness, as well as the three Gunas—sattva,
raja and tama are born of prakrti. It means, that Pursa is free
"
1535,"1480 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA _ {Chapter 13
from modifications and modes. In the seventh chapter, the Lord
mentioned the gunas to be evolved from Him, while here He

says, that these are born of ‘prakrti’. There, because of the context

of devotion, the Lord mentioned them to be evolved from Him,
and He also explained that His wonderful divine potency of His,
consisting of the three Gunas can be overcome by taking refuge,

in Him. But here, there is the context of knowledge, so the gunas

are said to be born of prakrti. A striver, should not assume his __
affinity, with them. Thus he can get rid of them.

'Karyakarana.... prakrtirucyate'—Ether, air, fire, water, earth :
and sound, touch, sight, taste, smell—these ten, are prakrti's -
evolutes. Mind, intellect, ego, ear, skin, eye, tongue, (the sense of
taste), nose, tongue (the organ of speech), hands, feet, generative
organ and anus—these thirteen are included in the term, 'Karana' -
(instruments). Prakrti alone, is the cause of activities effected by
all of them. Whatever is born, is called 'Karya’ (evolute), and the
means by which the activities are performed, is called 'Karana’' /
(instrument). These instruments are of three types—1l. Organs
of action 2. Sense-organs 3. Mind, intellect and ego. The organs
of action, are gross, the sense-organs are subtle, and the mind,
intellect and ego are, very subtle. The organs of action and the
sense-organs, are external instruments and mind, intellect and
ego, are internal instruments. Actions are performed by organs }
of action, while mind, intellect and ego, control the organs of
actions, as well as, sense-organs. It means, that the sense-organs
control, the organs of action, the mind controls, the sense-organs,
intellect controls, the mind and ego controls, the intellect. The
organs of action and the sense-organs do not function, without
mind, intellect and ego. When the mind is connected with sense-
organs, then the sense-objects are perceived. The intellect decides,
which sense-objects, are approved (sanctioned) and which are
improper (prohibited). Ego, controls the intellect.

Ego is of two kinds—1. Ego as Vrtti and ego, as a doer.
"
1536,"Verse 19-20] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1481
The disposition of ego, is not defective. But, when a man (the
self), identifies himself with this ego, being deluded he becomes
the doer (agent) (Gita 3/27). : OO
Cosmic intelligence, is an evolute of Prakrti, while ego is /
the evolute of intelligence, but a man by identifying himself with
the ego, becomes the master i.e., becomes a doer and an enjoyer
(Gita 13/21). However when he realizes the self, he is neither
a doer, nor an enjoyer (Gita 13/31). The performance of these
actions, have been mentioned in the Gita in several ways as ""All :
actions are performed by Nature alone” (13/29); ""All actions :
are performed by the modes of Nature” (3/27); ""The modes are .
acting on the modes"" (3/28); ""There is no agent, other than the :
modes"" (14/19); ""Senses move among the sense-objects"" (5/9)
etc. It means, that all actions performed by the external and
internal instruments, are performed by Prakrti (Nature). a
'Purusah sukhaduhkhanam....heturucyate'—It is the Purusa,
that experiences, pleasure and pain; Prakrti being insentient -
cannot experience, pleasure or pain. The Purusa, experiences
these only, by being pleased and displeased, in favourable and .
unfavourable circumstances. If he is not pleased and displeased,
in favourable and unfavourable circumstances, he can never be
an enjoyer, of pleasure and pain.
In the fourth and the fifth verses of the seventh chapter, the :
Lord has described His lower (insentient) and higher (sentient),
natures. Both natures are portions of God. So, they are naturally
flowing towards God. The embodied soul, a fragment of God,
has a natural inclination, to Him. But, being attracted by worldly .
enjoyments, he identifies himself with the body. Thus he creates
his own distinct existence (Gita 13/21). This is denoted as, ‘I am’.
It consists of two aspects—consciousness incarnate and inertness.
Pleasure and pain, affect only the inert portion (Matter or body).
But because of affinity with Matter, he assumes pleasure and pain,
in the self. He feels 'I am happy’, 'I am sad’. Thus a businessman,
"
1537,"1482 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 13 -
regards loss in business, as his own loss. Similarly, when a body
suffers from fever, he thinks that he suffers from fever. If the
self, suffered once, it would continue suffering. It means that
the self, neither suffers loss nor suffers, from fever.*
A man (spirit), wants to be emancipated from pleasure and
pain, because he assumed his identity with Matter, otherwise he
himself being a portion of the Lord, always remains the same,
without undergoing any modifications, in the form of pleasure
and pain etc. It means, that in this identification of the self, with
the body, the self has a desire for emancipation, while the body, -
has desire for worldly enjoyments. So at last, the sentient self, SO
is emancipated, rather than the inert body. -
All modifications are always in the non-self, not, in the self. :
So, to be an experiencer of pleasure and pain, is not natural, in the _
self. Being attached to the non-self, an embodied soul, becomes
the experiencer of pleasure and pain. It means, that the pure self,
can never experience pleasure and pain. The. pure self cannot have -
two contrary states, because it is always changeless, uniform and
constant. There can be two states, in the changing non-self. The _
self in spite of being uniform, having affinity with the changing
non-self, thrusts upon itself, changes and modifications, which —
take place in the non-self. This is a common experience, that
we remain the same, in pleasure and pain, we do not change.
Pleasure and pain, are different from each other, but we ever
remain, uniform. But by assuming relationship, with pleasure,
we become happy, and by assuming relationship with pain, we
become sad. In reality, we are neither happy, nor sad. |
Appendix—The Lord describes the distinction between ‘Ksetra’
and ‘Ksetrajfia’ now by the names ‘Prakrti’ and ‘Purusa’. The
description of ‘Ksetra’ and ‘Ksetrajfia’ is from the individual
point of view while that of ‘Prakrti’ and ‘Purusa’ is from the
* If a man realizes that he is the self, why should he suffer from the
fever or desire or craving?
"
1538,"Verse 19-20] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1483 _
collective point of view.

There are two divisions—one is of ‘Prakrti’ while the other
is of ‘Purusa’. The body and the world are included in the
Prakrti division while the Self and God are included in the
Purusa division. As ‘Prakrti’ and ‘Purusa’ are beginningless, °
so is the knowledge of the distinction between the two viz., |
discrimination beginningless. Therefore from the discrimination
point of view, these two divisions are totally unrelated with
each other. Prakrti is unreal, inert and embodiment of sufferings
while Purusa is truth, consciousness and embodiment of bliss. |
Prakrti is perishable, mutable and active while Purusa is Te
imperishable, immutable and actionless. With Prakrti there is -
ever disunion while with Purusa there is ever union. At the |
beginning of the Gita the Lord has described this division
between the body and its possessor by the terms—‘Sarira- ~
Sarin’, “deha-dehi’, the real and the unreal etc.* Therefore it
is very essential for every striver to understand this division
and it quickly leads to Self-realization. The reason is that
identification of the Self with the body is bondage and the
realization that the two are totally different from each other, :
is salvation.

Prakrti is God’s potency and God js its master.t From the
knowledge point of view potency and its master—both are different |
because there is change (increase and decrease) in potency but
God remains the same. But from the devotion point of view both
are one because potency can’t be separated from its possessor
viz., potency has no independent existence without its master.

In order to support the two views of knowledge and devotion,
the Lord has neither stated Prakrti as ‘endless’ nor ‘an ending
one’ but has only stated it as ‘beginningless’. The reason is

* ‘Purusa’ on the acceptance of ‘ego’ is named ‘jiva, ksetrajna, Sarin’
and “dehi’ etc.

+ ‘may4rh tu prakrtirn vidyanmayinarh tu maheSvaram’ (SvetAsvatara. 4/10).
"
1539,"1484 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 13 -
that if Prakrti is said to be endless (eternal), then the discipline
of knowledge will be refuted because from that point of view
Prakrti has no existence at all—‘nasato vidyate bhavah’ (Gita
2/16). If Prakrti is stated to be ‘an ending one’ (transient), the
principle of devotion will be refuted because from the devotion “
point of view, Prakrti being the potency of God is inseparable
with Him—‘sadasaccaham’ (Gita 9/19). If we perceive from the
real point of view, it is clear that though the nature of Prakrti is
different from that of Purusa, yet both are integral. |

In fact the form (nature) of God is ‘entire’. It is not possible :
that there is no potency in God. If God is regarded to be totally So
powerless, then God will be proved to be unipresent. In Him
power may change its form or may remain unmanifest but there |
can never be negation of power. Power abides in Him in its |
causal form, otherwise where will potency (Prakrti) abide besides -
God? Therefore here both Prakrti and Purusa have been called
‘beginningless’. 7 ;

as the cause of the experience, of pleasure and pain. The question
arises, how the Purusa, is the cause. The answer follows.

karanam = gumasango'sya §sadasadyonijanmasu

When the spirit (purusa) seated in matter (prakrti) enjoys the
modes born of prakrti (matter), attachment to the modes becomes
the cause of its birth, in good and evil bodies. 21
Comment:—

‘Purusah prakrtistho* hi bhunkte prakrtijangunan'—In

fact, the spirit is not seated in Matter (body). But because of
its identification with a body, it assumes the body as 'T’, and
‘Mine’, and is thus said to be seated in the body. Such a spirit,
experiences pleasure and pain, in agreeable and disagreeable |
circumstances. This is said by. the way that the spirit enjoys
the modes born of Matter.

As 1n a bus accident, the bus driver is held responsible for
an accident because of his attachment (responsibility) to the bus,
and so he is punished. It is because of the spirit's attachment to
the body, that it (the spirit) enjoys the fruit of action performed
by the body. If it is not attached to a body and it feels all actions Ss
to be performed by Prakrti alone, (Gita 13/29), it will not have -
to accept the fruit of actions.

‘Karanam gunasango'sya sadasadyonijanmasu'—Good wombs
are those, in which there is abundance of pleasure, while bad -
ones are those, that bear much pain. The spirit, takes birth in
good and evil wombs, because of its attachment to the modes, -
born of Prakrti.

The three modes—Sattva, Rajas and Tamas, are born of ;
Prakrti. All the worldly objects and actions, are born of the modes
of Prakrti. When the spirit attaches itself, to these modes, it has
to take birth in good or bad wombs. If it is not seated in the
body and has no feeling of ‘ness and 'Mine'ness in this body, |
but remains established in the self, it will not be an enjoyer of
pleasure and pain. It will become equanimous in pleasure and
pain i.e., will become ‘Svastha', (Gita 14/24). It can establish
a relationship with Nature, or it can get fixed in the oversoul.
It cannot merge in the non-self, because non-self (Matter) is -
perishable, while the self is eternal. Both, belong to two different
(seated in the body). Here is the context of ‘Purusa and Prakrti’. So the Purusa
is said to be seated in Prakrti. In fact the spirit is not seated m the body,
but by not realizing its situation in the self, it assumes its identification
with the body.
"
1541,"1486 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 13 -
classes. But its getting established in the oversoul, is axiomatic,

as both are of the same class. Bondage is unnatural to it, while
identity with the oversoul is natural to it. Bondage is painful to

it, while merger in the oversoul is pleasant to it.

In the ego of the self, where there is discriminative faculty, :
to know a distinction between, Prakrti and Purusa, there only
exists ignorance to assume identity, with Prakrti. By assuming
identity, this Purusa, is called 'Prakrtistha' (seated in Nature), and
the sense of 'T’ and 'mine' increases. This is attachment, to the
modes of Prakrti. This attachment binds him (Purusa) (Gita 14/5)
and therefore, he meets with destiny, according to predominance Te
of the modes, of Nature (Gita 14/18). -

Appendix—The Lord in the second half of the nineteenth
verse and in the first half of the twentieth verse has described —
‘Prakrti’, and in the second half of the twentieth verse and here -
in this verse, He has described ‘Purusa’.

Attachment to objects, persons and actions is ‘gunasanga’ -
(attachment to modes) which 1s the cause of birth and death.
Attachment to the modes is transient while detachment from the .
modes is eternal. Detachment is nature of the Self—‘asango’ hyayarh
purusah’ (Brhada 4/3/15). If we are not attached to the transient
or the modes, we.can’t follow the wheel of birth and death.

‘Tl’ is inert (non-self) (Prakrti) and ‘am’ is sentient (self) |
(Purusa) and ‘I am’—this 1s the identification of the Self with the
non-Self. In ‘I am’ there is the sense of doership and enjoyership.

If ‘I’ does not remain, then ‘am’ will not remain but ‘is’ will
persist. As there is no identification of a lump of iron with fire, so |
the lump of iron remains lying on the earth, while fire from this
hot lump of iron merges into the formless fire-element, similarly
‘ego’ perists in Prakrti and ‘am’ (being a form of ‘is’) merges
into ‘is’. In ‘is’ there is neither doership nor enjoyership. It means
that ‘am’ is attracted towards pleasures, ‘is’ is not attracted;
‘am’ becomes the doer and enjoyer, ‘1s’ does not become the
"
1542,"Verse 22] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1487 :
doer and enjoyer. Therefore a striver instead of assuming ‘am’
should assume only ‘is’ viz., he should realize it.

Everyone realizes that pleasures and pains appear and
disappear while the Self ever remains the same. Even the most :
sinful person realizes this fact. In spite of realizing this fact, a
man feels happy and sad with the fleeting pleasures and pains.

The reason is that attachment to pleasure and fear of pain do not

let him realize that he is different from pleasure and pain—this

discrimination does not work. In fact a man (the Self) does not |

feel happy and sad at all but he, identifying the Self with the eee
body, assumes himself to be happy and sad. It means that pleasure — ”
(happiness) and pain (sadness) are based on his indiscriminative

assumption only.

The Soul (Purusa) having been vested within the body is called

he assumes that he sustains the body, he is called a ‘sustainer';
as he experiences pleasure and pain, he is called ‘experiencer'; :
being the master of the body he is 'Great Lord' (MaheSvara).
Really speaking, this Purusa by his own nature is the Supreme
Soul. In spite of, His residence in the body; he is untainted and
unattached. 22

"
1543,"1488 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 13 :
Purusa (spirit), is eternal, all-pervading, immovable, constant

and everlasting (Gita 2/24). As the Purusa, observes the ‘body,

an evolute of prakrti, He becomes a witness. |

He, is the permitter, because He gives advice and permission,
in the performance of actions. |

He, by identifying himself with the individual body, sustains
the body by providing food, water and other necessities, and
protects it from cold and heat etc. So, He is the sustainer.

By identifying Himself with the body, He undergoes all sorts
of experiences. He experiences pleasure and pain, in favourable ee
and unfavourable, circumstances. So, He is the experiencer. |

He regards Himself, as the Lord of the body, senses, mind, |
intellect, wealth and property etc. So He is called the Great Lord. -

‘Paramatmeti cépyukto dehe'sminpurusah parah'—The Spirit,
dwelling in this body, is really the same, which has been termed
as the ‘Supreme Soul’, in the scriptures. In spite of its residence, -
in the body, it has no affinity with it. Though it dwells in the
body, it neither acts, nor is tainted (13/31). .

In this verse, the Spirit dwelling in the body, has been called
by different names, as a man is called by different names (such
as father, uncle, brother and grandfather etc.,) according to the
relationship it bears, though it is the same. ,

Appendix—In fact the Purusa (spirit) is transcendental
(untainted and unattached) but having relationship with others,
he becomes a witness, a permitter etc. As a man becomes a
father by having relationship with a son, he becomes a son by
bearing relationship with the father, he becomes a husband by
bearing relationship with the wife and he becomes a brother by
bearing relationship with a sister. All these relations are in order
to perform one’s duty, rather than to have the sense of mine
(possession). The real Self is totally unattached and untainted.

Here the purpose of giving several epithets such as ‘upadrasta’ So
"
1544,"Verse 23] - SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1489 -
(witness), “‘anumanta’ (permitter) etc., is to express unity that
the Self is only one. In the topic of knowledge the description

He who thus knows Purusa (Spirit) and prakrti (nature) together

he may be in), he is not born again. 23
Comment:— .
""Ya evam vetti purusam prakrtim ca gunaih saha sarvatha
vartamano'pi na sa bhiyo'bhijayate-——Here the term ‘Evam’
(thus), denotes that the Spirit is different from, the body. He
who knows this difference in reality, while performing his duty
according to his caste, creed, stage of life and circumstances
etc., is not reborn. He knows that prakrti with its evolutes,
modifications and instruments etc., which appears in the form |
of universe, is different from the Self. So he is not born again, /
because attachment to the modes of nature, is the cause of its
birth (Gita 13/21).
Here, the expression 'Sarvatha vartamano'pi' (acts in anyway), _
does not involve forbidden actions, because he who knows prakrti,
with its modes as different from the self, can have no desire
to gain the unreal. When he has no desire, forbidden actions
"
1545,"1490 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 13 .
cannot be performed by him, because desire is the only cause
of forbidden actions (Gita 3/37). a :

The Lord, exhorts a striver, to know the self in reality and
that there is no action, in the self. So he can be neither an agent,
nor an experiencer. When he realizes, that he is not an agent
(doer), his pride of doership comes to an end, and so he has no
desire for fruit of action, which are naturally performed by him
according to the ordinance of the scriptures. Having transcended
the gunas, (modes of nature), he is not born again.

Appendix—The expression ‘dehe’smin purusah parah’ used oo
in the preceding verse is explained in this verse. He whose -
discrimination has been aroused viz., ‘dehe’smin purusah parah’ :
has been realized, he, in spite of performing his duty according to
his order—stage of life (varnasrama), remains untainted. In fact _
a man (the Self) is untainted, but being attached to the modes, he
gets tainted and follows the cycle of birth and death (13/21). The
modes are related with Prakrti, not with Purusa (13/19-20).

The term ‘api’ used in the expression ‘sarvatha vartamano’ pt’
means that he, in spite of acting in everyway, like the person -
who is attached to the world, remains unaffected (Gita 3/25).

‘Na sa bhiyo’bhijayate’—As butter once churned out of
the curd does not become curd by mixing it with whey again,

Prakrti, a man is not bound by modes again. He merges into
Brahma viz., as Brahma is free from birth and death, so does
he become free from the cycle of birth and death. |

In the thirty-first verse of the sixth chapter the expression
used is ‘sarvatha vartamano’ pi sa yogi mayi vartate’, while here
the expression is ‘sarvatha vartamano’pi na sa bhuyo’bhyayate’.

In the expression ‘sa yogi mayi vartate’, the words used in the
sixth chapter, are in the context of attainment of love, while
in the expression ‘na sa bhiiyo’bhijayate’ the words used here,
are in the context of Self-realization. In both states of love and
"
1546,"Verse 24] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1491 .
Self-realization, there is no attachment to modes. The difference |
in the two is that in Self-realization, there is emancipation from
birth and death but in love besides emancipation (salvation), the
devotee attains oneness with God. ;
Link:—In the preceding verse, the Lord explained that the
true knowledge of prakrti and Purusa, is the means of being free,
from rebirth. Now, curiosity arises, whether there is any other |
means also to be free from rebirth i.e., to attain salvation. So, .
the Lord mentions four means, in the next two verses.

Some perceive God in their own self by the self through
meditation; others by the discipline of knowledge, and still others
by the discipline of action. 24 .
Comment:—
'Dhyadnenatmani pagyanti kecidatmanamatmana'—Strivers, by
meditation on the Supreme Soul, Who is formless and attributeless,
as Well as, endowed with attributes and form etc., (as described in
the twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth verses of the fifth chapter,
from the tenth to the twenty-eighth verses of the sixth chapter and
from the eighth to the fourteenth verses of the eighth chapter), |
according to their faith and taste, realize, the self or God. .
As by knowledge of the distinction between, Prakrti and
Purusa, one's affinity with Prakrti is eliminated, so is this affinity,
discarded by meditation. No meditation is possible, when mind is
either in a deluded state, or in the volatile state. Meditation begins,
in the non-volatile state. When the mind is concentrated in the self,
that is the state of trance, in which there is no thought, of the world,
"
1547,"1492 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 13 :
_ body or any inclination etc. Then a Dhyanayogi, by perceiving
the self in the self, by the self gets self-satisfied (Gita 6/19-20).
""Anye sankhyena yogena'—'‘Several strivers realize, the self
by the self, through the Discipline of Knowledge, as has been
described (from the eleventh to the thirtieth verses of the second
chapter, from the thirty-third to the thirty-ninth verses of the
fourth chapter, in the eighth and ninth verses as well as from
the thirteenth to the twenty-sixth verses of the fifth chapter and
in the fourth and fifth verses etc., of the twelfth chapter).
Here, the Discipline of Knowledge, stands for discrimination.
A devotee, following the Discipline of Knowledge, discriminates -
between the real and the unreal. The real is eternal, all-pervading,
unchanging, immovable, unmanifest and unthinkable, while the |
unreal is transitory, kaleidoscopic, movable and it always, 7
undergoes modifications. Thus a devotee following this discipline,
by discriminating the real from the unreal, isolates himself from
prakrti and its evolutes and realizes, the self in the self, by the self. .
'‘Karmayogena capare'—Some strivers, attain the Supreme,
through the Discipline of Action, as has been mentioned (from .
the forty-seventh to the fifty-third verses of the second chapter,
from the seventh to the nineteenth verses of the third chapter, from
the sixteenth to the thirty-second verses of the fourth chapter, in
the sixth and seventh verses etc., of the fifth chapter). A devotee
following the Discipline of Action, performs all his duties as well
as religious sacrifice, charity, penance and pilgrimage etc., for the
welfare of others. By doing so, his affinity with things, objects
and persons etc., is renounced and he realizes the Supreme. |
A man, has assumed his identification with the body. In
order to do away with the assumption, he should assume his
identification with the Lord, as he identified himself with the
body. This identification with the Lord is not through senses
etc. In knowing, the oversoul through instruments, dependence
on matter subsists. Unless, affinity with Prakrti is renounced, he
cannot get himself established, in the Supreme Soul. Therefore,
"
1548,"Verse 25] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1493 :
Self-realization is beyond instruments.
Appendix—As in the preceding verse the Lord stated that
attaching importance to discrimination is a means for salvation,
similarly here in this verse He mentions others means such as :
meditation etc., to attain salvation. In the Gita, God-realization
has been mentioned—by meditation in the twenty-eighth verse
of the sixth chapter, by Jnanayoga (Sankhyayoga) in the fifteenth
verse of the second chapter and by Karmayoga (Discipline of
Action) in the seventy-first verse of the second chapter. All these
are independent means for God-realization. 7 .

As a poor man, receives money from rich people, by carrying out
their wishes, a devotee, receives divine knowledge, by obeying
great souls. But the difference is, that money is gained.when a
rich man offers it, and obedience to great souls naturally, leads
a man to realize God, Who 1s automatically attained, as payment
of the money, depends on a rich man and his will, but God-
realization does not depend, on anyone. _ ee
"
1549,". 1494 | SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 13

A man regards the body's death as his own by identifying
himself with his body. Those, who rely on the advice of saints
and great souls, and act according to it, their assumed affinity,
with the body is renounced. So, they go beyond death 1.e., they :
become free from the assumption, by which they regarded the
death of a body, as their own death.

Such strivers, who rely on the advice of great souls, are
divided into three categories:— | :

(1) Those, who do not desire worldly enjoyment, but have
only yearning for God-realization; and the great soul they depend .
on, is really exalted, they attain God-realization, quickly. -

(2) Those who have a desire for God-realization, but their
mundane desires have not perished, by obeying great souls, first 7
they will be free from worldly desires, and then will attain God. -

(3) Strivers who only aim at God-realization, even though, the
saints whom they obey, are not exalted souls, will realize God, .
by His grace, because He being omniscient, knows all beings.

| ‘Actually, great souls transcend virtues and vices. If a striver ;
finds fault with them, he will behold the reflection of his own
vices, because they have no vices, at all. So a striver, need not
watch their actions and behaviour. He should draw spiritual
inspiration from them. He should neither speak ill of them, nor
find fault with them, otherwise he cannot progress spiritually.

Appendix—The people who have no ability to understand the
scriptures and whose discriminative power is weak but have a
burning desire to go beyond death, such people also by obeying |
the liberated exalted souls, go beyond death.

In the Upanisad, there is an anecdote. Satyakama, the son of
Jabala went to sage Gautama so that Gautama might preach him
the gospel. The sage gave him four hundred lean and feeble cows
and ordered him to tend them. Satyakama enthusiastically said,

“{ shall return only when their number increases to a thousand.”
Having said this, he carried them to the forest and began to rear ee
"
1550,"Verse 26] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI - 1495 :
them there. After several years when their number was increased
to a thousand, then a bull said to him, “Our number has increased
to a thousand, therefore you should take us back to the preceptor |
(teacher).”” Having said this, the bull preached him the gospel of .
the first pada of Brahma. The next day Satyakama started for
the seminary with the cows. On the way Agni preached him the
gospel of Brahma’s second pada; Harhsa preached him the gospel
of Brahma’s third pada and Madgu (an aquatic bird) preached
him the gospel of the fourth pada of Brahma. Thus on the way
having gained knowledge of the Supreme, he came back to sage .
Gautama. When the teacher asked him, he narrated the whole -
anecdote and requested the teacher to preach him the gospel in
his own words. Then Sage Gautama preached him the gospel
(Chandogya. fourth chapter, fourth to ninth khanda) (portions). _
In this way only by obeying an enlightened liberated exalted
soul, Satyakama attained Self-realization.

Comment:—
""Yavatsanjayate kificitsattvam sthavarajangamam ksetraksetrajiia-
sarnyogattadviddhi bharatarsabha'—The unmoving creation, such
as trees, plants, creepers, grass and mountains etc., and moving
"
1551,"1496 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 13 :
beings, such as human beings, gods, beasts, birds, insects and
fishes etc., (living on the earth, in the water and the sky)—all
are born, of the union of Ksetra (field), and Ksetrajiia (knower
of the field). .

All the perishable objects, which appear and disappear,
are included in 'Ksetra', which the knower of this Ksetra, ever
remaining the same, is Ksetrajiia. Affinity of the Ksetrajiia (Spirit),
with Ksetra (body), in the form of T’ness and ""Mine'ness, is the
union of the spirit and the body. It is because of this assumed
union, that the spirit has to be born, as moving and unmoving
beings. This union has been called, ‘attachment to the modes :
of nature’, in the twenty-first verse. It means, that the eternal

' spirit by identifying itself with the kaleidoscopic prakrti and its
evolutes, body etc., assumes itself as perishable.

[The birth of moving, as well as, unmoving beings, has been
denoted by the term 'Safijayate’ (Is born) and the death will be
denoted by the term 'VinaSyatsu' (perishing), in the next verse.] .
- *Tadviddhi bharatarsabha'—Lord Krsna, exhorts Arjuna to
know the fact that the contact (identification) of the spirit with
the body, is responsible for its rebirth. So, if it does not assume
its identification, with the body, it will not be reborn.

Appendix—Here within the expression ‘yavatsanjayate’ all
the creatures born from the womb, born from an egg, sprouting
from the ground, born of perspiration, water creatures, sky
creatures (birds) and land creatures, men, gods, manes, ghosts,
evil spirits and devils etc., should be included. The same fact
has been pointed out in the sixth verse of the seventh chapter |
by the expression ‘etadyonini bhutani’.

In the topic of devotion, the Lord, having stated the two-
fold prakrti—‘para’ and ‘apara’ as His, declared, “All beings
have evolved from this twofold prakrti and I am the origin of
the entire creation and it dissolves in Me” (Gita 7/6). But here
in the topic of knowledge, the Lord declares that all beings are
born of the union of ‘Ksetra’ and ‘Ksetrajiia’. It means that in
"
1552,"Verse 27] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1497 :
the topic of devotion He draws a devotee’s attention towards
Him because a devotee has firm faith in Him. God is his means
as well as end. But in the topic of knowledge the Lord draws |
attention towards the ‘Ksetrajiia’ (Self) that identification of /
‘Ksetrajna’ with ‘Ksetra’ has led the man to the bondage of
birth and death. Here the question arises that there is attraction
and union between the objects of the same class, then how has
there been a union of “Ksetrajiia’ (the Self) with the inert (the
non-Self)? The answer is that as there can’t be union of day and
night, similarly there can’t be union of ‘Ksetrajiia’ and ‘Ksetra’. :
But being a fragment of God, ‘Ksetrajiia’ has this power that it :
can draw an object belonging to a different class and can assume
its affinity with that object. God has bestowed this freedom upon
this being. But he has misused this freedom viz., he instead of
assuming his affinity with God, has assumed his affinity with -
the world and has thus got entangled in the wheel of life and
death (Gita 13/21).

'Samam sarvesu bhitesu'—It means, that the Lord abides

and forms, endowed with Sattva, Raja and Tama, modes of nature.
The Lord, in the second verse of this chapter declared, ""Know
Me as the Knower of the field (Ksetrajiia) in all fields (Ksetras)"".
As the Lord identifying Himself with the spirit (Ksetrajiia), there .
said, that He is the spirit in all the bodies, here also points out |
that He abides, equally in all beings. |
'Tisthantam'—All beings undergo birth, life and dissolution;
they are born in the cosmic dawn and dissolve in the cosmic
night. They are born in various species. In other words, they |
are always circulating. They do not remain constant, even for a
moment. But the Lord remains constant, uniform and the same, :
in all these revolving beings. :
‘Paramesvaram'—God, is the Supreme Lord, of all beings who 7
regard themselves as the Lord of someone or the other. He is the -
supreme Lord, of the entire creation, sentient or insentient.
'Vinasyatsvavinasyantarh yah pagyati sa pasyati'—He truly
sees, who perceives the imperishable Supreme Lord, the same, -
without any modifications, in all perishable beings. It means,
that he who sees his own self, identified with a body does not -
see truly, while he who sees his self, identified with the Lord,
sees truly.
In the second verse of this chapter, the Lord declared, ""It is
the knowledge of Ksetra (prakrti or matter) and Ksetrajiia (Purusa
or Spirit), which I regard as true knowledge."" The same fact,
has been mentioned by the Lord here, when He declares, ""He
alone truly sees, who realises the Supreme Lord, as imperishable
and abiding equally, in all perishable beings."" It means, that |
in the union of Ksetra (Matter) and Ksetrajfia (Spirit), Ksetra
ever undergoes modifications, while Ksetrajfia always remains
the same. Similarly, all beings are born and then their bodies
perish, but the Supreme Lord, ever ‘remains the same, in all
conditions and circumstances.
In the preceding (twenty-sixth) verse, the Lord explained
that whatever being is born, know it as emanated, from the
"
1554,"Verse 27] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1499 -
union of Ksetra, and Ksetrajfia. Out of the two the Ksetra
ever undergoes modification, while there is no modification at
all in the Ksetrajiia. So a striver, should realize this fact, that
matter is constantly separating, from the self. In this verse, the
Lord explains, that a striver should realize his identity with the :
Supreme Lord, Who is imperishable and Who abides, equally
in all perishable beings. |
Appendix—As in the sky sometimes there is light of the |
sun, sometimes it is dark, sometimes there is a cloud of smoke,
sometimes the sky is overcast, sometimes there is lightning and
thundering, sometimes it rains, sometimes it hails and sometimes |
_ different kinds of sounds are produced, but the sky does not -
undergo any change; it remains the same—untainted, unaffected
and immutable. Similarly in the omnipresent Entity sometimes
there is new creation and final annihilation, sometimes there is _
creation and annihilation, sometimes there is birth and death,
sometimes there is famine, sometimes there is flood, sometimes
there is an earthquake, sometimes there is a terrifying war but .
there is no difference in that Entity. There may be a lot of
topsyturvydom but that Entity ever remains the same—untainted
and immutable. This immutability is natural while modifications
(attachment) are unnatural and assumed. A person may be bound
or liberated, he may be sinful.or virtuous, this immutable Entity |
prevails equally in both of them.
As the Ganges flows continuously but the bedrock, over which
it flows, ever remains fixed. Sometimes the water of the Ganges
is pure and clean, sometimes it is mixed with dust; sometimes
water is lessened while sometimes it is in flood, sometimes the |
water becomes warm, sometimes it is cool; sometimes the speedy .
flow of water causes sound, sometimes it becomes calm. But
the bedrock remains as if is, it does not undergo any change.
Similarly sometimes there are fish in water, sometimes creatures
such as snakes etc., come flowing, sometimes planks or beams
come swimming, sometimes flowers appear flowing, sometimes
rubbish, filth and dung etc., appear flowing, sometimes a dead
"
1555,"1500 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 13 -
body seems floating and sometimes a living person comes
swimming. They all appear and disappear but the foundation
stone remains the same fixed, unaffected and immutable. Similarly
space, time, objects, persons, actions, states, circumstances and
incidents etc., are continuously changing but the Self (divine -
Entity) ever remains immovable. All changes and destruction
occur in space and time etc., but not in the self.
“Yah paSyati sa pasyati’--This expression in the fifth verse
of the fifth chapter has been used about the means and here in
this verse it has been used for the end (perfection). The same fact |
will be pointed out ahead in the sixteenth verse of the eighteenth |
chapter by the negative inference that he who looks upon the -
pure Self as the doer, that man of perverse understanding, does
not see right—‘na sa pasyati durmatih’.

Comment:— :
‘Samam paSsyanhi sarvatra samavasthitamisvaram'—The person
who beholds the Lord, pervading the entire universe, the sentient
and the insentient, the moving and the unmoving beings i.e., he
realizes his identity with Him, does not kill the self, by the self
1.e., does not follow a cycle of birth and death.
On the other hand, a person, who by identifying himself
"
1556,"Verse 28] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1501 -
with a body regards its fitness, sickness, birth and death etc., as
his own, destroys the self by the self i.e., leads the self, to the

cycle of birth and death. It means, that identity of the self, with

the body, leads a person to a downfall and he has to follow, the

cycle of birth and death. -

In fact nobody can kill himself, as the self is indestructible.
Moreover, nobody wants to make himself non-existent. In fact, to
assume identity with the body, is to commit suicide; to degrade
himself and put himself into the cycle of birth and death.

‘Tato yati param gatim'—A person (self), who by identifying :
himself with the body, had to take birth in good and evil bodies, by
realizing his identity with the Supreme Lord, attains the Supreme
Goal, viz., the Supreme Lord, Who is ever attained.

,

The Lord, pervades everywhere, every time, every person,
thing, incident, circumstance or action, equally. If He is hard ;
to be attained, what is easy to be attained? We can attain Him,
wherever we desire. In fact, the seemingly existent world, does
not stay even, for a moment. In the world, there is nothing but -
change. It is a mass of change only. As, when an electric fan
moves speedily, it seems like a circle and its blades appear like
the circle and they go out of sight, similarly, the world seems to 7
exist and the Lord like the blade Who really exists is not seen. :
Actually it is only God who exists. | |

Did these bodies, which appear today, exist, a hundred
years ago? Will they exist after a hundred years? If the answer
is 'No', it means that they do not exist at present, also. The
reason is that, whatever does not exist at the beginning, and at
the end, has no existence in the middle also. But God, existed
even before creation, will exist after dissolution and also exists
now. Thus, the world is actually non-existent, while God exists
always. But the world seems to exist, by ignorance, because of
God, who is existent. |
"
1557,"1502 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter13  -
If delusion perishes, the. world will not appear to exist, only

the Lord will be seen—'The Supreme is all’ (Gita 7/19). As in

different ornaments made of gold, there is nothing else, besides

gold, in the entire universe there is nothing else, but the Lord.

The Lord, existed in the past, He exists now and He will exist —-

in future. The only aim of human life, is to realize Him.

If a person instead of realizing God, gets entangled in the
world, it is not human, it is beastly. This beastliness, is to be
renounced. So a striver, should behold the imperishable Lord,
in all the perishable beings. If he beholds the perishable and not
the imperishable, he commits suicide.

In the Mahabharata also, it is mentioned that he who in spite -
of being imperishable, holds the spirit as perishable, which of
the sins has not been committed, by such a suicidal thief?

He, who beholds the Lord, pervading the entire universe -
equally, does not commit suicide but realises the Supreme Goal.

But, he who, instead of beholding the Lord pervading the entire
universe, beholds the universe and the body only, commits suicide, -
and instead of attaining the Supreme Goal, follows, a cycle of
birth and death. So a man, should lift himself by himself, he .
should not degrade, himself (Gita 6/5). |

As a face, reflected in the looking glass, and an elephant,
seen in a dream are not real, this universe in spite of, having
no existence of its own, seems to exist. If a striver, has a belief
that the Lord exists, and the universe only seems to exist, he
will realize the fact, in the course of time. When a striver is at
Vrndavana, he has not to remember this fact or he has not to
fix it in his mind by constant repetition, but he has not the least
doubt, about it. Similarly, if a striver assumes the existence of .
the Lord firmly, even though he may not see Him now, he will
realize His existence, because the unreal has no existence and
the real cannot remain concealed, for a long time.

Appendix—In fact in the twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth
verses there is description of the Self (Soul) but because of the
"

use of words ‘Parameégvara’ (Supreme Lord) and ‘Iévara’ (Lord)

-Link:—In the twenty-sixth verse, the Lord talked about the

union of Ksetra (Matter) and Ksetrajna (Spirit). There are two

ways to be free from this union—realizing one's identity with

the Lord, and renouncing one’s assumed affinity with Prakrti .

(Body). The former, has been discussed in the preceding two |

verses. Now He explains the latter, in the next two verses. -

yah pasyati tathatmanamakartaram sa_pasyati
He who sees that all actions are performed only by nature (prakrti),

and that the self (atm4) is not the doer, he verily sees reality. 29 -

Comment:—
'Prakrtyaiva ca karmani kriyamanani sarvasah'—In fact,

the self or the Absolute, is equanimous, tranquil and devoid of

modifications, while His potency, prakrti, is full of activities. .

Though prakrti is also said to be devoid of activity, at the time

of dissolution, yet on reflection, it becomes clear that it starts

its activity in subtle form, towards the creation, at that time,

also. That subtle activity, is known as non-activity, because in |

that state, there is no activity of the creation of the universe.

From the beginning of the creation, to its middle, prakrti moves

towards creation, while after its middle, it starts moving towards

dissolution. If prakrti is said to be inactive, during dissolution

and final dissolution, how can there be beginning, middle and

end of dissolution, and final dissolution? It means, that activity

goes on in subtle form, even during dissolution: ‘During a state
"
1559,"1504 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 13 :
of creation, there is more activity, while during the state of
dissolution, there is less activity. |
The sun rises in the morning. Its light increases from morning —
to noon, and decreases, from noon to evening. From evening .
to midnight, it grows darker, while from midnight to morning,
darkness decreases. Actually the juncture of light and darkness is
noon, and midnight, nor morning and evening. Thus the process
of light and darkness, goes on continuously. Similarly, Prakrti
undergoes activity, during creation as well as dissolution, new
creation, as well as, final dissolution.* | an

When a man (Spirit) identifies himself, with active prakrti, :
the activities performed by the body seems to him, to be his
Own activities. : |

""Yah pasyati tathatmanamakartaram sa pasyati'—All the _
actions, such as eating, drinking, walking, moving, rising, sitting,
sleeping, waking, meditating and trance etc., which go on in the
gross, subtle and causal bodies, are performed by prakrti, not by -

the self, because the self is without action. He who intuits this

reality, realizes that he himself, is a non-doer.

Here, the activities are said to be performed by Prakrti, while
in Other verses, they are said to be performed by the modes

of Prakrti, or by senses. These statements, though apparently

different, are basically the same. Prakrti is the cause of gunas
and senses. Gunas are the evolutes of prakrti and senses are the
evolutes of gunas. So all actions performed by prakrti or gunas
(Modes of Prakrti) or senses are performed, by Prakrti.

Appendix—All actions are performed by Prakrti, not by 7
the Self. In the Gita the actions, performed by ‘Prakrti’, have
been described in several ways such as—actions performed by
the modes of nature and actions performed by senses etc., as
all actions are performed by the modes of nature—‘prakrteh

* The duration of the new creation is measured by the sun. But at the
time of final dissolution when even the sun 1s merged, time is measured by

acting on the modes—‘guna gunesu vartante’ (3/28); there is
no doer other than the modes—‘nanyam gunebhyah kartaram
yada drastanupasyati’ (14/19); Senses move among the Sense-
objects—‘indriyanindriyarthesu vartante’ (5/9) etc. It means
that all actions are performed by ‘Prakrti’ only. Therefore Prakrti |
is never inactive in the least, while in the Self there is never
any activity in the least. Therefore in the Gita, it is mentioned
that the Sankhyayog1, who knows the truth, believes that he does
nothing at all—‘naiva kificitkaromiti yukto manyeta tattvavit’

The bodies, names, shapes, forms, mental projections, qualities,
modifications, birth, sustenance and, death, of all beings of the /
three worlds, are born of prakrti. The bodies of all beings, :
evolve from prakrti, rest in prakrti and merge in it. He, who
realizes this fact, attains Brahma 1.e., he realizes the Self or the
Absolute. Actually, Brahma is already attained, it was only the
affinity with Prakrti, which was an obstacle to this attainment.
When he realizes, that all beings rest in Prakrti, and are born
of Prakrti, he realizes, the axiomatic self.

All the moving and unmoving bodies, born of the earth, -
rest on the earth, undergo changes and activities*, on the earth
and merge in the earth. It means, that they are nothing else, |
besides the earth. Similarly, all bodies of beings, are born of -
Prakrti, rest in it and merge in it. So, they are nothing else,
besides prakrti. In the same way, the self always rests, in the
Supreme Soul. Though it undergoes modifications, because of -
its assumed affinity with prakrti; yet really, it is unattached. If
a person, realizes this fact, he attains, Brahma. -

Attachment and aversion, are born out of affinity with prakrtt.
A man, perceives virtues in others, if he has attachment for them,
but perceives vices, out of aversion. So, this veil of attachment
and aversion, conceals reality. But, when a striver, realizes that
his so-called, gross, subtle and causal bodies, as well as the bodies
of other beings, emanate from prakrti, rest in it, and merge in
it, then he realizes the negation of the three bodies in the self, |
the veil of attachment and aversion is removed, and he realizes
God, Who is ever realized.

Appendix—In the preceding verse there is mention of the

* There are two kinds of activities—those which happen (occur) and
those which are performed. The growth of a boy to youth and old age are the
activities which happen while eating and drinking etc., are the activities which
are performed. All these activities take place in bodies.

person while in the verse there is mention of time.
In the topic of devotion, the Lord declares that diverse

feelings of creatures emanate from Him alone—‘bhavanti bhava

bhiitanarhn matta eva prthagvidhah’ (10/5); but here in the topic .

of knowledge, He declares that diverse feelings of creatures are

centred in ‘Prakrti’. It means that where there is the distinction

between the real and the unreal, there all the feelings are centred

in the unreal but where there is the description of the entire form

of God, there all feelings emanate from Him. In the entire form,

the real and the unreal—’ All is God’——‘sadasaccaham’ (9/19). -

Comment:— |
‘Anaditvannirgunatvatparamatmayamavyayah'—As has been

mentioned in the nineteenth verse also, the self is without beginning.

But there prakrti has also been called, beginningless. So what is |

the difference between the two? In response to this question, the

Lord explains, that the self is without attributes (gunas), and their

evolutes, while prakrti, is full of three gunas and modifications. The

self, being free from gunas and modifications, is the imperishable

and untainted Supreme Soul.
'‘Sarirastho'pi kaunteya na karoti na lipyate'—The self, in spite
"
1563,"1508 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter139
of dwelling in a body, neither acts nor is tainted, it remains
detached, from prakrti and is attributeless and imperishable. It
is, neither a doer, nor an enjoyer. But, when It identifies Itself
with a body, It assumes, that It is a doer as well as, the enjoyer
of pleasure and pain. But, actually It is only an illuminator and
spectator, It is never tainted, because of being a portion of
the Lord. It ever rests in Him. The illuminator, here means,
illumination incarnate. It is not an illuminator, in relation to
the illumined. |
Here the term ‘Api’, signifies that every embodied being, from 2
an ant to Lord Brahma since eternity, has been unattached and
untainted, by its own intrinsic nature. He had never any identity -
with a body, as the two belong to two different classes. The body,
being an evolute of prakrti, remains seated in Matter, while the
self being a fragment of God remains, identical with the Lord. —
However he may seem to be mixed up, with the body and feel
identified with the body, his untaintedness, is never affected.
He, ever remains untainted. He may not realize this fact, yet he
undergoes no modifications. The self, did nothing, does nothing,
was neither contaminated, nor gets contaminated. °
Though the self, seated in prakrti, becomes a doer and an
enjoyer, yet in the twenty-first verse, the Lord announced, that
the spirit seated in prakrti, experiences pleasure and pain. While,
here He declares, that the self (Spirit) in spite of dwelling in
the body, is neither a doer nor an experiencer. Actually prakrti
and its evolute, body—both are one and the same. Actually,
the self has no connection, either with the individual body, or
the collective prakrti. But, it assumes itself, as a doer and an |
experiencer, by identifying itself with a body, otherwise it is
neither a doer, nor an enjoyer.
Appendix—The self is without beginning while the body has
a beginning. The self is without ‘gunas’ (attributes) while the
body is an evolute of ‘gunas’. The self is the Supreme Soul but
the body is the non-self. The self 1s imperishable while the body
"
1564,"Verse 31] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI | 1509 -
is perishable. Therefore though an ignorant person holds that the

self dwells in the body but in fact it does not rest in the body

viz., it is totally detached from the body—‘na karoti na lipyate’.

The reason is that the body is related with the world but the self

is related with the Supreme Soul (God). Therefore the self can °
never abide in the body. But without paying attention to this

fact, a man assumes the self to be abiding in the body.

‘Nirgunatvat’—Though the self is devoid of gunas, yet it
is bound by being attached to ‘gunas’ (Gita 13/21). Outwardly
it appears that bondage is natural and salvation will be |
attained by making efforts. But the fact is that salvation is natural |
and a person himself paves the way to bondage. Gunas are not ~
at all related with the self but they are related with ‘Prakrti’ |
(Gita 13/23). Therefore the self is without beginning, without :
attributes, is the Supreme Soul, is imperishable and it neither acts -
nor is tainted—all this is quite natural. A striver has to realize
this naturality of one’s own.

As while residing in a house, we are different from the :
house, so are we (the self) assuming to be dwelling in the body,
different from the body. .

‘Na karoti na lipyate’—The self neither acts nor is tainted—this
fact is not a result of any spiritual practice, but it is so by nature.

It means that in the self there is no doership-enjoyership—it is
self-evident. It needs no effort viz., nothing is to be done for ,
it. It means that doership and enjoyership are not to be wiped
out but they are not to be accepted in the self; but a striver has
to realize their absence because in fact they are not in the self.
Therefore a striver should realize that he is neither a doer nor an |
enjoyer. Realization of freedom from doership and enjoyership in
the self (disinterestedness and freedom from the sense of mine)
is liberation from the worldly bondage. In the Gita, this point
has been declared in this way that the memory is: gained—‘nasto
mohah smrtirlabdha’ (18/73).

If the self is not the doer and enjoyer, then who is the doer and
"
1565,"1510 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 13 :
enjoyer ? Let us reflect upon it. First think over—who is a doer?
The body is not the doer because it is perishing every moment.
Mind, intellect, citta (faculty of reflection) and ego—these four are
instruments which are called internal instruments (antahkarana). |
This ‘antahkarana’ is also not the doer because the instrument :
depends upon the. doer but the doer is independent—‘svatantrah
karta’ (Pani. chap. 1/4/54). An instrument is very helpful in the
accomplishment of an action (task)—‘sadhakatamam karanam’
(Pani. chap. 1/4/42). Therefore without the instrument an action
is not accomplished at all. As a pen does not write independently |
but that is merely an instrument for writing which depends upon
the writer (doer). Therefore an instrument is not a doer and a -
, doer is not an instrument. Secondly if there is doership in the
instrument, why does the self feel happy and sad? If the instrument
is happy and sad, what harm does it cause us? The true self is -
also not the doer because ‘I’ness is the evolute of ‘Prakrti’, then
: how is this ‘I’ness possible in the self which transcends ‘Prakrti’?
Had there been doership in the self, it would. have never been -
destroyed because the self is imperishable. Therefore here the
Lord negated doership in the self—‘na karoti’. |
In the eighteenth chapter also the Lord declares, “He who
assumes the self as the doer, that man of perverse understanding
does not see right because his mind is not pure” (Gita 18/16).
In fact he who is an enjoyer (experiencer) (who becomes happy |
and sad) is a doer.
Now let us reflect upon—who is an enjoyer? The enjoyer is
neither real nor unreal. The real can’t be an enjoyer because the
real lacks nothing—‘nabhavo vidyate satah’; while the enjoyership
comes to an end—‘na lipyate’. The unreal can also not be an
enjoyer because the unreal has no existence—‘nasato vidyate
bhavah’. In the unreal there is no consciousness. Therefore in
the unreal there can’t be even an imagination of enjoyership. It
means that doership and enjoyership are neither in the real nor
in the unreal. In the union of the real and the unreal also there
is neither doership nor enjoyership; because as the union of the
"
1566,"Verse 32] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1511 :

day and the night is impossible, so is the union of the real and |

the unreal impossible. Therefore doership and enjoyership are

merely assumed—‘kartahamiti manyate’ (3/27). When a striver_

discriminately, totally renounces attachment to the body viz., |

wipes out the sense of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ (which is actually not

there), then he remains neither a doer nor an enjoyer but only a

divine entity remains. In this way a striver, having realized the

absence of doership and enjoyership in him, is liberated viz., he

does not remain a doer or an enjoyer (experiencer) but remains

the Pure Self (Divine Entity). -
‘Na karoti na lipyate’-—-The Lord has explained and discussed -

this expression in the thirty-second and thirty-third verses of

this chapter. | |

[In the previous verse, the Lord explained by the expression |
'Na karoti’ (neither acts), that the self is a non-doer, while by
the expression ‘Na lipyate' (nor is tainted), He explained that
the self, is not an experiencer. But here in this verse, first He
explains, how the self, is a non-experiencer, while in the next
verse, He will explain how the self, is a non-doer. Why has He
changed the order? The answer is, that a man performs actions
in order to, receive its fruit. So, first he thinks of the reward, ee
"
1567,"1512 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 13
and then performs actions. Thus, the Lord asks a striver, not to
be an enjoyer. By renouncing the fruit of action, doership, is
automatically renounced.] __
""Yatha sarvagatam sauksmyadakaSam nopalipyate'—Ether -
equally, pervading the air, fire, water and earth 1s not tainted
by their qualities and modifications, because of its subtle
character. | : :
'Sarvatravasthito dehe tathatma nopalipyate'—As ether, equally
pervading the gross elements, such as air etc., is not tainted, .
so the Self pervading, all bodies is not tainted, because it is -
eternal, omnipresent, immovable, constant, everlasting, unmanifest, -
unthinkable and immutable (Gita 2/24-25) and the entire universe,
is pervaded, by the imperishable Self (Gita 2/17). : :
Appendix—Consciousness is one but because of ego, it -
appears diverse. The soul is called a fragment because it has
identified itself with ego, a fragment of ‘apara prakrti’ (lower |
nature )—‘mamaivarhso jivaloke jivabhiitah sanatanah’ (Gita 15/7).
If it does not identify itself with ego, there is only one
consciousness. Besides that ‘entity all is illusion. That divine |
entity is the base, support, illuminator and: refuge of all illusions.
That divine entity is not unipresent but that pervades everywhere.
The entire creation (actions and objects) are within that entity.
The creation is born and perishes but that entity remains: the
same. It means that the divine entity neither dwells in the body
nor in prakrti only but like the ether pervades everywhere within
and without the entire creation including all the bodies. That all
pervading entity is the self and that is Godhood. It means that -
the omnipresent entity is only one. That is Yoga of the Yogis,
that is wisdom of the wise and that is God of devotees. A striver
should always aim at attaining that entity.
That entity seems to be unipresent because of ego. That ego
is based on the desire for pleasure. While practising the spiritual
discipline also, a striver starts enjoying pleasures—‘sukhasangena
"
1568,"Verse 33] _SADHAKA-SANIIVANI a
badhnati’ (Gita 14/6). This desire for pleasure lingers till a striver ©
transcends the three gunas (modes). Therefore a striver should

be very cautious in order to ward off the desire for pleasure. —

Self is not tainted i.e., the Self is not an enjoyer. In the next

ksetram ksetri tatha krtsnam prakaSayati bharata

O scion of the Bharata (Arjuna), as the one sun, illumines the
entire universe, so does the Lord of the Ksetra (spirit) light up, _
the whole Ksetra (field). 33 4
Comment:— - ,

'Yatha prakasayatyekah krtsnarh lokamimarh ravih'—One sun, |
illumines the entire universe, and all activities are performed in
its light, but it has no feeling of doership. A learned Brahmana, :
studies the Vedas in the light of the sun, while a hunter shoots
animals in the same light, but the light is not held responsible,
for the study of the Vedas or for hunting. -

Here the term 'Loka’, stands for the entire universe (fourteen
worlds), because all objects (moon, stars, fire, jewels and herbs
etc.,) are, illumined by the sun.

'Ksetram ksetri tatha krtsnam prakaSsayati bharata'—Like the :
sun, one Ksetri (Ksetrajiia or spirit), illumines the entire field
(bodies) i.e., all actions are performed in the light of the spirit
(self), yet the self, neither performs actions nor, does it cause
them to be performed.

The sun, illumines the gross universe only i.e., actions of
the gross universe, are performed in the light of the sun, while
"
1569,"1514 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 13 -
the self (spirit), illumines the gross, subtle and causal, all the
three kinds of bodies, 1.e., in its light, all actions of the three
kinds of bodies, are performed.

As the sun, has no pride of doership of illumining the
entire universe, nor is it tainted by the evil of partiality, the :
self also remains untainted, unattached, impartial and uniform,
without having a pride of doership of infusing the light of life,

' and activity into the entire universe. It is the self, which is the |
base and illuminator, of all actions, things and appearances etc.,
because, nothing can exist without a base, and nothing can be |
illumined, without an illuminator. _

Appendix—As the sun ilumines the entire universe and in -
its light all the good and evil actions are performed but the sun
is neither the doer nor the enjoyer of those actions. Similarly the
self illumines all the bodies of the entire universe. viz., provides -

- existence and agility to them, but in fact it itself neither does any
action nor is tainted viz., it is neither a doer nor an enjoyer. It
means that the pure self takes no pride in illumining the bodies
of the entire universe.

Only one, who can do a work, is responsible to do it. As -
however expert a painter may be, he can’t make a painting
without the material (colour and brush etc.,) similarly the self
can do nothing without the help of ‘Prakrti’, therefore the self
cannot be responsible at all to do any action. This is everyone’s |
experience that we can do nothing without the body. Therefore
the body is of use only, if we want to do an action with it. If
we don’t want to do any work, then what is the use of the body?
It is of no use. If we don’t want to see any object, what is the .
utility of the eye for us? If we don’t want to hear, what is the
use of the ear to us? In the performance of physical actions,
the physical (gross) body is used. In reflection and meditation,
the subtle body is used. In trance, the causal body is used.* If
we do nothing with these three bodies, what is their use to us?

* Trance and relapse (deviation)—both occur in the causal body. When
"
1570,"Verse 34] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1515 ;
The body and the actions performed with the body are useful
for the world. The self is a divine entity, therefore the body and
the actions performed with the body are of no use for the self.
The self lacks nothing, it is self sufficient, therefore we need
nothing for ourselves. Besides the divine entity (self), there is :
none else because the reality can be only one, not two. Therefore
we need no companion. Thus when we have no affinity with
any action (doership), nor we have any relation with the thing
to be acquired through desire, nor have we any affinity with the |
possessions (sense of mine), the identification with ‘Prakrti’ will
be cut asunder. With the breach of identification with ‘Prakrti’,
the activity will take place but there will be no one as doer or -
an enjoyer (Gita 13/29). |
Link:—Now the Lord winds up the topic of Ksetra (Field, -
body), and Ksetrajna (knower, self), by mentioning the reward
of fully grasping the difference, between the two.

[The Discipline of Knowledge, begins with discrimination, |
and ends in real discrimination (knowledge). Discrimination,
enables a man to renounce his affinity, with prakrti and leads
him to God-realization. This fact, is mentioned here. ]
affinity is renounced with the causal body, that is the natural state of Self-
realization (Sahaja Samadhi or Sahajavastha). .
"
1571,"1516 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 13 .
'Ksetraksetrajiiayorevamantaram jianacaksus4'—Here, the
expression Jnanacaksusa’ (eye of wisdom), denotes discrimination
between the real, and the unreal, Ksetra and Ksetrajiia. The
Ksetra, (Field) ever undergoes modifications, but the Ksetrajiia .
(spirit) (the knower of the field), always remains the same and .
no modification, is ever. possible in it. |
| ""Bhutaprakrtimoksam ca ye viduryanti te param'—
Discrimination, enables a man to renounce his connection with
prakrti, and its evolutes. When a striver realizes, that he (self),
is different from prakrti, he attains God. |
This God-realization, has been explained by the Lord, by  -
_ different expressions (in the fourth verse of the twelfth chapter,
in the eighteenth and twenty-third verses as well as in this verse :
of the thirteenth chapter). _
In the Discipline of Knowledge, identification of the self with
the body, is the main obstacle to God-realization. So, in the first
and the second verses, the Lord discussed that the spirit (self) is
different from the body (Ksetra) (field). Then, He described in
several ways, that Ksetrajiia is different from Ksetra. Here, He .
is concluding the topic by declaring, that those who perceive the
difference between Ksetra and Ksetrajiia properly, their affinity,
with Ksetra, is totally renounced. |
: Ksetrajiia, has accepted its separateness from God, by having
a disinclination for Him, while it has assumed its identity with
Ksetra by having an inclination for it. So, the Lord declares,
both the facts—that it has its identity with God, while, it is |
totally distinct, from Ksetra. The Lord, in the second verse of
this chapter, declared its identity with God, while here He is
explaining that Ksetra has its identity, with the world. Both the
statements, mean that Ksetrajfia, has its identity, with God.
Into a pitch dark house, no one dares to go, after hearing that
it is inhabited by scorpions, snakes and thieves etc., and is also
haunted by ghosts and evil spirits. But, when a courageous person,
"
1572,"Verse 34] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1517 -
enters the house with a lamp, all kinds of fears are removed,
because he finds nothing of that sort in the house. Similarly,
by having disinclination for God, Who pervades everywhere,
in the form of light, the world, appears to exist to him, and he
is haunted by several kinds of fear. But when he realizes the :
reality, he comes to know, that the world has no existence, and
all his fears, are removed. Then he beholds only God, Who
pervades every person, thing and circumstance, all the time. A
lamp, has to be brought, in order to remove darkness, but this.

light (God), is not to be brought from, anywhere. Therefore, a -
striver, by renouncing totally his affinity, with the world, naturally
realizes the Supreme. -

Appendix—The knowledge of the distinction between ‘Ksetra’
and ‘Ksetrajiia’ is called ‘discrimination’. The strivers who having
attached importance to this discrimination, perceive the difference ~
between ‘Ksetra’ and ‘Ksetrajiia’ in right perspective, and realize
‘Prakrti’ and its evolute (body) totally different from the seif,
attain God. From their view-point nothing else remains besides
the Pure Consciousness.

The Lord by the expression ‘madbhavayopapadyate’ (13/18) |
mentioned the attamment of God endowed with attributes, while
here by the expression ‘ye viduryanti te param’ He mentions
the attainment of attributeless God (the Absolute). In fact the
attainment of ‘madbhava’ and ‘param’ is one and the same (Gita
8/21, 14/27).

Fourteenth Chapter
| | INTRODUCTION
At the end of the thirteenth chapter, Lord Krsna said that he,
who with an eye of wisdom, perceives the difference between
Ksetra and Ksetrajiia, attains the Supreme. Now a question arises |
as to what that wisdom (Jnana) is, what its value or glory is and :
how it is easily gained? The Lord, starts the fourteenth chapter, -
in order to answer these questions. |
Connection with prakrti and its evolutes, leads to bondage.
The Lord, in the thirteenth chapter, explained how to renounce -
connection with prakrti. Now, He starts the fourteenth chapter, in
order to explain the method of renouncing the link with its evolutes,
the Gunas. In the first two verses, He glorifies wisdom. |

the best of all wisdoms by knowing which, all sages have attained
the highest perfection, and were liberated, from this mundane
existence. 1
Comment:— |
‘Param bhiyah pravaksyami jfiananar jianamuttamam'—The
"
1575,"1520 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 14 .
expression 'Bhiyah pravaksyami’, denotes the Lord's declaration
to explain the knowledge (Jana) (discrimination) of Ksetra and
Ksetrajiia, prakrti (Matter) and Purusa (Spirit), as described in the
eighteenth, twenty-third and thirty-fourth verses of the thirteenth .
chapter. Oo | | :

This wisdom (Jina) is the supreme of all other knowledge—
spiritual as well as mundane, of arts, sciences, languages and

scripts etc., because other knowledge. leads to bondage, while
it leads to God-realization. Here, the Lord has used, two terms |
‘Uttama’ and ‘Para’, which mean the same ‘Supreme’ or ‘the |
best’. The term 'Uttama’ (best) denotes that this knowledge is -
the best, as it is conducive to renouncement of connection
between the body and the world, while the term ‘Para’ (Supreme)
denotes that this knowledge, tends to God-realization. _

‘Yajjiiatva munayah sarve param siddhimito gatah'—By
knowing, ie., realizing that supreme wisdom .all great sages
who attained God-realization, and being liberated, from mundane |
existence, without any exception. .

A muni (Sage), is he, who renounces his affinity, with :
the body. The expression, 'Pararh siddhim' denotes, that all the
mundane perfections including the Siddhis, such as, Anima,
Mahima and Garima etc., gained, by the Yogis are merely
imperfections, because all of these lead to bondage, and the
cycle of birth and death and are obstacles to God-realization.

The highest perfection, is God-realization because it frees a man
from the cycle of birth and death. |

Appendix—(This fourteenth chapter is an appendix to
the thirteenth chapter.) This wisdom of the division between
‘Ksetra’ and ‘Ksetrajiia’ is superior to all other earthly and
unearthly wisdoms and is the Supreme. This wisdom is an
unerring device for God-realization, therefore having realized
this wisdom, all strivers attain God viz., are liberated from
mundane existence. |
"
1576,"Verse 2] _ SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1521 :
_ ‘Jfiananarh jiianamuttamam’—This expression means that this
wisdom is superior to Sattvika, Rajasa and Tamasa knowledge
and also to the earthly as well as unearthly knowledge and is
the Supreme. No other wisdom besides this can lead a striver |
to the attainment of the highest perfection. There is nothing
else besides God—this realization is the attainment of the
highest perfection. It means that for the man who has attained
the highest perfection, actions and objects lose their existence
totally and nothing remains in his view except that divine entity
which really exists. : :

Comment:— | | —
‘Idam jiidnamupasritya'—In the preceding verse, the term
‘wisdom’ was qualified by the adjectives, supreme and best.
Having acquired that wisdom, a man's doubts perish, and he
becomes, an embodiment of wisdom. ; | -
‘Mama sidharmyamagatah'—Having acquired that wisdom,
people enter into the Lord's Being i.e., they become free from
doership and enjoyership, like the Lord and realize that they are
uniform and untainted, like Him. |
The wise, become uniform and untainted, like the Lord,
but they cannot create, sustain and destroy the universe, like
Him. Some of the Yogis by the practice of Yoga, acquire some
exceptional power, but that cannot be on a par with, the Lord's
power, which is but natural. The power of a Yogi, is limited,
"
1577,"1522 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 14 |
while that of the Lord is unlimited, as He is, omnipotent.
- 'Sarge'pi nopajayante'—Here, the term ‘api’ (also), denotes
that the wise are not born, even at the time of creation, when
different worlds come into existence, and their masters or officers -
are born. Those wise men, being free from contact with the
Gunas, are not born, because it is contact with the Gunas which
determines, one's birth. : . |
'Pralaye na vyathanti ca'—At the time of final dissolution, all
beings are scorched or drowned by floods. There is commotion -
and lamentation in the entire universe. But, those wise men -
are not tormented, they do not undergo any commotion or
lamentation. | | | :
They are neither born, at the time of new creation, nor are -
tormented at the time of final dissolution, because their contact
with Prakrti and its Gunas, which is the cause of birth, death
and lamentation etc., is totally, renounced. |
- Appendix—Till affinity with the causal body, persists
in mediation, a striver attains ‘nirvikalpa sthiti’ (a state of :
trance) and when this affinity goes away, then there is natural
transcendental awareness—‘nirvikalpa bodha’. There is relapse
from the ‘nirvikalpa sthiti’ but from ‘nirvikalpa bodha’ there is
no such relapse. It means that there is deviation in ‘nirvikalpa
sthiti’? but there is never any such deviation at all in ‘nirvikalpa
bodha’; this transcendental awareness ever remains the same.
This fact has been pointed out here by the expression ‘sarge’ pi
nopajayante pralaye na vyathanti ca’. : ""
There are new creation and final dissolution in ‘Prakrti’.
Having attained God, Who transcends ‘Prakrti’, there is no effect
of the new creation and final dissolution because that God-realized
soul has no affinity with ‘Prakrti’. That state, when there is
no affinity with ‘Prakrti’, is also called “atyantika pralaya’. It
means that when a man has affinity with the body, the evolute a
"
1578,"Verse 3] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1523 -
of ‘Prakrti’, he becomes dependent* and follows the cycle of

birth and death; but having totally renounced affinity with the

evolute of “Prakrti’, he becomes independent, unconcerned and

is freed from birth and death forever.

‘Mama sadharmyamagatah’—This expression means that
as God is Truth-Consciousness-Bliss solidified, so do the self-realized
exalted souls become Truth-Consciousness-Bliss solidified. |

My primordial matter (prakrti), known as the great Brahma,

| is the womb of all creatures; in which, I place the seed of all life.
The birth of all beings, follows from this combination of matter
and Spirit. 3 | |
Comment:—

""Mama yonirmahadbrahma'—Here, the primordial Matter
(Prakrti), has been called 'Mahad Brahma’, because of the
following factors:—

(1) The Lord 1s beyond the great and the small, therefore,

He is the subtlest, as well as the grossest. In the entire universe, |
besides the Lord the largest entity, is the primordial matter.
So, the primordial matter (mila Prakrti), has been called
""Mahad Brahma’.
(2) The primordial matter is called 'Mahad Brahma’, because
* ‘Karyate hyavasah karma sarvah prakrtijairgunaih’ (3/5)
“Avasam prakrtervasat’ (9/8) oe
Ratryagame’vasah partha prabhavatyaharagame’ (8/19).
"
1579,"1524 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 14 -
it is, in between 'Mahat' (Mahattattva i.e., cosmic intelligence),
and ‘Brahma’ (God). :

- (3) In the preceding verse, the terms ‘Sarga’ and ‘Pralaya’
respectively, may be misinterpreted, as Brahma's day and night. .
So, 'Mahad Brahma’ has been used, to denote new creation
(revelation of Brahma) and final dissolution (dissolution of
Brahma). It means, that a liberated soul's affinity, is renounced
with the primordial Matter. So it is, neither born, at the time of
new creation, nor are tormented at the time of, dissolution. |

The primordial matter, being the birth abode of all beings, is :
called a womb. Infinite universes, emanate from it, and again merge -
into it. It is the cause of all mundane powers, and energies.

This primordial matter is called 'mama' (my), because it
is the Lord's, it functions under His control, only. Without -
His will, it cannot do anything, through its own power. ""With
Me as the supervisor, prakrti brings forth, the whole creation""

(Gita 9/10). The Lord has used the expression ‘Mama mahadbrahma’ -
in order to explain, that He is superior to prakrti.

The spirit in spite of, being a fraction of the Lord, establishes .
its contact not only with prakrti, but also with its evolutes,
the three Gunas and their evolute, the body, having a
disinclination for the Lord thus gets bound. So, the Lord, wants to
emphasize the fact, that affinity of the spirit is, with God, |
Who is superior to His Prakrti, as the spirit, is His portion
(Gita 15/7). Therefore, the spirit should not degrade itself, by
assuming affinity with prakrti.

""Tasmingarbham dadhamyaham'—Here the term 'Garbham'
(seed), stands for totality of beings, with their actions and past
influences (latencies). The Lord, does not place any new seed.

The beings, who are following the cycle ,of birth and death,
since time immemorial, merge in Prakrti, at the time of final
dissolution (Gita 9/7). When their actions, having become mature,
are inclined to bear fruit, the Lord at the time of new creation,
"
1580,"Verse 4] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 1525 -
brings them into further contact with prakrti (this contact was
already there, with the causal body). This further gross contact
is what, He means by placing the seed. |
'‘Sambhavah sarvabhitanam tato bhavati bharata'—After the .
Lord, has placed the seed in prakrti, all beings with their gross |
and subtle bodies, are reborn. The birth of beings, at the time
of creation, is called the discharge of spirits (Visarga), which
also goes by the name of primeval action (Karma). So, it is
the primeval action, or primeval idea of the Lord, which brings
forth, the existence of beings (Gita 8/3). -
[So Jong as the spirit (Embodied Soul), is not emancipated, -
it continues to have its affinity with prakrti and its portion, the
causal body. So, at the time of final dissolution, the spirit with
the causal body, merges in prakrti.] _ -
Appendix—The Lord means to say that though the self
has got entangled in the cycle of birth and death, yet it is His
fragment. The soul is identical in attributes with Him, not with | -
the body. :

A poet, has nghtly said, that a turban, luck, speech, personal

two persons. In eighty-four lac species, so many beings since eternity
have taken birth, but their shapes are different from one another. _
'Tasam brahma mahadyoniraham bijapradah pita'—The
primordial Matter, is the Mother of all beings, that take birth
from different sources, as mentioned above, while God is the _
seed-giving father. The bodies, of different colours and shapes,
are constituted of matter, while the spirit dwelling in them, is a
portion of the Lord. The Lord Himself, declares, ""Know Myself to 7
be the Ksetrajfia (Spirit), in all the Ksetras (bodies)"" (Gita 13/2). __
This can be clarified, by giving an illustration of a piece of cloth, |
which is wet. In the piece of cloth there are many minute holes.
If it is soaked in, water it permeates, all the holes, equally. In
this illustration, the piece of cloth denotes matter (Prakrti), each
of the holes denotes a body and the water, which permeates the
holes and the cloth denotes God. It means, that God permeates
all bodies and the entire, universe. Though in different bodies
He seems different like water in holes. :

abstract, manifest-unmanifest—both kinds of bodies should be
included. The earth, water and fire are manifest. Air and ether are
unmanifest. The bodies of ghosts, demons and evil spirits etc., are
also unmanifest as in their bodies there is predominance of air. |

The Lord in the first and the second verses. declared that if -
a man (the Self) has no affinity with ‘Prakrti’, he is free from ~
birth and death and in the third and the fourth verses He declared :
that by having affinity with ‘Prakrti’, he has to follow the cycle

Sattva, rajas and tamas—these gunas (modes) born of prakrti,

bind the imperishable spirit to the body, O mighty-armed. 5 |

Comment:—

'‘Sattvarh rajastama iti gunah prakrtisambhavah’'—The three
gunas—sattva, rajas and tamas are born of prakrti (primordial
matter), which has been called 'Mahad Brahma’, in the third and
the fourth verses.

Here the term, ‘Iti’ (these) denotes, that these gunas (attributes a
"
1583,"1528 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 14

or qualities) out of which infinite universes evolve, andinnumerable _
beings, diverse in character, are born, are neither more-or less,
than three in number. i : a

'Nibadhnanti mahabaho dehe dehinamavyayam'—These -
three gunas, bind the imperishable spirit, to the body. The fact
is, that these gunas do not bind the spirit, but it is the spirit,

| which is bound by assuming its affinity with the gunas and their
evolutes—(objects, wealth, family and body etc.,). The spirit
identifies itself, with the body and is attached to other persons |
and wealth etc. So in spite of being imperishable, it regards |
diseases and death of the body, as its own and also the loss of 7
other persons and wealth etc., as its own.

It is a great wonder that the spirit in spite of being imperishable,
immovable and uniform, being overpowered by gunas and their -
propensities, itself becomes sattvika, rajasa and tamasa. Gosvami
Tulasidasaji also declares in ‘the Manasa’ that the spirit being a
portion of the Lord, is imperishable, sentient, pure and naturally :
a mass of bliss (7/117/1). ,

Actually, the spirit is never. bound by gunas but when it
assumes its affinity of ‘I'ness, 'Mineness' and ‘for me’, with the
body, it gets bound and the Lord seems to be attained with
difficulty by it (Gita 12/5). Due to body consciousness, bound
by the three Gunas, it cannot realize its immortality, which is

beyond the three Gunas. The embodied soul, in spite of, being
bound by three gunas in fact remains as it is. It means, that it
does not decay. So it is called 'Avyayam’. ,

With the sense of 'T' and ‘mine’, in the body, these three
gunas, bind the soul in the body. In the absence of a sense of
T' and ‘mine’ it is only God Himself.

The spirit, assumes its affinity with the body, in two ways.

(i) I am the body—sense of egoism.
"
1584,"Verse 5] _SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1529 :
(ii) The body is mine—sense of mineness. -
Thus, the spirit, by having links of egoism and a sense of
mine, is bound by, the three gunas.
Though a married person is linked with all members of the -
family of his wife, yet he regards necessities of his wife as his
own, so the spirit having assumed its affinity with the body,
regards the latter's necessities as its own. Moreover, in spite
of being imperishable, it is afraid of death and has a desire to
live. If it renounces its affinity with the body, it will have no
desire to live, nor will it be afraid of death. Therefore, so long 7
as, it has a desire to live, and is afraid of death, it means, that -
it is bound by gunas.
| The spirit is uniform and imperishable, while the body |
being kaleidoscopic and perishable, is decaying every moment. -
So, if a striver, does not attach importance to what is decaying
and perishing every moment, he will realize automatically the |
imperishable and transcendental self. | ;
Appendix—Being born of Prakrti, Sattva, Raja and Tama—
these three gunas (modes) are in the ‘Prakrti’ division. But a man
(the self) assumes his relationship (of ‘I’ and ‘mine’) with the
body, so these gunas bind the imperishable self to the perishable
inert body viz., ‘I am the body and the body is mine’—this
identification is caused. It means that all modifications emanate
by having affinity with prakrti. In the self there is no modification
at all—‘asango hyayarh purusah’ (Brhadaranyaka. 4/3/15),
‘dehe’sminpurusah parah’ (Gita 13/22). It is because of these |
modifications that he has to be born and to die. |
In fact the gunas don’t bind the individual self but this self
by being attached to gunas is bound (Gita 13/21). If the gunas
bound the self, then a person could never be liberated from those
gunas, till they persisted, viz., he could not attain salvation.

Comment:—
'Tatra sattvarn nirmalatvat'—In the preceding verse, the Lord _
described the three gunas. Out of these three, Sattva is stainless
and so it is conducive to, the knowledge of God-realization.
'Prakagakam'—Sattva being stainless and pure is illuminating,
and free from morbidity, of any kind. As in light, all objects
are clearly visible, with the predominance of Sattvaguna, all -
the propensities of Rajoguna and Tamoguna, are clearly seen.
Desire, anger, greed, pride and envy etc., which evolve from
Rajoguna and Tamoguna, are clearly seen in that light. With
the predominance of Sattva, the senses become animated and
the mind, works more promptly in understanding mundane, as
well as, the spiritual, topics. | |
The quality of Sattva (mode of goodness) can be divided
into two parts—{i) Pure Sattva (11) Impure Sattva. The former |
aims at God-realization, while the latter at mundane pleasures
and prosperity.*
With the predominance of the mode of pure Sattva, a striver,
* The impure Sattva is called so because it does not aim at God-realization.
This impure Sattva has 'Rajasa' in it.
"
1586,"Verse 6] -SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1531 .
having the aim of God-realization, has a natural inclination for
spiritual progress, while a person possessing the mode of impure
Sattva, hankers after worldly pleasures and prosperity, which lead
him to bondage. Even in the impure Sattva the intellect scans -
and grasps worldly objects properly and minutely. Having this
mode, scientists make inventions, but having no aim for God-
realization, because of their pride of success and desire for praise
and money etc., get bound.
‘Anamayam'—In fact, the quality of Sattva is not totally
flawless, but it is more flawless than either Rajoguna or |
Tamoguna. Only the Lord, or the self, is totally flawless, but -
Sattvaguna has been called flawless, because, it is conducive to |
God-realization.
'Sukhasangena badhnati jiianasangena canagha'—Due to -
predominance of Sattva, a striver experiences, joy and peace.
He is attached, to joy and peace, and he does not want to be
deprived of these. This attachment, leads him to bondage. :
During this period, his faculty of knowledge develops.
He comes to know, several wonderful facts and topics, never ”
known before. So he is attached to this knowledge, and he has
a desire to maintain it forever. This attachment is the cause of
his bondage. Moreover, his pride of superiority, that he knows
more than others, also leads him to bondage. Thus he cannot :
transcend, the three gunas. This attachment, is the quality of
Rajas, which binds a striver (Gita 13/21). If the striver, is not
attached to joy and knowledge, he transcends, the three gunas,
including the Sattvaguna and realizes, the self. ,
A striver, should not enjoy that pleasure and knowledge,
nor should he aim at them. He should think, that they are not
conducive to attainment of his goal. Moreover, he has to attain
that goal, which is an illuminator of pleasure and knowledge.
Knowledge and pleasure, are mental projections during the
preponderance of Sattva. These wax and wane, they come and
"
1587,"1532 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 14 .
go, while the self remains uniform, and constant. It knows no

_ increase or decrease. Therefore, a striver should remain quite
unconcemed and indifferent, to these modifications. He should
not enjoy them. Thus he will not get entangled, in pleasure and
knowledge, the evolutes of Sattva. If he is not attached to them,
he realizes, God quickly. Even if he does not renounce this
attachment, by having an aim of God-realization, in course of
time, he develops a disinclination for pleasure and knowledge, |
and then he attains, God. |

Appendix—Here the Lord has declared that Sattvaguna is

- flawless—this is singularity of Sattvaguna. The reason is that -
Sattvaguna is very close to the transcendental position (state).
| Though Sattvaguna is flawless, but because of attachment it
becomes full of flaws—-‘sukhasangena badhnati jnanasangena -
canagha’; because attachment is the nature of Rajoguna—‘rajo
ragatmakarn viddhi” (Gita 14/7). Happiness and knowledge are
not obstructive to the transcendental position. But attachment to
them is obstructive. Attachment means to assume them one’s own.
In fact Sattvaguna is not one’s own, but it is of ‘Prakrti’. -
A man has the predominance of Rajoguna—‘rajasi pralayarm
, gatva karmasangisu jayate’ (14/15), ‘madhye tisthanti rajasah’
(14/18). Therefore so long as attachment persists, salvation is
not attained; the Real Self being totally detached, complete
detachment is essential for salvation.
_ The Lord has said Sattvaguna ‘anamaya’ (free from blemish
or flaw) and also the Supreme State as ‘anamaya’—‘padarm /
gacchantyanamayam’ (2/51). By this it should be understood .
that Sattvaguna is relatively flawless while the Supreme State
is absolute flawless.

Though all the three modes are born of ‘Prakrti’, yet Rajoguna
evolves from longing and attachment and Tamoguna is born of
ignorance (14/7-8), but Sattvaguna is born only of ‘Prakrti’. It
means that ‘Sattvaguna’ is born of “Prakrti’ but it does not evolve
"
1588,"Verse 7] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI | 1533 :
from any flaw. Therefore it has said to be ‘anamaya’. ,
Sattvika happiness and Sattvika knowledge are also not
the nature of the self but being born of ‘Prakrti’, are of others
(alien) viz., are dependent. Sattvika happiness is dependent, it :
is not one’s Own nature, it is not bliss of the self.
Difference between Sattvika knowledge and divine knowledge
(self-realization)—In Sattvika jnana “I am Jnani (wise)’—this
attachment persists but “Tattvajfiana’ is totally free from attachment
viz., on self-realization, wisdom persists, but ‘I am wise’—this |
(sense) does not remain. In Sattvika knowledge the onlooker :
remains and he is conscious of his speciality but in “Tattvaynana’ -
there is no spectator, the self-realized soul becomes perfect but he
is not conscious of his speciality because he loses his individuality.
This consciousness of speciality is attachment. When he accepts _
‘I am wise’, then he is conscious of his speciality. On self-
realization, the self-realized soul realizes the bliss in the self. In
the twenty-seventh verse of the thirteenth chapter, there is the
description of ‘Sattvika jnana’ and in the twenty-eighth verse of

'Rajo ragaétmakamm viddhi'—This quality of rajas, manifests
"
1589,"1534 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter14._-
itself in the form.of passion or attachment to persons, things
and actions etc.
The Lord by the term 'Ragatmakam' means to say that as
| in Ornaments made of gold, there is nothing else besides gold, __-
in Rajoguna there is. nothing besides, attachment.

In the philosophy of sage Patafjali ""Rajoguna’ has been
manifested as 'activity' (action). But in the Gita, the Lord (in spite
of accepting activity, as the secondary characteristic of Rajoguna),
declares attachment, as the main characteristic, of Rajoguna.* .
Therefore, the Lord exhorts Arjuna to perform actions, renouncing :
attachment (2/48). Performance of actions without attachment, -
leads a man to attain the Supreme (3/19). In the twenty-second
verse of this chapter, the Lord while giving the marks of him, |
who has risen above the three gunas, declares that he neither -
hates activity when present, nor longs for it when, absent. It
means, that such a soul performs actions, without attachment.
Thus, it is attachment only, which leads to bondage.

At the time of new creation, the Lord's resolve of becoming |
manifold from one, is translated into practice. In the Gita, it is .
called karma (action) (8/3). When curd is churned, butter and
butter-milk, are separated. Similarly, at the time of creation, with
the rajoguni resolve, there is commotion in prakrti (matter) and

*This is the singularity of the Gita that without refuting a sect or an
opinion, it expresses its view. In the Gita on the one hand undertaking of an
action is Rajoguna (14/12) while the action performed without attachment etc.,
is said to be Sattvika (18/23). It means that actions do not lead to bondage, but |
it is attachment to them and the desire for their fruit which lead to bondage. A
man free from attachment is not bound by actions (4/19). They do not lead the :
liberated souls to bondage (14/22). The Lord also performs actions at the time
of the creation of the universe and also when He incarnates. But the actions
do not bind Him because He remains unattached to them (9/9). :

In the twenty-third, twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth verses of the eighteenth
chapter the Lord has described three kinds. of actions—Sattvika, Rajasika and
Tamasika. Had all the actions been included in Rajoguna, they might have not
been called Sattvika and Tamasika. It means that only attachment is Rajoguna.
"
1590,"Verse 7] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1535 -
then Sattvaguna, in the form of butter, and Tamoguna, in the

form of butter-milk, are separated. By the Sattvaguna inner sense

(mind), and senses; by Rajoguna, life-breath and organs of action;

and by Tamoguna, gross objects and bodies etc., are created. —

Other things and objects, are created by the three gunas. Thus
the Lord creates, the entire universe Himself, being totally free |
from attachment (Gita 4/13). :

""Trsnasangasamudbhavam'—'Trsna’ is. thirst or desire for
hankering after things etc., not yet acquired of and maintaining these |
having acquired them. This desire, leads to attachment for those m
things and persons etc. This expression 'Trsndsahgasamudbhavam'’,
according to Sanskrit grammar has a double meaning—(1) It is -
the source of thirst (desire) and attachment. (2) It evolves from |
thirst and attachment. As a seed sprouts up into a tree, and a
tree produces, several seeds, similarly rajoguna enhances desire, ~
and attachment, while desire and attachment enhance rajoguna.

It means, that they nourish each other. Thus, both the meanings
are appropriate. :

*Tannibadhnati kaunteya karmasangena dehinam'—Rajoguna .
binds the spirit, through attachment to actions. With the
predominance of Rajoguna there is enhancement of desire and
attachment, which induce a man, to perform actions. When he
starts actions, he is more and more entangled in their thought,
as well as in thoughts of new actions. Thus a man, does not get
an opportunity, to attain salvation. He, because of desire and _
attachment for actions is bound and follows a cycle of birth
and death. So a striver, should perform actions without having
a desire for their fruit, according to the circumstances available,
but should not begin new actions, for prosperity and pleasure.

Here the term 'Dehinam' (spirit) denotes that Rajoguna binds
through attachment to actions that spirit alone which assumes its
affinity with the body. A man feels happiness in even performing
actions with a selfish motive.
"
1591,"1536 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter14 >
A man is also bound, when he has a desire to enjoy, the
fruit of actions. Thus a man is bound by attachment to actions,
and the fruit of actions. OO Oe
In order to be free, from this attachment a striver, should |
always think of the kaleidoscopic nature of persons, things,
incidents and circumstances etc. All of these are decaying and
dying every moment. Even kings and emperors with all their
luxuries, such as riches, palaces and attendants etc., have met, the
same fate. Man should think, that he is going to meet the same
fate. So, he should not waste his energy, intellect and time, by
having attachment for actions and their fruit. This attachment, :
will lead him to a cycle of birth and death, and he will be
_ deprived of the real attainment of human goal. Therefore, instead
of performing new actions for prosperity and pleasure, he should |
do his prescribed duty, according to available circumstances, -
without having any attachment for it. Such thoughts, influence
a striver, for detachment, from actions.
Appendix—Rajoguna binds a man (the Self) through
attachment to actions. Therefore even Sattvika actions, because |
of attachment, lead to bondage. If there is no attachment, the
actions don’t bind him (Gita 18/17). Therefore by Karmayoga a
striver attains salvation because in-Karmayoga there is attachment
neither to actions nor to their fruit (Gita 6/4). |

But, know Tamasa (mode of darkness or ignorance) born

O Bharata, through inattention, indolence and sleep. 8 _
Comment:— .
-'Tamastvajiianajarm viddhi mohanarh sarvadehinam'—Here
the term ‘tu’ (but), has been used to denote that Tamoguna is
far inferior to Sattvaguna and even, Rajoguna. __
It is born of ignorance or folly, and it deludes embodied
beings i.e., those, who regard the body, as their self. It enshrouds
discrimination and so they cannot discriminate, between the real
and the unreal; and the proper.and improper. It does not allow -
to enjoy even Rajasika pleasure and prosperity. Then there is
no question of the safety of Sattvika happiness.
The Lord means to say, that human beings are deluded -
of Tamoguna, but He has. used the expression ‘Sarvadehinam’'
(all embodied beings), to denote that human beings, who lack /
discrimination are like other deluded beings, such as birds and
beasts etc., that eat, drink, sleep and produce young-ones.
- ""‘Pramadalasyanidrabhistannibadhnati bharata'—This Tamoguna,
binds embodied beings through heedlessness, indolence and
sleep.
'Pramada'—(Heedlessness), is of two kinds—(1) Heedlessness
by which one does not discharge one's duty which is conducive
to one's own welfare, as well as, to the welfare of others. (2)
Heedlessness, by which one performs futile actions, which are
of no use either to him or to others. Futile actions, can further |
be divided into two categories. |
(1) Extravagance, on smoking, drinking and movies etc.
(ii) Playing cards and backgammon etc., shooting birds and
beasts etc., and destroying plants etc. |
Indolence, is also of two kinds—(1) In this state of indolence a :
man remains idle, sleeps more than is required and ever postpones
"
1593,"1538 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 14
his work. This indolence, leads a man to bondage. (2) In the
second kind of indolence, a person feels drowsy after the day's
hard, mental and physical work. That sort of sleep is inevitable.
This indolence is not a defect. :
Sleep can also be divided into two parts—(1) Sleep which is
necessary, for a healthy body and a healthy mind. It 1s regulated
and is helpful in the practice of Yoga (Gita 6/17). (2) Unnecessary
sleep—One sleeps too much. It is a stumbling block to the practice
of Yoga and so it 1s to be discarded (Gita 6/16). .
Thus Tamoguna (mode of ignorance), binds a man through :
heedlessness, indolence and sleep 1.e., which are stumbling blocks,
to his mundane and spiritual progress.
,
Sattva (mode of goodness), Rajas (mode of passion) and
Tamas (mode of ignorance) bind a man (spirit). Out of the three,
Sattva binds by attachment to happiness, and to knowledge, Rajas
binds by attachment to actions, but in Tamas there is no need
for any attachment, it automatically binds a man. :
If a striver, is not attached to happiness, and is not proud
of knowledge, his happiness and knowledge, will lead him to
a state, which transcends the three gunas. Similarly, actions and
their fruit without attachment, will lead to attainment of the
Supreme (Gita 3/19).
The three gunas (modes) are evolutes of prakrti (nature) and
_ he (the self), is free from nature and its modes. But, he is bound, .
because of his contact, with these modes. So, if he realizes this
fact, he could be free from them.

' The mode of goodness (Sattva) sways one towards happiness,
passion Rajas towards action, O Bharata, while ignorance, veiling
knowledge, leads one to, negligence and inattention (Tamas). 9
Comment:—

‘Sattvarn sukhe safijayati'—A striver, is attached to happiness |
and thus he is bound. Because of this attachment, he does not -
make any further spiritual progress, and transcend the three gunas. |

In the sixth verse of this chapter, the Lord declared that
the mode of goodness, binds by attachment to happiness and
knowledge. But here He refers to only attachment for happiness.

It means, that pride of knowledge, also provides happiness which
binds a striver. So, He describes, only happiness. :

""Rajah karmani bharata'—As a child, takes pleasure in moving
his arms and legs etc., so a man feels happy while performing :
actions. As he is attached to actions, this attachment overpowers
him. He pays attention to the Lord's words ""You are not entitled
to the fruit of action’ (Gita 2/47), but he does not pay attention
to the fact, that he should not be attached, to actions. He goes
through the Lord's declarations such as, ""Your right is to perform
your duty; let your attachment, not be to inaction"" and ""Action is
said to be the means of the sage who wishes to attain to Yoga"" |
(Gita 6/3). So he thinks, that he must perform actions. Thus, by
performing actions he is attached to them. So the Lord warns
him, that he should beware of attachment to actions, which binds
him. A striver, should discharge his duty promptly by performing
actions, but should not get attached to them (Gita 6/4).

'Jianamavrtya tu tamah pramade saiijayatyuta'—The mode
of ignorance covers a man's discrimination and he cannot
"
1595,"1540 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter14
distinguish, between the real and the unreal, right and wrong.
So he is engaged, in idle pursuits, and does not discharge his
duty, promptly.
Two characteristics of the mode of goodness, are—knowledge _—__
(discrimination), and illumination (light). The mode of ignorance,
by covering discrimination, misleads a man to heedlessness and
by covering light (purity of senses and mind), misleads him
to indolence and sleep. So he cannot know reality in spite of
reading and listening about it. |
Appendix—Sattvaguna does not bind a striver merely by .
happiness but it binds by attachment to happiness—‘sukhasangena ~
badhnati’ (Gita 14/6). Similarly Rajoguna binds through
attachment to action—‘tannibadhnati kaunteya karmasangena
dehinam’ (14/7). But Tamoguna by its nature binds a man, n_~—-
jt there is no need for attachment. Therefore in Tamoguna the
term ‘sanga’ (attachment) has not been used.
‘I am happy’—this is attachment to happiness; and ‘I am doer
of virtuous actions, my actions are very good’-——this is attachment
to actions. A man is bound only, when he gets attached viz., __
accepts his affinity with happiness or actions etc.

disquietude and craving for worldly pleasure and prosperity etc.,
and Tamoguna viz., heedlessness, indolence, unnecessary sleep :

heedlessness, indolence, excessive sleep and delusion etc., -
overpower, the traits of Sattvaguna and Rajoguna.

The order of describing should be that one of the modes,
prevails overpowering the other two modes, and it binds a man. |
Here (from the sixth to the tenth verse), the Lord has reversed the
order as the discussion relates as to how, it binds a man, how he °
is attached, and finally how, one of the modes prevails over the
other two. This order is justified. The Lord, in the second verse
of this chapter, explained that those who have renounced their
connection with prakrti, are not born at the time of creation, nor

| are they tormented at the time of dissolution. But those who are
linked with prakrti, get bound (14/5). Now a question arises, how
they bind a man? The Lord, from the sixth to the eighth verse
has explained how the three kinds of modes bind a man (spirit).
Then, the question arises as to what they do before binding, the
spirit. In response to this the Lord explains that they drive him
to, happiness, to actions and to heedlessness (14/9). Again, the
question arises how they drive him, so the Lord answers, that
one of them prevails over the other two, (14/10). Thus the order
kept by the God is justified.

'Sarvadvaresu dehe'sminprakaéa upajayate jnanam yada'— :

_ When the mode of goodness prevails, overpowering the modes

When the senses and the mind, are cleansed, one can |
distinguish between the real and the unreal, right and wrong, |
good and bad and what ought to be done and what ought, not
to. be done. | :

By using the term 'Dehe'smin’, (in this body), the Lord wants
to emphasize the importance of human birth. It is only in this :
birth, that one can develop the mode of goodness i.e.,.purity and
discrimination. The Lord, has used the expression 'Sarvadehinam’

(Gita 14/8), for all embodied beings, who are bound by the mode
"
1598,"Verse 11] _ SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 1543 -
of ignorance. It means, that the modes of ignorance and passion,
develop in other bodies also, but the mode of goodness can
develop, only in the human body. So, a man by overpowering
the modes of passion and ignorance, should transcend even the
mode of goodness, in order to attain the goal of human hie. “
The Lord, by His grace has given us power and freedom in this
human body, to prevail over these three modes. _
""Tada vidyadvivrddham sattvamityuta'—When a striver's
mind, is illumined and discrimination is aroused, he should know
that the mode. of goodness, has prevailed by overpowering, the ;
modes of passion and ignorance. So he should not feel proud /
of his achievement, regarding discrimination and illumination, -
. as his own. He should regard these, as marks, of the-mode of
goodness. a
_ The expression ‘Iti vidyat’ (thus may be known), denotes -
that only a man can know, that the modes, not the self, undergo
modifications. But a man, by assuming his identification with
the three modes of nature, assumes himself as Sattvika (good),
Rajasika (passionate) and Tamasika (ignorant). So, by attaching
importance to his discrimination, he should regard himself free,
from all flaws and modifications. |
These modes undergo modifications, but he is an onlooker
who observes all the modifications. If he himself, had undergone
changes, who could have observed, the modifications? |
With the predominance of the mode of goodness, the senses
and mind, become cleansed, discrimination is aroused, dispassion
takes the place of attachment, quietude displaces disquietude,
and generosity displaces greed. All actions, are performed as
a duty, without desire for their fruit (Gita 18/9). The person
possessing this mode, does not attach importance to worldly
pleasure and prosperity, but only makes both ends meet. With
the development of intellect and discrimination, all actions are
performed very carefully and promptly, and one can distinguish
"
1599,"1544 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 14 :
between right and wrong..So, when there is predominance of ,

the mode of goodness, a striver, should be particularly engaged

in adoration and meditation etc., because, even a little spiritual

practice at that time, is very useful. |

_ Appendix—There is a difference between ‘prakaga’ (light) and

‘jana’ (knowledge). ‘Prakasa’ means wakefulness in senses and

mind viz., when there is absence of the world of fancy (greed,

unrest, craving etc.,) born of Rajoguna; and also absence of

sleep, indolence and heedlessness born of Tamoguna, but there

is purity. ‘Jnana’ means discrimination between the real and the

unreal, the eternal and the transient, what ought to be done and .

what ought not to be done, what should be accepted and what -

should be rejected and so on. : ~

Greed, activity, inclination to act with interested motives, unrest |
and craving—these spring up, Oh best of the Bharatas, when there
is an increase in the mode of passion (Rajas). 12
Comment:—

""Lobhah'—Greed, is the lust for multiplying wealth and |
possessions. But, if wealth increases without illegal means :
through one's own profession or business, though one has no
craving, it is not greed. |

'Pravrttih'—The urge, to undertake various form of activities
is 'Pravrtti’. Activity free from attachment and aversion, is not
harmful, because even great souls, who have transcended the
"
1600,"Verse. 12] ; .SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1545 -
| three: modes of nature, are engaged in activity (Gita 14/22). But
it is harmful, if it is. performed with attachment and a. desire

for its fruit. . Oo | oo. |

'‘Arambhah karmanam'—These actions are undertaken, in order

to gain wealth, name, fame and praise etc. Performance of new :

actions, for worldly pleasure and prosperity, is the undertaking

of actions viz., 'Arambha’ while one's profession or an activity

according to circumstances or need of the hour, is a 'Pravrtti'.

- The goal of human life, is not worldly pleasure or prosperity

but God-realization. So, in the Disciplines of Devotion and -

Knowledge, emphasis has been laid on giving up all initiative, :

for Arambhah action with interested motive (12/16, 14/25). In
- the Discipline of Action, acts are performed without desires and

self-centred projections (Gita 4/19). Without actions, a striver,
following the Discipline of Action cannot attain equanimity, (Gita -

6/3). So a striver, should be engaged in action, according to the

circumstances available, without having any attachment. By doing |

so, his urge for action, comes to an end. Thus, undertaking of
actions, turns into activity. . |
'‘ASamah'—Unrest or dissatisfaction in the. mind, is called |
""Asama’'. Unfulfilled desires cause unrest. If desires are renounced;
there is no, restlessness. |
'‘Sprha'—Desire for bare necessities of life, is ‘Sprha. A. striver,

should renounce this desire, because nothing can be gained, merely
| by desire. It is not an evil to be aware of hunger, thirst and cold,

but desire for getting food, water and cover is an evil.

'Rajasyetani jayante vivrddhe bharatarsabha'—When, there .

is an increase in the mode of passion, a striver, should think .

that his life is running smoothly. Then desire for more, is mere

stupidity. By such thinking, he should do away with, this mode

and become, indifferent to it. — |

The three modes—of goodness, of passion and of ignorance
being subtle, are beyond the access of senses and mind. So, they
are not clearly perceived, they cari be perceived only by their
marks or symptoms. The Lord. has discussed their marks, in |
the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth verses, so that a striver may 7
_ develop, the mode of goodness by prevailing over, the modes .
of passion and ignorance. | |
A striver, observes that the three modes of goodness, of
passion and of ignorance are born, they perish and they undergo |
modifications, while he himself remains the same. The marks of
the three modes, are perceived while he himself is an onlooker, :
so he is different from them. But, by assuming his identification
with them, he acquires flaws, such as lust and anger etc. It is an
invitation, to these flaws. While he becomes angry, he justifies
his anger, by thinking that everybody, gets angry. At other times,
; he regards himself as a man with anger, even when he is not
angry. Thus, this anger gets rooted in his ego, and it becomes
difficult for him to get rid of it. Actually, these flaws do not
abide in him, because he is permanent and flawless, while these 7
flaws stay in the mind and intellect, temporarily as these appear
and disappear. So a striver, without identifying himself with the
mind and intellect, should have a firm faith, that there are no
flaws in him. By doing so, the flaws, such as anger etc., totally
perish gradually. :

- The Lord, while discussing the marks of the three modes of
nature, wars a striver, to be aware of the fact, that the modes and

‘he himself being a fraction of the Lord is imperishable and does
not undergo any change. By thinking so, the mode of goodness :
naturally develops, and overpowers, the modes of ignorance and
passion. Attachment for happiness , relating the mode of goodness, |
is also a stumbling block to the attainment of a transcendental |
state. So a striver, should not be attached to happiness born of
the mode of goodness, because such attachment, is a mark of .
the mode of passion. From attachment, arises desire, and from .
desire (unfulfilled) ensues, anger. Delusion, arises from anger. -
This delusion, misleads a person from the mode of passion, to
the mode of ignorance, and he has a fall (Gita 2/62-63). ~

Rajas or Tamas. Sattvaguna, in its nature is immaculate. He who
dies during the predominance of Sattva (goodness), he attains to
the pure worlds of those, who perform noble deeds: ” mo
The term 'Uttamavidam’', denotes the knower of the highest
(great sages), having lofty feelings, possessing true knowledge
and performing pious, actions. A person, who dies in the mode
of goodness, which may be a temporary phase of his life, is
elevated, to the worlds, where great sages and saints live. It means,
that good traits born of the modes of nature, are as good as, are
pious actions. From this view-point, there is greater importance
of feelings (modes), in actions, than inactions themselves, which |
are sanctioned by scriptures. Therefore, the mode of goodness, -
occupies a very high place. Out of the objects, actions, modes
“ and aim, actions are superior to objects, modes are superior to |
actions, and aim is superior, to the modes. _
The mode of goodness, is more subtle and widespread, than
the modes of passion and ignorance. In the world, also the diet
of subtle beings, is less than of gross ones, as the gods being |
subtle, are satisfied only with fragrance. But, as far as, power
is concerned, the power of the subtle, is more than, the gross. -
So persons having predominance of the subtle mode (feelings)
of goodness, attain to the higher world.
Now a doubt arises as to how a person, who dies during the :
predominance of the Sattva (goodness), which may be a temporary
; phase of his life, attains to the higher worlds, attained by those,
who perform virtuous actions, throughout their life. The answer
is, that there is a special concession from the Lord that at the
time of death, by thinking of whatever object that, one leaves
the body, that and that alone, he attains (Gita 8/6). So a person,
dying during the predominance of the mode of goodness, attains
to the higher pure worlds, there is no doubt, about it.
Appendix—‘Tadottamavidam lokanamalan’—The people
who possess discrimination, are discerning persons. If they by
"
1605,"1550 S$RIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 14
regarding the Sattvaguna as their own, don’t take delight in it,

and have an inclination to God, then they by being detached
from (transcending) Sattvaguna, will attain the Supreme Abode

of God, otherwise having affinity with Sattvaguna, they will

attain to the higher worlds, upto the Abode of Brahmi. -

‘Amalan’—In the higher worlds upto the Abode of Brahma,
there is relative purity but in the Supreme Abode of God, there .
is absolute purity. , |

'Rajasi pralayarh gatva karmasangisu jayate'—When a
person, dies during predominance of the mode of passion,
when propensities such as greed, activity, unrest and craving
etc., increase, he is born among those human beings, who are
attached to action. :

He, whose conduct has been good, throughout his life and ""
who has performed good actions, if he dies, when the mode of
passion, is predominant, is born as a human being with good
conduct and emotion and performs, good actions. If a person .
possessing no virtues, dies when there is predominance of the
mode of passion, with propensities such as greed etc., he is born
as a man, who is attached to objects, persons and actions etc. He,
who dies during the predominance of the mode of passion and
whose life has been full of evil propensities, such as greed and
"
1606,"Verse 15] _ SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1551 :
anger etc., is born, as a human being, possessing the demoniac
traits. It means, that even as human beings, they are born of
three kinds of traits according to those of the previous life. But,
all of them possess discrimination, bestowed upon them, by the
Lord. By attaching importance to this discrimination, every human ”
being through spiritual practice, good company and study of the

| scriptures etc., can realize God, because they are eligible for
God-realization.

‘Tatha pralinastamasi miidhayonisu jayate'—The person, who
dies during the predominance of the mode of ignorance, when -
there is an increase in propensities, such as negligence, delusion .
and unillumination etc., is born, in the wombs of the deluded

7 (senseless) creatures, such as beasts, birds, moths, insects, trees
and creepers etc. Out of those deluded ones, trees and creepers /
etc., are more deluded, than birds and beasts etc.

If a person, performs good actions, but at the time of death
has a predominance of the mode of ignorance and is born in the :
womb of deluded one, then also, he maintains his virtues, good
conduct and nature. As the sage, named Bharata died during .
the predominance of the mode of ignorance, by thinking of the
deer, to whom he was much attached, so, he was born a deer.

But, because of renunciation and penance of his previous human |
births, he did not live with his mother and instead of eating
green leaves, he ate only dry leaves. He possessed so much
of carefulness, during his life as a deer, as is rarely possessed,
even by human beings. a ,

Appendix—-In Rajoguna attachment, rather than action, ;
binds a man and leads him to birth and death. It is because of
attachment that it has been said that he is born among those
attached to action—‘karmasangisu jayate’. In the form of action,
Rajoguna remains even in the person who has transcended the
gunas—‘prakagarh ca pravrttirh ca’ (Gita 14/22). If a person is
attached to any object, action or person, he will be born among

_ The fruit of good actions is said to be Sattvika (goodness) and -

pure, the fruit of Rajas is pain, while the fruit of Tamas (guna)

is ignorance. 16 | | -

Comment:— _ | | OO |
[Actually, actions are neither Sattvika, nor Rajasa nor

Tamasa. Actions performed by Sattvika, Rajasa and Tamasa a

doers, are called Sattvika, Rajasa and Tamasa respectively. } |
""Karmanah sukrtasyahuh sattvikarh nirmalarn phalam'—Sattva-

guna (the mode of goodness) is pure and flawless. Action performed

by the Sattvika doer (agent), is also Sattvika, because the doer

is reflected in his activity; and the fruit of that action, 1s also

pure and pleasant. . , *
So long as, a doer has his connection with the Sattvaguna |

(the mode of goodness), even though he has no. desire for fruit

of action, he is said to be a Sattvika doer, and his actions, bear

fruit. But when his connection with the mode is renounced, he

is no more called a Sattvika doer, and his actions bear no fruit, -

they turn into inaction. , : .

_ *Rajasastu phalarh duhkham'—Rajoguna, ts full of attachment.

Actions performed by a Rajasika doer, are Rajasika and so, 1s

their fruit. It means, that.Rajasika actions, are performed with the
| view of. getting; pleasures, comforts, luxuries, respect and praise
_ -etc., here and hereafter. But these pleasures born of contacts (with
objects), are verily sources of pain (sorrow), (Gita 5/22). These :
lead to the cycle of birth and death. So the Lord, has declared -
the fruit of Rajasa action is pain. | |
Rajoguna (the mode of passion), gives birth to sin and pain.
A person, possessing the mode of passion, performs sinful actions,
which bear painful fruit. In. the thirty-sixth verse of the third |
chapter, Arjuna asked Lord Krsna, “By what, is.a man impelled
to commit sin, as if by force, even against his will?"" The Lord |
answered, ""It is craving (desire), born of the mode of passion, -
» which impels a man, to commit sin."" 7 |
‘Ajiianam tamasah phalam'—Tamoguna is full of delusion.
Actions by a Tamasika person, are performed without thinking of -
their fruit, in the form of violence and loss etc., out of delusion.
So such a person, is reborn after death, in the species of silly
creatures such as beasts, birds, moths, insects, trees and creepers etc.
This verse, can be summed up as follows. The Sattvika person -
in all the circumstances, is happy, the Rajasika one, is sad, while
the Tamasika, is ignorant, having no discrimination. ,
So long as, a person is attached to actions, and modes of
nature, he cannot be happy, because his actions, bear different
. kinds of fruit, in the form of modes and circumstances. But,
. when he renounces his attachment to actions and modes, he
cannot be sad and bound.
The thought, at the time of one's death, is the root of a
being's rebirth. The predominance of anyone of the modes, is the |
root of that thought. The predominance of a mode, depends upon
actions. It means, that a person performs actions, according to
the mode and those actions, strengthen the mode and he thinks
at the time of death, according to that mode of nature. Thus,
the thought at the last moment, mode of nature and actions all

'Sattvatsafijayate jfianam'—Sattva, awakens knowledge or |

only good actions, which bear Sattvika and pure fruit.
""Rajaso lobha eva ca'—Rajoguna gives birth to greed etc. |
Actions of a greedy person, bear painful fruit. |
Greed, is the lust for multiplying possessions. Greed can
manifest itself, in two forms—not to incur proper expenditure and

to accumulate. wealth etc., by foul means. If a person, does not
spend money according to the need of the moment, because of
greed, he loses his peace of mind. If he accumulates and hoards
money, by foul means, he incurs sins, which lead him to hell
and eighty-four lac forms of lives, which are full of suffering. ,
_  ‘Pramadamohau tamaso bhavato'jnanameva ca'—Heedlessness,
delusion and ignorance arise, from Tamasa. A Tamasika man,
thinks of wrong as right, and regards, all things contrary _
(Gita 18/32). © . . |
- In this verse, it is mentioned that ignorance arises from |
Tamasa, while in the eighth verse of the chapter Tamasa, has © -
been said to be born of ignorance. It means, that as a seed is
? born of a tree and a tree is born of the seed, ignorance, is born
of Tamasa and Tamasa is born of ignorance.
In the eighth verse, the Lord explained heedlessness,
indolence and sleep, as the three propensities of Tamasa, while
in the thirteenth verse as well as in this verse, there is mention
of heedlessness, and there is no mention of sleep. It indicates,
that necessary sleep is neither Tamasa nor forbidden, nor leads -
to bondage, but is a necessity for a Sattvika person, as well as a
transcendental person (who has transcended the three modes of
nature). It is only excessive sleep, which is Tamasa and which
binds a person, because it makes him lazy, idle and a lot of his
time, is wasted }
The soul (spirit), in. spite of being a fragment of the Lord,
assumes its affinity, with matter (nature) and its modes. Those |
modes, give birth, to the propensities in the mind. Those
_ propensities, force a person to perform the same sort of actions.
The fruit of those actions, causes a person to be born in good
and evil bodies. It means, that during life, those actions bear
fruit, in the form of favourable and unfavourable circumstances.
"
1611,"1556 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 14 :
While after death, they cause his birth in good and evil wombs. .
But in fact it is the propensities of modes, at the root of actions,
which conduce him to have his birth in good and evil bodies
(Gita 13/21). It means, that attachment to modes of nature is :
not weaker than actions. As actions bear good and bad fruit,
attachment to modes of nature also bears good, and bad fruit
(Gita 8/6). So in the context of fourteen verses from the fifth to *
the: eighteenth, the Lord, first in the fourteenth and the fifteenth
verses, explained the destiny which awaits a man who dies during |
the predominance of one of. the modes of nature; then in the
sixteenth verse He explained the fruit of the actions in the form -
of favourable and unfavourable circumstances and finally in the
eighteenth verse He explains the different destinies, awaiting
those who are established in the three gunas. Thus, different _
propensities arise, from these gunas (modes) and these force a
person, to perform the same sort of actions, as has been described
in this verse. In this topic, the chief characteristic of the modes, .
has been mentioned.
A person, whose aim is God-realization, not mundane pleasures
and prosperity, does not remain established in prakrti (matter). So, _
he is not controlled, by the modes of nature. Through spiritual
practice, when his egoism changes and he has a firm resolve to 7
attain his aim, he realizes the self, which transcends the three
modes. This is called wisdom (knowledge), of the self which has >
been delineated by the Lord, in the first and the second verses
of this chapter, and also in the description of the marks and the |
conduct of the person, who has transcended the three modes, in |
the five verses from the twenty-second to the twenty-sixth. Thus
the Lord in this chapter, has explained how a person can realize,
the self or Him, by transcending the three gunas.
Appendix—Knowledge (discrimination) emanates from
Sattvaguna (mode of goodness), and if a striver is not attached
to it, it gets enhanced and leads him even to salvation viz., it is
"
1612,"Verse 18] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1557 :

greed, heedlessness, delusion and ignorance, then he can escape

Comment:

‘Urdhvam gacchanti sattvastha'—Sattvastha (who are
established in the mode of goodness), are those who have the |
predominance of the mode of goodness, and who because of that
mode, observe self-control and fast, offer charity, and perform
virtuous actions, such as running of cowpens and water huts,
construction of roads, plantation of trees and supply of food free
of cost etc. Such people, after giving up these physical body,
go upwards to regions higher than the earth, viz., heaven etc.,
referred to in the fourteenth verse of the chapter, as the pure
worlds of those, who know the Highest. Those persons who go
to higher regions, have predominance of the fire element in their __
bodies acquired there.

""Madhye tisthanti rajasah'—'Rajasah' (who are established
"
1613,"1558 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 14

_ in the mode of passion), are those who have predominance of
passion. and attachment, and who are engaged in pleasure. and

_ prosperity, without going against the ordinance of scriptures.
Such persons, are reborn on the earth, as human beings, in whom |
there is predominance of the earth element. | Oe

| The term 'tisthanti' (dwell), denotes that they dwell in the
middle region 1.e., they are reborn as human beings on the earth,

: because of their attachment to things and persons etc., while their

conduct is in accordance with the ordinance of scriptures.

_ ‘Jaghanyagunavrttistha adho gacchanti tAamasah’'—Persons _
having predominance of the mode of ignorance, being overpowered. -
by heedlessness, indolence and sleep, waste their time and
money, on trifles and futile pursuits.. They do not discharge their
duties sincerely, they think ill of others and they perform evil -
actions, such as theft, robbery and fraud etc. Such persons, die
in the predominance of 'Tamoguna’; go downhill, and degrade
themselves. :

They go downwards in two ways—lower births and lower
regions. They are either reborn, in lower species such as beasts, |
birds, moths, insects, snakes, scorpions and evil spirits etc., or
they undergo terrible suffering and torture in the infernal regions,
known as Vaitarini, Asipatra, Lalabhaksa, Kumbhipaka, Raurava
and Maharaurava etc. Those who in spite of having modes of
goodness and passion, in their life, die during the predominance
of the mode of ignorance, take birth in the womb of deluded
(Gita 14/15) while, those who have the predominance of the mode
of ignorance throughout their life, after death, fall into a foul hell
(Gita 16/16). It means, that a person takes rebirth according to
thoughts at the last moment, but gets pleasures or pains in that
life, according to actions performed, in the previous birth. For
example, if a man has performed good actions in his life, but
if at the last moment he thinks of a dog, he will be reborn as a
dog, but he will get comforts and luxuries. On the other hand,
"
1614,"Verse 18] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI - 1559 :

if a person has performed evil actions, but if he thinks of a man

at the time of death, he will take rebirth as a man; but he will

be deprived even of the bare necessities of life, and will ever

suffer, from diseases. - = ~—— ye oe _
In order to develop the mode of goodness (Sattvikaguna)

a striver, should study the scripture, keep company of noble

persons, reside in holy places of pilgrimages, devote mornings

and evenings, the most suited time, to devotion and meditation,

and discharge his duty according of his caste, creed, stage of .

life and the ordinance of scriptures..He should meditate on God :

and chant the sattvika sacred formulas. In Srimadbhagavata, there -

are ten factors, which influence in acquiring the gunas (modes).

These are—scriptures, water (diet), subjects (company), place,

time, actions, birth, sacred formula, (mantra). and past. influences ~

(Samskara). They develop Sattvika, Rajasika and Tamasika gunas,

according to their own nature. . |
A person, having predominance of the mode of passion :

(Rajoguna), at the time of death, is reborn in the mortal world,

as a human being (14/15) and a person established in the mode of

passion, is also reborn as a human being (14/18). It means, that all

human beings have only the mode of passion, they have neither

the mode of goodness (Sattvaguna) nor the mode of ignorance

(Tamoguna). But actually it is not so, because the Lord Himself

declares, that when a man dies, during the predominance of 7

Sattva. (goodness), he attains to the pure worlds (14/14) and -

when he dies, being established in the mode of goodness, he

goes to higher regions (14/18). Similarly, He declares that if a

person dies, during the predominance of Tamas (ignorance), he

is born in the womb of the deluded (14/15) and if he dies when

he is established in the mode of ignorance, he sinks downwards

(14/18). The three modes (gunas) of goodness (Sattva), passion
"
1615,"1560 $RIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter14.
(Rajas) and ignorance (Tamas): bind, the imperishable spirit to

the body (14/5). The whole world, is deluded by the threefold
-modes, of nature (7/13). The doers are said to be, of three
types—Sattvika, Rajasika and Tamasika (18/26—28). There is =
no being, in the entire universe, which is free, from the three
modes born of nature (18/40). | |

Those who go to higher regions, have. predominance of the
mode of goodness, while the modes of passion and ignorance,
occupy a secondary place. Those who are born in the mortal |
world as human beings, have predominance of the mode of
passion, while the mode of goodness occupiés, a subsidiary place -
and the mode of ignorance, occupies a third place. Those, who _
sink downwards have predominance of the mode of ignorance,
while the modes of passion and goodness respectively, occupy -
the second and third place. Thus, when there is predominance
of one of the modes in a person, he also possesses the other
two modes, to a certain extent. Thus, with the predominance of
anyone of the modes, every being has a different nature.

As the Lord, in spite of performing the Sattvika, Rajasika
and Tamasika actions, remains, above these threefold modes of
nature (4/13), similarly, great men who transcend the modes of
nature, remain unaffected by the reactions of the Sattvika, Rajasika
and Tamasika, propensities (14/22). Therefore, adoration to the
Lord and company of the transcendental souls, are helpful, for
a Striver in transcending, the modes of nature. |

Appendix—If there is a little increase in Tamoguna, then a |
man is reborn in the womb of the stupid creatures and if there .
is much increase in Tamoguna, he is hurled into hells. - |

the modes and actions, because they ever undergo modifications,
while there is no modification, at all in the self. The thoughtful
striver, who attains knowledge of the self, attains to the Lord's

that assumption is wiped out and he realizes his natural identity

janmamrtyujaraduhkhairvimukto'mrtamasnute
When the embodied soul (wise) rises above these three gunas 7
(modes) out of which the body is evolved, he is freed from birth, _
death, old age and pain and he achieves immortality. 20
Comment:— | | | |
‘Gunanetanatitya trindehi dehasamudbhavan'—Though a -
thoughtful person (scul), has no connection with the body, yet
people think him dwelling in the body. So he has been termed
as ‘Dehi (Embodied Soul). .
A body is evolved out of these modes. A man (soul),
assumes his affinity with these modes. Attachment to these ,
modes, is the cause of his birth, in good and evil wombs (Gita
13/21). A thoughtful person rises above the three modes, which
have been discussed, from the fifth to the eighteenth verses of
: this chapter 1.e., he renounces his assumed affinity with them, ,
because he clearly perceives that he (self), is distinct from the
gunas, having no connection at all, because the self undergoes
no change while, the gunas always undergo modifications. The |
self, has no connection even with, prakrti (matter), from which ;
these modes evolve. Then how could he (self), have any. affinity
with gunas?
'‘Janmamrtyujaraduhkhairvimukto'mrtamasnute'—When a
striver, rises: above these three modes, he becomes free, from
the sufferings of birth, death and old age, because attachment to
these modes, is the cause of his birth etc. These modes, appear
"
1618,"Verse 20] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI : 1563 -
and disappear, and they also undergo modifications, in their :
forms—Sattvika, Rajasa and Tamasa, while he (the self), ever
remains detached and so undergoes no modifications in the form
of birth, death and old age. It is because of his attachment, to |
the gunas, that he suffers the pangs of birth, death-and old age. a
One, who realizes the self, totally detached from these modes,
attains immortality, which is natural. -

A man (soul), by his identification with a body; regards its
death as his death. He being a portion of the Lord, is immortal
but, being attached to pleasure and prosperity, and having a desire ,
to maintain the decaying and dying body, he does not realize his -
immortality. A thoughtful person, applying his discrimination,
comes to know that he is different from the body, and thus :
realizes, his immortality. : 7 :

Attainment of His Being, as described in the preceding verse
and attainment of immortality, described in this verse, are one
and the same. | / | | |

In verses 7/29, 13/8 and 14/20, there is mention only of

old age, there is no mention of childhood and youth. Why? The :
reason is, that a person does not suffer so much, in these two
stages, as he suffers in old age, because in old age he becomes
feeble and has not much physical power. ee

At the time of death, also he suffers a lot of afflictions. But,
he who rises above the three gunas, becomes free from the pain
of birth, death and old age forever. |

He, who realizes the true nature of the self, is not reborn. |
During his life he will pass through the stages of old age and |
death, but these will not give him pain. :

A man (the self), by his identification with a body is reborn, |

and assumes the body's old age and pain etc., in him. The body
is evolved, out of the three modes. A transcendental great person,
being free from the three modes, becomes free from all the :
"
1619,"1564 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 14 -
pains, which he bore, because of his assumed identification,
with the body. . | |

Therefore, every person should realize his transcendental
self, before death. When he transcends the three gunas (modes),
he is freed from all the sufferings, of old age and death, and he -
realizes his immortality, and is not reborn. |

| Appendix—Every human being has the feeling that he should

live alive and never die. He wants to be immortal. His desire for
immortality proves that in fact he is immortal. Had he (the self)
not been immortal, he would have not desired to be immortal. -
For example if a person feels hungry and thirsty, it proves that :
there are such things (food and water) by which his hunger and
thirst may be satisfied. If there had not been food and water, he .
would have not felt hungry and thirsty. Therefore immortality is
self-evident—‘bhutagramah sa evayarh’ (Gita 8/19). When a man ;
(the self) in spite of being immortal, ignoring his discrimination,
assumes his identification with the body viz., he assumes “I |
am the body”, then he is in dread of death and desires to be
immortal. But when he attaches importance to his discrimination ;
and accepts the fact “I am not the body because the body is
ever mortal while I am ever immortal,” then he realizes his
axiomatic immortality. The Self, ever being uniform, perceives __
the modifications and changes of the body. Therefore a striver
instead of attaching importance to modifications and changes,
should attach importance to the beingness of the Self (which is
ever existent) and to his immortality.

This verse is the gist of the fourteenth chapter. /

. prakaSam ca pravrttin ca mohameva ca pandava
na dvesti sampravrttani na _ nivrttani kanksati
| The Blessed Lord said: 7 _

O Pandava, he does not hate illumination, activity and delusion
when those are abundantly present, nor does he long for them,
when all absent. 22
Comment:— -

'Prakasarh ca'—Purity of the senses and mind, is called
‘Prakasa’, or illumination. It means, that illumination is the |
power, which enables the senses to perceive the five objects of -
senses, the mind, to think and the intellect, to judge. -

The Lord (in 14/11) explained two marks of the mode of Sattva |
(goodness)—illumination (purity) and knowledge. Out of the two, -
only illumination has been mentioned here because in the mode,
of goodness illumination occupies a predominant place. Unless
there is illumination (purity) in the senses, mind and intellect,
discrimination, is not aroused. Illumination arouses knowledge.

So knowledge should be included within, illumination. .

'Pravrttimn ca'—So long as, a person is attached to the modes
of nature, the propensities, such as greed, activity, undertaking
of actions, unrest and craving, of the mode of passion arise.

But when a man rises above, the three gunas (modes), the
propensities of the mode of passion, do not spring up, but there
is activity free from attachment and desire. Thus, the activity of
the transcendental person, is flawless.

The mode of passion, has two forms—attachment and actions. |
Out of the two, attachment is the root cause of all suffering. A
transcendental person, is free from attachment. But he performs

actions, without having any desire, for the fruit of actions. These
actions denote 'Pravrtti’ (Activity). — —

""Mohameva ca pandava'—Delusion, can be of two kinds
"
1622,"Verse 22] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI | | 1567
(i) absence of discrimination, between the real and the unreal

or between what ought to be done, and what ought not to be

done. (ii) Error, in practical life. As far as the first kind of

delusion, is concerned, a transcendental soul, is totally free from
it. But, as far as, an error in practical life is concerned, even a
transcendental person, may commit it. He may have an optical

illusion, and may take a rope for a snake and a shell, as a piece

of silver, by error.

""Na dvesti sampravrttani na nivrttani kanksati'—Illumination
is the effect of Sattva, activity of Rajas and delusion of Tamas. ;
A transcendental person, does not hate illumination, activity and -
delusion, when these are present, nor does he long for them,
when they are absent. It means, that he does not hate them by
thinking why they have evolved, and that they should disappear, -
nor does he desire, that they should continue or they should
evolve, again. A person, who has transcended the three modes
of nature, remains indifferent, to them. 7

One thing, arises as ‘cropping up of thoughts’ while another
is, ‘to be engaged in thoughts’ (have feelings of attachment and
aversion). There is a world of difference, between the two.

The former is cosmic, while the latter is personal. We are not
responsible for what happens in the world, but we are held
responsible, for what we do. Moreover, by having attachment

and aversion for worldly activities, we assume our affinity with 7
them 1.e., we become a doer and so we have to get the fruit. If we :
do not assume our affinity, with these, we cannot be responsible

for them, and we will not, have to reap their fruit (because they |

are performed by the body, a fragment of the world) in the same

way, as we are not held responsible for the numberless actions,

which are performed, in the world, through cosmic power. So

a striver, should have neither attachment nor aversion to good
"
1623,"1568 | SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 14
and evil propensities, evolved from the three modes of nature
i.e., he should not assume affinity with them. ne

These propensities, appear in the mind, of even transcendental
souls. They appear and again disappear. But, he has neither -
attachment nor aversion for them, he does not even perceive
them, as such because he beholds, nothing else besides the Lord,
in the entire universe. , ; OS

One is to perceive, while the other is automatically seen.

‘To see’ comes within 'doing'.and ‘automatically seen’ comes, |
_ within ‘what happens.’ A fault lies in ‘seeing’, not in 'what is |
automatically seen.’ A striver, should not feel perturbed, even if ~
he perceives the worst propensity, in his mind. He should have,
neither attachment nor aversion to it. He commits an. error, that
he is either attached to those propensities, or has an aversion to — -
them, and so he is entangled. Lord Rama says to His younger
brother, Bharata in the Ramacaritamanasa:—

""O dear! There are innumerable virtues and vices evolved, by
the deluding potency of the Lord. Discrimination, consists in their
non-perception while ignorance consists in their perception” (7/41).

A striver, should think seriously, that dispositions appear and
disappear, but he (the self) remains the same. The changeable
cannot see the changeable, only the changeless can see, the
changeable. This is a rule. It proves, that the self is an observer,
while the dispositions, are to be observed. So, he is different
from them. So he should not assume his affinity with them, he
should, neither be pleased nor displeased with, the appearance |
and disappearance of the kaleidoscopic, mutable and perishable, |
dispositions. He should ever remain fixed, in his real self, which
is non-changing, immutable and imperishable.

Appendix—The man, who transcends gunas, desires neither
the favourable circumstances to continue nor the unfavourable
ones to disappear. Having realized his immutability, he has the
knowledge of the desirable and the undesirable circumstances, |
"
1624,"Verse 23]. SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1569 -
but he (the Self) is not affected by them. The propensities of
the mind change but he himself remains untainted. The striver
should not be affected by dispositions because the transcendental
soul is the ideal for a striver and the striver is his follower. /
- Jt is inevitable for every striver that he should not identify
the Self with the body. The dispositions are there in the mind, not
in the Self. Therefore a striver should regard these dispositions
neither as good nor bad nor in the Self. The reason is that these
propensities are fleeting but the Self ever remains the same. Had ;
these propensities been in us (the Self), they would have persisted, /
so long as the Self exists. But this is every one’s experience -
that we ever exist but the propensities appear and disappear.
These propensities are evolute of prakrti, while we (the Self) |
are identified with God. Therefore the Self, who experiences the .
modifications apart from the Self, remains uniform.

He who like one unconcerned, is not moved by the modes

wavering, knows, that it is only the modes, that act. 23.
Comment:—
""Udasinavadasinah'—When two persons fight, he who sides
with either is called, partial. He who is just, to both is a mediator,
while ‘Udasina' is he, who sees the two but has an attitude of
indifference, towards either of the two. From the view point of
a realized soul, who has risen above the three gunas, there is no
existence of the world, except God. He himself has merged in
God. So to whom should he be indifferent? Therefore, no question
"
1625,"1570 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter14™
of his being indifferent, arises. But to common people, he seems
indifferent to the world. That state is described as ‘'Udasinavat'.
‘Gunairyo na vicalyate'—-The propensities of modes of
goodness, passion, and ignorance, appear in his mind but he is ©
| not moved, by these. He is unconcerned, as he remains when
those propensities come to the minds of others, because he
perceives that nothing exists, besides the Lord.
‘Guna vartanta ityeva yo'vatisthati'—He remains, fixed in the
‘self, by understanding that it is the modes, which are acting, on |
the modes (Gita 3/28). os | a -
""Nengate'—A person, who rises above the three modes of -
nature, does not perform any action himself, because in the
imperishable pure self, there is no activity. |
(In the above-mentioned two verses, the Lord has described -
the attitude of indifference and untaintedness of the person, who
has transcended, the modes of nature.] |
Appendix—‘Na vicalyate’, ‘avatisthati’ and ‘nengate’—1in fact .
these three expressions have the same meaning. But the purpose
of giving these three expressions is that the transcendental exalted = -
soul remains fixed (established) in the Self. He neither wavers
himself nor can be moved by anyone else.
| ‘To do’, ‘to be or to occur’ and ‘is’—there are these three
states. If ‘to do’ is changed into ‘to be’ and ‘to be’ is changed
into ‘is’, then ego is totally wiped out. A worldly minded person
(not a striver) holds, “I am doing actions”—‘ahankaravimidhatma
kartahamiti manyate’ (Gita 3/27). He, who becomes a doer, has |
| to become an enjoyer also. The striver with the predominance of
discrimination, realizes that ‘actions are occurring’ —‘guna gunesu
vartanta’ (Gita 3/28) viz., ‘I do nothing’—‘naiva kificitkaromitt’
(Gita 5/8). But he who has realized the Self, such an enlightened
exalted soul realizes only an entity (‘is’)—‘yo’ vatisthati nengate’.
That divine entity equally pervades all actions. Actions come
to an end but the consciousness remains the same. An exalted

Comment:— |
'Dhirah samaduhkhasukhah'—A person, having transcended
the modes of nature, discriminates the real from the unreal, and
remains firm (fixed), in the self.
He remains the same, in desirable and undesirable
circumstances viz., pleasure and pain, which appear as the fruit
of his past actions. They cannot make him happy and sad.
'Svasthah'—In the self, there is neither pleasure nor pain. The
self, is their illuminator. He remains established in the self.
'‘SamalostaSmakaficanah'—He has neither attachment nor
aversion, to a clod of earth, a piece of stone and a piece of
"
1627,"1572 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter14
«» gold. He makes proper use of these but remains alike, in their
4 gain and loss. Not to know the distinction between a clod of
earth, a stone and gold is not, even-mindedness. Having known
their distinction, not to have attraction and aversion for them, :
is even-mindedness. The knowledge of their distinction is not a
fault, but to be affected by these is an evil.
'Tulyapriyapriyah'—He remains alike, in success and failure,
which he gets, as the fruit of his actions. | |
'Tulyanindatmasamstutih'—Praise and blame, mainly relate to ,
name. The man beyond gunas has no connection at all, with the ,
name. He is neither pleased, when he is praised, nor displeased
when he is blamed. He has neither attachment for those, who praise
him nor aversion to those, who blame him. It is a common trait,
that a man likes praise but dislikes blame. He who rises above ~
gunas, knows the two, but he treats both of these alike. He remains
established, in the self, where praise and blame, have no access. __
Both praise and blame, are activities done by others. To be
pleased or displeased with these is a mistake. Whatever one's nature
is, and whatever his conviction is, he will speak, accordingly.
It is not just if a striver, expects of others, that they should not
censure him. It is rather unjust, if he compels other persons to
praise him, and not to blame him. He should be pleased, when :
someone blames him, because in that case his sins are wiped out |
and he is purified. When someone praises him, then his virtues
are destroyed. So, he should not be pleased, with praise, because
it involves danger. | :
_ ""Manapamanayostulyah'—A person, regards honour and
dishonour of a body or a name as his own, when he identifies
himself, with the body. But the person, who has transcended the
modes, having snapped his connection with the body, is neither
pleased with honour nor displeased with dishonour, because he
remains established in the self, which is free from all alterations
and modifications. So he feels neither happy whenhe ishonoured, = = =
"
1628,"Verse 24-25} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 157300
nor sad, when he is dishonoured. He remains alike. To have.
knowledge of honour and dishonour, is not an evil. But to be
happy and unhappy, is an evil. Both are modifications of nature.

'Tulyo mitraripaksayoh'—He entertains no feeling of friendship .
or enmity, towards anyone. But, people find their own sentiments :
of friendship or enmity, reflected in him. So, even by knowing |
the fact that some other persons, regard him as their friend or
enemy, he maintains an attitude of impartiality, towards them.

If he has to divide a thing, between two—one, who regards :
him as a friend and the other, who regards him as an enemy, he -
gives a bit less to the former, than to the latter, because he is -
generous to the latter, even in judgement. This is also, equanimity .
or even-mindedness. 7

'Sarvarambhaparityagi'—He abandons all new undertakings a
for pleasure and prosperity. He performs actions, according to
circumstances, being free from feelings of egoism, attachment,
having no desire for their fruit, and abandons these, without -
having any desire for praise and honour etc.

'Gunatitah sa ucyate'—Such a person, is said to have risen -
above, the three gunas (modes of nature).

In fact, the person, who has transcended the three modes
of nature, cannot, have any marks. Marks vest in the modes of
prakrti or in prakrti. How can he, who has marks, transcend
gunas? Arjuna, has inquired of the marks, of such a person. The
Lord has described those marks. In fact, these are marks of his
so-called inner sense, and body. These marks, are only hints |
about such a person. They cannot describe him. The modes, are
the evolutes of nature, while a body. senses, mind and intellect,
are the evolutes of modes. So the senses, mind and intellect
cannot even, fully describe the modes which are, their cause.

How can these describe prakrti, the cause of modes? Then, how
is it possible for these to describe the one, who has transcended
the modes?
"
1629,"1574 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 14 -

Here the Lord, has mentioned four pairs of opposites—pleasure
and pain, pleasant and unpleasant, praise and blame and honour and

- dishonour, to denote that one who becomes equanimous in them, :
he becomes equanimous in other pairs of opposites, also easily. A |
person, having transcended the three modes, regards these pairs :
alike. He always remains balanced, and his peace, is never disturbed.

[In the twenty-fourth and the twenty-fifth verses, the Lord
has described equanimity, of a great person, who has transcended
the three modes of nature. ]

Appendix—Flaws such as attachment and aversion neither |
abide in the non-Self nor in the Self nor they are the intrinsic -
characteristic of the mind but they abide in the ego (identification
of the Self with the body). In fact there is no real identification
but it is merely assumed out of indiscrimination. It means that -
there are no flaws in the Self but a man assumes them in the
Self because of indiscrimination. He realizes that flaws appear
and disappear, while the Self ever exists as it is; but he does not -
attach importance to this realization. If he discriminately realizes
that the Seif is free from these flaws, he will not become their .
experiencer (happy and sad).

[Though the Lord, discussed the means of rising above the

modes, in the nineteenth and the twentieth verses of this chapter,
yet Arjuna, in the twenty-first verse again asked the question:
What is the means of attaining to the transcendental position? It
means, that Arjuna wants to know of any other means, besides .
the one, already discussed. Therefore, the Lord regarding Arjuna .
as eligible for devotion, explains the path of devotion.]
‘Mah ca yo'vyabhicarena bhaktiyogena sevate'—In this
clause the term 'Yah' (Who), denotes the server (worshipper),
the term ‘Mam' (Me), denotes the worshipped and the expression |
‘Avyabhicarena bhaktiyogena sevate'’, denotes exclusive devotion |
(worship). In exclusive devotion—a devotee, without depending -
either on the world or even on the Discipline of Knowledge, and
devotion, etc., depends only on God, and takes refuge only in Him. |
‘Sa gunansamatityaitan'—He, who worships the Lord, with -
exclusive devotion, has not to rise above the three modes, but
by the Lord's grace the modes are automatically transcended,
by him (Gita 12/6-7).
""Brahmabhiyaya kalpate'—Having transcended the modes, he
becomes eligible for attaining, Brahma. Here the Lord, has talked ""
about devotion. So He should have said, that the devotee becomes
eligible for attaining Him, instead of saying that he becomes
eligible for attaining Brahma. The reason is, that Arjuna asked
the means of transcending the modes (attainment of Brahma, the
Absolute). So, the Lord answered accordingly.
Also in the scriptures it is mentioned, that he who worships the
Lord, with exclusive devotion, has not to adopt any other means, .
even in the Discipline of Knowledge, for becoming eligible to attain -
Brahma. He automatically, becomes eligible to attain Brahma. But
a devotee is not satisfied with this attainment, he wants to please
the Lord. He regards the Lord's pleasure, as his own pleasure.
It means, that one who surrenders himself to the Lord, becomes
eligible, for attaining Brahma, automatically. This is something
different, whether he attaches importance to this attainment, or not.
"
1631,"1576 : SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 14

Appendix—Whatever a striver wants to attain that is all
attained by devotion. The striver who predominantly wants to
attain Brahma viz., salvation or enlightenment, he attains Brahma
by devotion because God 1s the abode of Brahma (Gita 14/27). |
Brahma is an integral part of the entire form of God (Gita 7/29-30). |
In the tenth verse of the thirteenth chapter also the Lord has
declared that exclusive devotion is a means to Self-realization. ~
In Srimadbhagavata the worship of God Who is endowed
with attributes, has been mentioned ‘nirguna’ (transcending the
modes); as—‘manniketarh tu nirgunam’ (11/25/25), ‘matsevayarn tu -
nirguna’ (11/25/27) etc. Therefore he, who worships God endowed
with attributes, transcends the three gunas (modes). God endowed
with attributes is not dependent on attributes but attributes are -
dependent on Him. He who is swayed (controlled) by Sattva-
Raja-Tama, is not ‘Saguna’ (God endowed with attributes), but .
Saguna is He Who is endowed with endless divine qualities such
as limitless grandeur, sweetness, loveliness and generosity etc.
Sattvika, Rajasa and Tamasa actions can be performed by God
but He is not controlled by those modes. |
A dovotee by having an inclination to God, naturally and
easily transcends the modes of nature. Not only this, he also
comes to know the entire form of God. .

Imperishable, of eternal Dharma (Law or righteousness) and of -
absolute bliss. 27 | |
Comment:— |
'Brahmano hi pratisthaham'—When Lord Krsna declares,
that He is the abode of Brahma, He means to say, that He has
His identity, with Brahma. As burning fire which is seen, and
fire present in a piece of wood which is not seen, are one and |
the same, similarly the Lord is the same, as endowed with form -
and also, without form. As the nose smells the same food, while
the tongue tastes it, similarly the same Lord is Brahma, for a |
devotee following the Discipline of Knowledge, and Lord Krsna ”
for a devotee of devotion. :
In fact Lord Krsna and Brahma, are one and the same.
The Lord has used the term ‘Brahma’, for Himself in 5/10 and
also 'unmanifested form’ in 9/4. So He is both with form and
without form.
'Amrtasyavyayasya ca'—The Lord, is Immortal and
imperishable. It means, that. the Immortal and the Imperishable
are not two different entities, but one and the same. The same
immortality, has been described in 13/12 and 14/20. |
'Sasvatasya ca dharmasya'—Lord Krsna, is the abode of eternal
Dharma, and eternal Dharma, is the abode of the Lord. It means
that the Lord and eternal Dharma, are one and the same.* In |
* There are four important Dharmas (Religions) in the world. They are
Hindi (Sanatana or Eternal), Bauddha, Christian and Muslim. The founders
of Bauddha, Christian and Muslim religions are Buddha, Jesus Christ and
Mohammada respectively. But the Sanatana Dharma was not originated by
anyone, it is eternal and beginningless like the Lord. This.is a discovery by
high sages. What is discovered, has its own pre-existence. The methods of God-
realization described in other Dharmas are also the gift of 'Sanatana Dharma’.

‘Sukhasyaikantikasya ca'—Lord Krsna, 1s the abode of absolute =
bliss, and absolute bliss, is the abode of the Lord. The same
absolute bliss, has been called eternal bliss (5/21), supreme bliss
(6/21) and infinite bliss (6/28).

In this verse, in the expression 'Brahmanah' and ‘Amrtasya’, |
like the expression ‘Rahoh Sirah’, the sixth inflexion has been used, |
which means that 'Rahu' and ‘Sirah’ (head), are not two different
entities, but both are, one and the same. Similarly, here Brahma, ~

_the Immortal, the Imperishable, is Lord Krsna and Lord Krsna is
Brahma, the Immortal, the Imperishable. In this verse, emphasis
has been laid on the identity of Lord Krsna, with Brahma, the -
Imperishable and the Eternal Dharma etc. All of them, in spite
of being called, by different names, are one and the same. Thus,

a devotee, who worships Lord Krsna, attains Brahma. :

INTRODUCTION

In response to Arjuna's question, ""Those devotees who worship
Thee with attributes and those who worship the Absolute (the
Imperishable and the Unmanifested)—which of them are better
versed in Yoga?"" The Lord declared the former to be superior =
to the latter. In the fifth verse, the Lord while comparing the -
two declared, ""The difficulty of those whose thoughts are set, on
the Unmanifested is greater, for the goal of the Unmanifested,
is hard to reach by the embodied beings."" How to overcome
this difficulty of body consciousness—this topic, as well as, the. -
description of the Absolute has been given, in the thirteenth and
the fourteenth chapters.

In the twenty-first verse of the fourteenth chapter Arjuna asked,
""What are the marks and conduct of him, who has transcended ;
the three modes (gunas) and how does he transcend them?"" In
response to this, the Lord after discussing the marks and conduct
of the person who has transcended the three modes, in verses
twenty-second to the twenty-fifth, im the twenty-sixth verse He
explained unadultered devotion, as the means to transcend, the
three modes, for the devotees who worship God with attributes.
It means, that devotee who has exclusive devotion to God (who
totally depends upon Him) transcends the three modes easily. -
The expression 'Avyabhicarena bhaktiyogena’, stands for devotion
free from dependence on the world, the term 'Yah' stands for
the embodied soul, while the term 'Mam' stands for God. In the
fifteenth chapter these very three subjects have been described
in detail which are referred in brief just above.

Man (soul) being a fragment of God, is transcendental but
he is bound because of his identification with, and attachment to ee
"
1637,"1582 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 15 |
the body (world)—the evolute of the modes. He is not liberated
from these modes, so long as he does not know the glory of
the Lord, the transcendental one. Therefore, the Lord, introduces
the fifteenth chapter in order, to explain His glory and secret, to -
enable a striver to cultivate unswerving devotion.
A man (soul), is a fragment of God (Gita 15/7) and so he has
his affinity, only for God. But by error, he assumes his affinity
for the body, senses, mind and intellect, etc., which are evolutes
of Nature, by regarding them as 'T’, or ‘mine’, or for me. This .
is the main stumbling block, to exclusive devotion. In order to ;
remove this stumbling block, the Lord in the first five verses of -
the fifteenth chapter, having described the universe as a Pipala
tree, exhorts Arjuna, to cut it down with an axe of dispassion.

The Blessed Lord said _
He who knows the Pipala tree which is said to be imperishable,
as having its root above and branches below, and whose leaves are
the Vedas, is the knower of the Vedas. 1
Comment:— :
'Urdhvamilamadhahsakham'— [Like the first two verses
of the thirteenth chapter, here in the first verse of the fifteenth
chapter also the Lord presents a view of all the topics of the
entire chapter. The expression 'Urdhvamiilam' denotes God; the
expression 'Adhahsakham' denotes Brahma, the representative
of all beings while the term 'ASvattham' denotes the world. He
who knows the omnipotent Lord (the root of the Pipala tree in
"
1638,"Verse 1] _SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1583 -
form of the universe) in reality has been called 'Vedavit' (knower
of the Vedas).

Generally trees have their roots below and branches above.

But this tree in the form of the universe is strange as it has its :
root above and branches below. The supreme abode of God from |
where there is no return is above all the other worlds. Brahma is

the main branch (stem) of the tree in the form of the world as

he emanates first of all. The abode of Brahma is lower than that -

of God. Brahma is lower than God in position, virtues, rank and

age etc., so he is called 'Adhah'.* As the root is the foundation 7
(support) of the entire . tree, so is God the origin of the entire -
universe. Brahma, the creator is born of Him and he has been
described by the expression 'Adhahsakham’ (branches below). |

God is the illuminator and base of the entire creation and _
He is superior to everyone in everyway. ""There is none equal
to Thee, how could then there be one superior to Thee in the
three worlds"" (Gita 11/43)T? Being the base and the support of |
the entire universe He is called 'Urdhvamilam' (root above).

The term ‘Mila’ stands for the root or the base. The universe -
is born of Him and is preserved by Him. He is eternal, infinite
and the base of the entire creation. He resides in His eternal
abode, which is situated above all the worlds in His manifested
form with attributes. So He is known as 'Urdhva’. This world
is born of Him and therefore it is called 'Urdhvamila’ having
its root above. 7 -

As trunks, branches and tendrils sprout from the root of
the tree, so does the entire universe emanate from God. It is
expanded by Him, it remams established in Him and it is by
His power that beings actf. Having taken refuge in such Lord,

_ * The expression 'AdhahSakham’' includes all creatures from Brahma to insects.
TNo one appears either to be superior or equal to Him (God). |

+ This fact has been mentioned in the Gita when Lord Krsna declares, ""I

am the source and dissolution of the entire universe"" (7/6), ""I am the origin,
"
1639,"1584 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 15 |
a person is satisfied forever:(the Lord talks of taking refuge in
Him in the fourth verse). SS Lora
At the time of creation Brahma, the creator accepts Prakrti |
but he remains liberated from it as he has no attachment to it. .
Except Brahma all the other beings having affinity of 'T’ness and
‘mineness’ for Prakrti (nature) and its evolute body etc., are bound
and take birth and then die again and again 1.e., their branches
spread downward. The three kinds of birth because of the three
modes of goodness, of passion and of ignorance are included in |
the expression 'Adhahsakham (Gita 14/18). |
""ASvattham'—The term ‘Asvattham' has two meanings— ~
(1) That which may not last even by tomorrow i.e., kaleidoscopic*
and (2) Pipala tree. | | :
According to the first interpretation the universe does not -
remain fixed even for a 'Ksana't (moment), it is kaleidoscopic,
the seen is changing into the unseen. It seems to exist like
a mirage. The mere change appears as creation, existence or
dissolution. It is because of its kaleidoscopic nature, that it is
called 'Asvattham’. °
According to the second interpretation the universe has
been called a Pipala tree. In the scriptures, this tree has been
glorified very much. The Lord, declares while describing His
divine manifestations, ‘Among all the trees I am the 'Aévattha'
(Pipala)' (Gita 10/26). If the plants of Pipala, myrobalan and
of the universe"" (9/18), ""I am the source of all; from Me everything evolves”
(9/10), ""The ancient activity or energy streamed forth from Him"" (15/4), ""From
Him all beings have evolved” (18/46).
* The term 'Svah' stands for tomorrow. That which continues by tomorrow
is ‘Svattha’ and that which does not last even by tomorrow is 'Agvattha’.
{The philosophers have explained the term 'Ksana' (moment) in the
following way—a needle pricks the lotus leaf in three moments—touch in
the first moment, making the hole in the second moment, and palling the other
side of the leaf in the third moment.
"
1640,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1585 -
basil, are worshipped by regarding them as divine, their worship
becomes, worship of God. . :

God is the root of the universe, and therefore this Pipala |
tree, in the form of the universe, being a manifestation of God, .
deserves to be worshipped. The worship of Pipala tree, in the
form of universe is to render service to it, without having any
desire to derive pleasure, out of it. This world is a manifestation
of God, for those who do not desire to derive pleasure out of
it—All is God (Gita. 7/19). But this world, is the abode of
sorrow, for those who desire to derive pleasure out of it, because 7
they (the self), are imperishable, while the world is perishable, -
transitory or kaleidoscopic. Therefore, the objects of the world
cannot satisfy the self, and the people have to follow a cycle of |
birth and death. So everyone, should render service to the world,
without expecting any reward from it. |

'‘Prahuravyayam'—This tree, in the form of the world, is called
imperishable, because in spite of being perishable, its beginning
and end, are not known, its flow is continuous (eternal), and its
root is imperishable God. As the water of sea evaporates, with :
the heat of sun, changes into a cloud, falls on the ground in
the form of rain, and flows into the sea again, in the form of a
stream or a river and the process continues endlessly, so does the
cycle of the world go on, without any end. This cycle moves so
rapidly, that just like a movie in spite of, being kaleidoscopic,
it seems fixed.

This tree in the form of this world, is called imperishable, |
but in fact, it is not so. Had it been imperishable, the Lord, in
the third verse of this chapter, would not have declared, ""Its form
is not perceived here, as it is said"" nor would He have inspired
Arjuna to cut off this firm rooted Pipala tree, with a strong axe
of non-attachment.

'Chandamsi yasya parnani'—The Vedas, are the leaves of this
tree, in the form of the universe. Here, the Vedas, mean the portion
"
1641,"1586 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 15 |
of the Vedas which deal with rituals and their performance, for
the fruits.* As trees, with flowers and leaves without bearing
any fruits cannot satisfy people, so can mundane pleasure and
prosperity, looking beautiful outwardly, like flowers and leaves, -
not provide imperishable bliss.
Virtuous actions performed, in order to attain, heaven are
better than forbidden actions, but they cannot lead to salvation |
as those people having enjoyed the vast heaven, enter the world
of mortals, when their merit is exhausted (Gita 9/21). Thus, such
actions and their fruits—both are perishable. Therefore, a striver, :
should realize God, by becoming detached from both of them. -
Leaves are born of the branches of a tree, and they protect
and nourish it. They beautify it and strengthen it (the movement |
of leaves strengthen its root, stem and branches). The Vedas, are -
also born of Brahma, the main branch of this tree, in the form
of the world and actions sanctioned by the Vedas, nourish and
protect the world. So, the Vedas, have been called leaves. When
actions, are performed with a desire for fruit, these lead him to
heaven. This is nourishment of the tree. In heaven, there are .
celestial damsels and gardens etc. This is the beauty of that tree.
The performance of actions for their fruit leads to the cycle
of birth and death—this is strengthening of this tree.
Here the Lord means to say, that a striver, instead of getting
entangled in the leaves, in the form of performance of actions
for their fruit, should depend only on God, the root of the tree.
Having depended on God, he realizes the reality about the Vedas, |
which deal with the Supreme Being, rather than the world or |
heaven (Gita 15/15).t+
*In the Vedas the number of the hymns which deal with the fruit of
actions, is eighty thousand while the number of the hymns which lead to
salvation, is twenty thousand. Out of these twenty thousand hymns, there are
four thousand on the path of knowledge, and sixteen thousand, on the path
of devotion. : :
tT The Vedas ascertain the Supreme Person Who is the supreme goal.
"
1642,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1587 —
'Yastam veda sa vedavit'—He who knows this tree, in the
form of the universe, knows the reality, about the Vedas. The
real knowledge of the world, consists in knowing the world, as
kaleidoscopic and also having no desire of deriving any pleasure _
out of it. When a man realizes, that the world is transitory :
(unreal), he cannot derive any pleasure out of it. While enjoying
the sense-objects, he does not realize the world, to be transitory.
A man depends on the world and has a desire to derive pleasure,
out of it only by regarding the worldly beings and objects, as
real. When he realizes, its true character he has a disinclination for =
the world, and an inclination to God, and he realizes his identity, .
with God. Such a person, is a knower of the Vedas. The person -
who has only studied the Vedas, may be a scholar, but he has not |
really known, the Vedas. The real knower of the Vedas, is he who
having renounced his affinity, for the world, has realized God. ~
The Lord in the fifteenth verse of this chapter, has declared
that He Himself is the knower of the Vedas. Thus the Lord .
identifies, such a man, who knows the reality about the world,
with Him by calling him a knower of the Vedas. It means, that
discrimination bestowed upon human beings, is so glorious that :
a person having known the reality about the world can become
the knower of the Vedas, like God.*
The man (soul), being a fr&tment of God, has only affinity,
for God. He has assumed his affinity for the world by an error.
He, who through discrimination having rectified this error i.e.,
having renounced his assumed affinity, for the world, has realized
his self-evident identity, with God, knows the reality about the
tree in the form of the world, and he has been called 'Vedavit'
(the knower of the Vedas), by the Lord. :
Appendix—The world, the Soul and the Supreme Soul—all the
three are only God—‘Vasudevah sarvam’. It has been described
*The same fact has been pointed out by the Lord when He declares,
""They have attained unity with Me"" (Gita 14/2).
"
1643,"1588 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 15 -
here in the form of a tree. |

In spite of being kaleidoscopic, the purpose of calling the
world ‘avyaya’ (imperishable) is that though the world undergoes
changes constantly, yet nothing is spent out of it viz., it does not
know any diminution. As in the sea, several waves appear to rise -
and there are tides also, but water of the sea remains the same, it
neither decreases nor increases. Similarly though it appears that
the world constantly undergoes changes, yet it remain. ‘avyaya’
(unspent). The reason is that the kaleidoscopic world also being 7
the evolute of God’s power ‘apara prakrti’ is the manifestation of
God-—‘sadasaccahamarjuna’ (Gita 9/19). Both—the kaleidoscopic -
‘apara prakrti’ (lower nature) as well as the unchangeable ‘para
prakrti’ (higher nature) is God’s manifestation. This world isin , .
the form of waves in God-ocean. As in the ocean, the waves
appear rising outwardly only; inside the ocean, there are no waves, -
the ocean remains calm and uniform, similarly outwardly the
world appears to be kaleidoscopic, yet within it, there is God
Who is ever calm and uniform (Gita 13/27). It means that the
world as the world is not imperishable but it is imperishable as
the manifestation of God. A glimpse of God appears in the form
of the world. A striver instead of catching that glimpse (world),
should be inclined to God. To cognise the reality of that glimpse,
to value it and to be attached to it lead to bondage.

Another purpose of using the term ‘avyaya’ is that the person
who gets attached to the world, his cycle of birth and death will
also be imperishable viz., will never come to an end. The long
path can come to an end but how can be round path end? As :
a bullock used in a crusher goes on moving round and round
without an end, similarly the person attached to the world will
go on following the cycle of birth and death endlessly.

The world is ‘avyaya’ because the seed of the world is
‘avyaya’—‘bijamavyayam’ (Gita 9/18).

Its branches nourished by the modes, with sense-objects for
its buds (twigs) extend below and above and the roots which bind -
the soul according to its actions in the human body stretch forth
in all regions higher or lower. 2 :
Comment:—
""Tasya §akha gunapravrddhah'—Brahma, is the main branch .
of the tree of creation. All beings such as the gods, men and other
lower species, are born of Brahma, the Creator. So, all the worlds
from the abode of Brahma, down to the nethermost-region and
all the beings, such as the gods, persons and germs etc., living in
them, are branches of that tree of creation. As branches of tree
spread, when they are watered, so do the branches of creation
spread, by attachment to the modes which are responsible for
one's birth in good, medium and evil bodies (Gita 13/21; 14/18). |
In the entire creation, there is no place, object or person, that is .
free from the three modes of nature (Gita 18/40). It is because of
attachment for the modes that the world, seems to exist. The modes
can be experienced by inclination and objects, born of the modes.
Therefore, the Lord by using the expression 'Gunapravrddhah’,
wants to explain, that so long as, a man is attached to the modes, in
"
1645,"1590 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 15 -
the least, the branches of tree of creation, will go on extending. So,
in order to, cut off this tree, a striver, should not be at all attached,

to the modes, otherwise he cannot renounce his attachment, to

the world. : |

'Visayapravalah'—The inclinations of the modes as well :
as all palpable objects are included in 'Visayapravalah' (sense-
objects as buds). As a stem grows from the root, branches from
the stem and buds from the branches, and again, branches extend
from, buds, so are sense-objects, buds of this tree of universe. A
person, thinks of the sense-objects, because of the three modes. As :
water in the form of modes nourishes, and extends the branches -
of the tree of creation, so does it nourish and extend, the buds
of sense-objects. As buds, are seen but water which pervades

| these is not seen, so, are tile objects of the senses with their |
characteristics of sound etc., seen, but the modes are not seen, -
they are known by the sense-objects. ,

The expression 'Visayapravalah' means that a man cannot -
renounce attachment for the world, so long as, he thinks of sense-
objects (Gita 2/62-63). “Thinking of, whatever being, a person, -

_at the end gives up his body to that being does he attain"" (Gita
8/6). So if he thinks of sense-objects, the thought, will lead him
to bondage. This birth is like sprouting of buds.

Like buds, sense-objects also appear beautiful, so a man is
attracted to them. A striver, by applying his discrimination, can
easily renounce those objects, by knowing these as transitory
and sources of sorrow (Gita 5/22). It is because of attachment to
them, that they appear beautiful and attractive; in fact they are |
not so. Therefore, renouncement of attachment for them is real :
renouncement. As a person, has not to work hard, in destroying
soft buds, so should a striver, not think it difficult to renounce,
these sense-objects. They are just like poisonous sweet-dishes,
which may appear sweet and attractive but are deadly.* So a
_ *Sense-objects are more poisonous than a cobra because poison kills a
"
1646,"Verse 2] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1591 .
striver, should totally renounce thinking of sense-objects, and
enjoying them, in order to cut off this tree of creation.*
'AdhaScordhvam prasrta'—Here, the term 'Ca' (and), should
mean the middle world i.e., mortal, human world (as described .
by the expression 'Manusyaloke karmanubandhini' in this verse).
The term 'Urdhvam’', stands for the abode of Brahma, where
one can go by two paths—the northern path (the path of light
known as Devayana), and the southern path (the path of darkness
known as Pitryana), described as light and dark paths, in twenty-
fourth and the twenty-fifth verses of eighth chapter. The term -
'‘Adhah', stands for hells which are also of two kinds—by birth -
and by place. |
This expression, explains that branches of the tree of creation, |
having its root in God above, extended in all directions, below, -
above and in the middle. Out of these the main branch is human
life, in which a human being is authorized to perform new actions,
while in other births, he has to reap the fruit of his past actions. :
In human life, he can either, rise above (to upper region) or go
below (to the lower region—hell) or even attain God, the highest -
state, by cutting off the tree of creation. It depends upon him,
whether he attains God, by attaching importance to discrimination,
or paves the way to hell, by enjoying pleasure foolishly. Therefore, _
saint Tulasidasa in the Manasa declares, “This human life is
a ladder, either to hell or heaven or to attain salvation, and it
endows us with knowledge, dispassion and devotion, which lead
to benediction” (7/121/5). :
‘Adhasca miillanyanusantatani karmanubandhini manusyaloke'—
All the other lives, except human life, are to reap the fruit of
past actions in the form of pleasure and pain. A man, has to
man when it enters his body while sense-objects affect him when he merely
sees them.
*If you want to attain salvation, you should renounce sense-objects from
a distance regarding them as poisonous.

take birth in good and evil wombs, in order to reap the fruit . of
- his virtues and evil actions. In human life, he can perform either
virtuous or evil actions, or may attain salvation, by being free
from virtues and evils. . | .
Here the term ‘Milani’, stands for the root in the form of ego,
attachment and desire, rather than for God. A man, identifies the
self with the body, is attached to body etc., and has desire for
family, prosperity, name and fame etc. He wants his memorial,
even after giving up this mortal body. Other species, also possess |
these desires to some or more extent, but they bind a being only
in human life.* When a person performs actions, inspired by -
* These three (1) The desire to have a vision of God (God-realization)
or devotion to God (2) The desire for Self-realization and (3) The desire to
render selfless- service to others, are not desires because the self and God are —
ever attained, and are one's own. As taking money from one’s own pocket is
not theft, so is the desire for Self-realization or God-realization not a desire.
Similarly, the desire to use the worldly objects in rendering service to the /
world, is renunciation rather than, desire. The desire for attaining what is one's
own and imperishable, is a necessity (hunger), while the desire to give those
objects, which are others’ and perishable to them, is renunciation. As desire for ;
food, is a necessity for the body, rather than a desire, so is desire of God to
satisfy the hunger of the self not a desire. There is a desire for the insentient
(Matter), while there is necessity (hunger) for the sentient. A desire is never
satisfied, it is rather enhanced and so it is to be renounced, while necessity
is satisfied (fulfilled) by anyone of the three paths—of action, of knowledge
and of devotion. A man become, a slave to the world, by regarding worldly
persons and objects, as his. If he has the aim of using them in rendering
service to others, by regarding them as theirs, he will be liberated from slavery
(dependence)—This is path of action. The soul is a fragment of God, but It
being attached to the perishable objects, has deviated from Him. If a person
renounces his attachment to perishable persons and objects, he will realize
the self—this is known as path of knowledge. By having inclination for the
world, he has a disinclination for God. If he accepts the fact that he is only
God's and only God is his, devotion to God will be aroused in him—This
is path of devotion. It means, that a man being attached to the perishable
world, has become a slave to the world, has deviated from the self and has
a disinclination for God. If he does not accept the world as his (which ts not
really his), he will cease to be a slave to the world, will realize the self and
will attain God-realization, or devotion to Him.
"
1648,"Verse 2] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI - 1593 -
desires, impressions of these actions, accumulate in his mind
‘ and induce him to the cycle of birth and death. A man, has
to reap the fruit of actions performed, during this life, here, as
well as hereafter (Gita 18/12). So a man,-cannot be free from
the bondage of actions, so long as he has identity with body and ""
he is attached to the world and cherishs desires. A striver, has
to cut off identity, attachment and desire, and has to depend on
God, Who is the creator and base of the universe. The same, has
been described in fourth verse of this chapter, by the expression
""I seek refuge in the Primal Person."" As a man, is bound in this -
human life, so can he be free in this life in the same way, as a .
knot can be untied, at a point at which it is tied. | -
The roots of the tree of creation in the form of ego, attachment
and desire extend below and above, in all the worlds, among all
beings. Birds and beasts, also have identity with thew bodies, -
are attached to their offspring and have a desire, to eat delicious
food when hungry. Similarly, the gods have identity with their
divine bodies, are attached to heavenly pleasure and have a
desire to acquire, more and more pleasure. Thus, all beings
have identity, attachment and desire in one form or the other. -
But they do not bind other beings, except mankind. Though
other beings, such as the gods etc., also possess discrimination,
yet they do not use it, because overwhelmed by.pleasures in
abundance and their enjoyment. So they cannot realize that they
(the self) are devoid of those evils while a man can realize that
he (the self) is different from or devoid of all such defects as,
ego, attachment and desire. .
~ Aman possesses the ability of realizing the bad consequences -
of the enjoyment of pleasure. The man who enjoys pleasures
without thinking of their consequences is worse than a beast,
because a beast paves the way to human life by reaping the fruit
of its past actions, while a man is paving the way to birth in the
womb of beasts, by enjoying forbidden pleasures. .

in the scriptures also, it is mentioned, that persons who perform
virtuous actions, in order to reap their fruit, enjoy mundane and
heavenly pleasure, in abundance. Having heard such statements,
a person, feels that the human world and paradise, are pleasant
and permanent. So he desires sense-objects, and is filled with
insatiable desires, he holds that there is nothing else, beyond |
sensual enjoyments (Gita 2/42; 16/11). An ignorant person, ;
has this feelings so long as, he has ego, attachment and desire
with the world or body. But the Lord declares, that when a
striver, perceives it, by separating the self from the world Le.,
by renouncing his affinity for it, he does not perceive it as
imperishable and pleasant, but he. perceives it as perishable
and unpleasant. |

a person not know the origin and end of the world, by having -
attachment to it.

All the means (senses, mind and intellect), to perceive the
origin and end of the world, are fragments of the world. So
they cannot know the world, in the same way as a jar of clay,
cannot absorb the earth, within it. Therefore, when a man (the — -
self), separates himself from the world (mind, intellect and sense), ~
he knows the world, in reality.

In fact, the world has no independent existence. It is only a
process of birth and death. This process, appears as its existence. _
If a further thought, is given to it, it will be experienced, that
there is no birth, there is only decay. When it does not stay, in
one form even for a moment, how can it be called existent? It -
seems to exist, because of a. striver's attachment, to the world.

As soon as, this attachment is renounced, the seeming existence, .
disappears and a striver realizes the self or God.

No scientist has perceived the beginning, the middle and the
end of universe, till today, nor can he perceive it. If a person,
having attachment to the world and enjoying mundane pleasure,
wants to perceive the beginning, middle and end, of it all, his
efforts, are in vain. | | .

In fact, there is no need to perceive the beginning, the
middle and the end of this universe, there is need to renounce,
the assumed affinity, for it.

Philosophers differ in their opinions, whether the universe is
without beginning and perishable, or beginningless and infinite
or illusory, but all of them agree, that our affinity for it is unreal
"
1651,"1596 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 15
(assumed), which must be, renounced. 7

An easy way to renounce this assumed affinity, for the
world is that materials (mind, intellect, senses, body, riches
and property etc.,) acquired from the world, should be used in =
rendering service, to the world.

All mundane materials, such as women, sons, honour, praise,
wealth, property, long life, good health and abundant pleasure
cannot satisfy a person, because he (the self), is imperishable, |
while ali the mundane pleasures are perishable. How can the .
imperishable be satisfied, by the perishable? : :

‘ASvatthamenam suviridhamilam'—It is because of ego, -
attachment and desire with it that the universe (having no |
foundation), seems firm rooted.

Attachment and senses of mineness to beings, objects -
and actions etc., strengthens worldly bondage. Because of his
attachment one identifies himself, with them. After amassing /
riches he thinks ""I am very rich"" but when his wealth is lost
he holds that he has been ruined. Out of greed, he performs
forbidden actions and commits sins, in order to, hoard money. :
Then he has a conviction that he cannot earn money without
foul means, as falsehood, fraud and dishonesty etc. He ceases to
think, that the money earned by foul means, will have to be left
behind it while evils, such as falsehood, fraud and dishonesty
etc., will accompany him, to the next world* and will lead him
to a miserable life, here as well as, hereafter. Not only this, but
he also instigates other people, to earn money by foul means,
calling it a business by justifying falsehood and fraud etc., for it. -
This evil feeling (faith), is a firm root of the branches of, ego,
attachment and desire. This evil feeling (faith), makes him evil,

* When a person gives up his body, the wealth remains lying in shelves,
animals remain tied here and there, his wife accompanies him to the gate,
sons go upto the cremation ground, the body to the pyre while it is only one's
righteousness (Dharma) which accompanies him to the next world.
"
1652,"Verse 3] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1597 :
because the Lord declares, ""What a man's faith is, that verily,
He is"" (Gita 17/3). :
The branches of ego, attachment and desire, are so firmly
rooted, that they cannot be, totally rooted. out, through study of .
the scriptures, or by listening to divine discourses and thinking.
Strivers, while listening to religious discourses, think of renouncing
these evils, but in practical life they find themselves, unable
to renounce these. The reason is, that they want to renounce
these as well as enjoy mundane pleasures, from persons and
objects etc., like a greedy person, who wants to relish a sweet :
dish mixed with poison and yet escape from poison. But it is -
impossible. When a striver, has no desire at all to derive any
kind of pleasure from the world, this firm rooted tree of the
universe is naturally rooted out. _
Further, a striver believes that it is very difficult to get rid
of these evils, of identification, attachment and desire. But the
fact, is that these defects automatically, vanish, they cannot stay, |
as these are by nature transient. So a striver should never think
that it is difficult to renounce, them. -
‘Asangagastrena drdhena chittva'—The Lord declares, that
though the tree of creation is firm rooted, it can be cut off with
a strong sword (axe) of non-attachiment. A man may be attached
to a place, person, object or circumstance etc., because of their
attraction, and because of the desire to derive pleasure out of
these. Absence of attachment, is non-attachment or dispassion. This
dispassion, can be of two kinds (1) Common (ii) Strong. Strong
dispassion is also called 'Uparati' (indifference) or ‘Para vairagya’. -
An Important Fact
A man, may abandon his house and property physically, but
if he attaches importance to them, from his heart or if he feels
proud that he is a renouncer, it means that he is not dispassionate.
"
1653,"1598 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 15 :

When he has not the least attachment to them, and he has no

attraction towards them—this is dispassion. OO :
Secondly, he should be detached from his so-called parents, :

wife, sons, brothers and-friends etc. He should accept his affinity,  ~

for them in order to render service to them, rather than to have

a desire to acquire anything from them for his selfish motive.

_ Thirdly, there is detachment from the body. This is real
detachment. If there is attachment for the body, it means that
there is attachment for the entire universe, because the body is |
the seed, of the entire universe. Absence of identification with :
the body, is detachment (dispassion), from the body. ~

_ In order to renounce this identification with the body (egoism),
first a striver, should renounce the desire for honour, praise and
riches etc. Even when a striver, renounces the desire for honour, -
praise and fame etc., here, because of nis subtle desire, he wants
his name and fame to be maintained, through memorials etc.,
after his death. All these desires must be renounced. Sometimes -
a striver, is envious or jealous of others. That envy or jealousy
should also be renounced. | | °
Even when, these desires are renounced, a man may remain
attached to his body, even after he has given up the body. So the
bones of the dead body are immersed into the Ganges, after the :
body is burnt, so that one may meet with a good fate. When .
a man through discrimination, realizes, that the sentient soul
is different, from the insentient body, his attachment or sense
of 'mine'’, is renounced. When both desire and attachment are
renounced, ego almost vanishes i.e., it remains, only in its, subtle :
form. It totally perishes, when a devotee attains God-realization
or real exclusive devotion, to God.
When a man realizes, ‘I am neither body nor the body is
mine,’ desire, attachment and identification—the three perish.
This is real detachment or dispassion. —_— ——
All desires (lusts) perish, from the inner sense of the striver,
"
1654,"Verse 3] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1599 /
who is dispassionate, from within. A devotee possessing strong
dispassion, having no affinity for the insentient objects, such as the
body, senses, mind and intellect etc., wishes everyone to be happy, _
free from disease and suffering and to attain benediction. :
'T' is the knower and the onlooker, while the entire universe,
including the gross, subtle and causal bodies, to be known and .
seen. 'I', is imperishable, while the universe and the body, are |
perishable. He who realizes this distinction, cuts off this tree of
creation, with a strong axe of non-attachment. When a man, does
. not attach importance to this discrimination, the tree of creation, |
seems to be firm-rooted. : .
Worldly objects cannot be totally destroyed, but attachment
to these can be totally, renounced. This detachment, is known
as cutting of this tree. -
The universe ceases, to be, when attachment to it, is -
renounced. Only a thing or person, we have no real affinity
for, can be renounced (cut off). A man (the self), is sentient and 7
imperishable, while the universe is insentient, and perishable.
So his affinity for the universe is unreal, it is assumed, by an ~
error. He, who is really detached, gets detached. We should
accept the fact, that we have no attachment for the universe.
Howsoever, firm-rooted the world may be, if we do not accept 7
our affinity for it, it is naturally cut off, because this affinity, ns
is merely assumed. So a striver, should doubtlessly believe,that
he has no affinity at all for the world, even though he may not
perceive it, in practical life.
A man, himself has accepted this affinity for the body, and
the world. So, it is his responsibility, to-cut it off. Therefore,
the Lord is exhorting us, to cut it off. |
Some Easy Means of Renouncing
(1) Render service to the world, with the material acquired
"
1655,"1600 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 15
from the world, without any selfish motive. - 7 :
Lo 7 (2) Renounce desire, for mundane pleasure and prosperity.
(3) Renounce dependence, on the world totally, = ©) ~
(4) Renounce a sense of 'T’ and ‘mine, with the body and
the world.
(5) Stick firmly to reality, ""I am God's; God is mine."" |
(6) Have a resolve, ""I have to realize God.""
(7) Perform your duty, sanctioned by the scriptures
scrupulously (Gita 18/45). | | | |
(8) Attach importance, to your own experience, that your -
body, circumstances, strength, ability etc., are not the same, as
they were, in your childhood, they have all changed, while you
are the same. _
(9) Do not accept your assumed affinity, for the world. .
Appendix—The Lord has declared about Himself—“TI am the -
beginning, the middle and also the end of the entire creation”
(Gita 10/20, 32) and here about the world He declares, “It has
neither its end nor origin nor existence.” It means that God exists .
in the beginning, in the middle and in the end of the creation
while the world has no existence either at the beginning or in the
middle or in the end viz., the world does not exist——‘nasato vidyate
bhavah’ (Gita 2/16). Therefore there is nothing else besides God. OO
‘AsangaSastrena drdhena chittva’—Here the term ‘chittva’
does not mean ‘to cut’ or ‘to destroy’ but it means ‘to be
detached’. The reason is that this world being God’s ‘apara
prakrti’ is imperishable. The Self is detached—‘asango’hyayam
purusah’ (Brhada. 4/3/15). The Self is free from attachment to
the modes. Attachment to the modes is the root of birth and
death—‘karanarh gune sango’sya sadasadyonyanmasw’ (Gita 13/21).
Therefore having realized the detached, untainted, undecaying
and immortal nature of the Self, getting established in it, is ‘to
cut off the world-tree’. |
"
1656,"Verse 4] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI - 1601 |
The world seems to exist owing to attachment. The thing, to
which a man is attached, seems to be existing and valuable. Without
attachment, the world may appear to exist but it is not of any _
value. Therefore the expression ‘asafgasastrena drdhena chittva’ |
means——to wipe out attachment to the world totally viz., not to be
attached to anyone else besides God and not to assume anything ;
of the entire creation as one’s own and for one’s own self. In fact
the existence of the world does not lead to bondage but attachment
to the world leads to bondage. Existence is not an obstacle but
attachment is the obstacle. Therefore other philosophers call the |
world real or unreal etc., but the Lord says that attachment to the
world should be renounced. Having given up attachment to the
world, the world in its seeming form disappears and it is revealed |
as the manifestation of God——*Vasudevah sarvam’. | -

Comment:— :
'Tatah padam tatparimargitavyam—In the preceding verse,
"
1657,"1602 - §RIMADBHAGAVADGITA _ [Chapter 15 |

the Lord talked of cutting off the tree of creation, while here, He

speaks of, seeking God. It proves, that it is inevitable to renounce

affinity, for the world, before seeking God. The reason is, that So

He pervades equally, every object, person, incident, circumstance |

etc., all the time, but when a person accepts his affinity for the

universe, he cannot realize Him. The spiritual practice of chanting,

and study of the scriptures etc., does not prove much fruitful,

because of his affinity for the world. So a striver, should attach,

first and foremost importance, to renouncement of affinity, for

the world. | |
The man (soul) (self), is a fragment of God, but he forgets -

his eternal affinity for Him, when he accepts his affinity for the

world in error. When this error is rectified, he gains recognition

(memory) of the reality, that he is God's. Therefore, the Lord _

declares, that he has had already his affinity for the supreme

goal (God), only He is to be sought for. — :
When a striver, accepts the world as his, the ever-attained -

Lord, seems to be unattained and the world which is never attained,

seems to be attained. Therefore, the Lord by using the term ‘Tat' -

(that), exhorts Arjuna, to seek Him, Who is ever attained. .
Only that is sought, which already exists. God is without —

beginning and He pervades, everywhere and so He is not to be :

sought after by applying, any particular means. But, it means

that a striver, instead of depending on the world (body, family

and wealth etc.,) which is never his, should depend on God,

Who is always, his, Who is in him and Who exists, even now.

In this way, a striver should seek Him. |
A striver, should perform spiritual practice, certainly, because

there is no activity superior to it. But he should not think that God

will be realized by spiritual practice, because by thinking so, he

will be proud and pride is a stumbling block, to God-realization.

He can be realized, by His grace, He cannot be bought, by any

means (spiritual practice). Spiritual practice, roots out evils of
"
1658,"Verse 4] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1603

attachment and desire, for the world, which are obstacles to, -

God-realization. These obstacles, have been created by the striver~ —

himself. Therefore, when a striver wants to root out these evils,

from his heart, by God's grace, they are rooted out. | ~
_ Generally strivers assumes that God can be realized (through

the purification of the mind), in the same way by making efforts,

as worldly objects, are acquired. But in fact, it is not so, because

even the most virtuous actions such as penance etc., are transitory,

and have a beginning and an end. So, how can the perishable

bear an imperishable fruit? Through penance and renunciation

etc., the assumed affinity, for Matter, (the world and the body), is

renounced. Having renounced this assumed affinity, ever-attained /

God, Who ever pervades everywhere is realized—memory for

him is aroused and recognition is gained.

Having listened to Lord's gospel, Arjuna says, Recognition 7
(memory) is gained’ (Gita 10/73). Though forgetfulness, is also
without beginning, yet it can come to an end. There is a vast _
difference,between the memory of the world and that of God.

Of the world's memory, forgetfulness is possible, as a person -
suffering from paralysis could forget the knowledge, acquired
earlier through study. But if God's memory, is once gained there

is never forgetfulness (Gita 2/72, 4/35).

Even while suffering from paralysis he never forgets his a

existence (I am), because he can never have his real affinity for
the world, and his real affinity for God, can never be renounced.
He who has realized the fact, that he has no affinity for the body
and the world, has in fact cut off this tree of creation; and he
who has realized the truth that he (the self), is a fragment of
God, has sought God. As soon as a striver renounces his affinity
for the world, he realizes (attains) God, Who is ever-attained.

""Yasmingata na nivartanti bhiyah—The term ‘Yasmin’, used
here stands for God, Who has been described in the first verse
by the expression 'Urdhvamiilam' (root above), and in this verse
"
1659,"1604 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 15
by the expression 'Adyarn purusam’' (Primal Person), and Who is
going to be described in more detail, in the sixth verse ahead.

As a drop of water, after merging in the ocean cannot be |
separated from it, so the soul (the self), a fragment of God, __
having attained God, cannot be separated from Him, i.e., from
His abode, there is no return. It is attachment to nature, or to

_its modes, which is the cause of a soul's birth in good and
evil wombs (Gita 13/21). Therefore, when a striver cuts off the
attachment to the modes, with a strong axe of non-attachment,
no question arises of his rebirth, anywhere. :

""Yatah pravrttih prasrta purani'—God is the creator of the :
entire universe (creation), and also its base and illuminator. A
man, out of delusion is attracted towards the world, created by
Him, because of its sensual pleasure and forgets the Creator. -
When the world, created by God, seems so charming and loving,
how much charming and loving, should He be? Though in the
world created by Him, attraction towards the world, is in fact -
attraction to Him, because it is a manifestation of His fragment
(Gita 10/41), yet, out of ignorance, a person assumes that there = -
is attraction because of the glory of the world, rather than that
of God, and so he gets entangled, in the world. -

Every being's, nature is that (it or) he depends upon the :
object or person etc., he considers it superior to all others and an
from which he expects to receive some pleasure or satisfaction.
Worldly people, hanker after wealth, because they think that
they can acquire all the necessities as well as luxuries of life,
and honour and praise etc., by money (wealth). So, they do not
hesitate to commit sins and doing injustice, while earning money.
They even do not give proper rest to their, bodies because they
remain engaged in earning money,which according to them is
superior, to all other attainments. Similarly, when a striver, comes
to know that God is the Supreme Being, and having realized
Him, one attains such a bliss, which is superior to all mundane |
"
1660,"Verse 4] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1605 |
pleasures, all sensual pleasures, become insipid before that bliss ;
(Gita 6/22) and then he starts worshipping Him, with all his
being (heart) (Gita 15/19). . :
'Tameva cadyari purusam prapadye'—A striver, should .
seek refuge in the Primal Person, Who is the source of all
beings (Gita 10/2). If he takes refuge, in other perishable
worldly, persons and objects, they will ruin him, in the same -
way as a_ crocodile devours a person who takes refuge, in it.
Therefore, he should take refuge, only in the imperishable Lord,
rather than, in the perishable world. :
When 8a striver, fails in getting rid of his defects, by applying .
all his power, he gets disappointed. In such circumstances, if he
seeks refuge only in God, by His grace he totally becomes free
from evils, and realizes Him. Therefore a striver, should never -
lose heart, as far as God-realization, is concerned. Having taken
refuge in Him, he should become free from all fears and worries,
because by doing so, by His grace all obstacles are overcome -
and God is realized (Gita 18/58,62). .
As a Striver, has to renounce his attachment for the world, so _
has he also to renounce attachment to non-attachment, because .
by being detached he may still have egoism in its subtle form,
by thinking ""I am detached."" But, when he takes refuge in Him, |
this subtle egoism can perish, easily. When he seeks refuge in a
Him, he surrenders his so-called body, senses, mind, intellect,
egoism ('I'ness), riches, property and family to Him i.e., he has
no feelings of possession, over them.
The devotee, who takes refuge in God, thinks ‘I am God's’ and |
‘1 am for Him’ and 'God is mine’ and ‘He is for me.’ Out of these
two thoughts, the former 'IT am God's and for Him’ is superior,
to the latter, because in the former thought, he has no desire of
his own, he remains satisfied and happy with God's will. So, he
desires, neither to do nor to acquire, anything for himself. In this
way, his undefinable and singular devotion to God, is aroused. .
"
1661,"1606 | SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 15

In devotion, there is limitless bliss and it provides bliss, even to

God, Who is the storehouse of bliss. In this devotion, meeting

with the Lord, does not satisfy a devotee, this devotion does

not decrease in separation, but it is enhanced, every moment. -
Devotion (love), which 1s attained after Self-realization, is also -
attained, through surrender (refuge)... _- : | -

The term 'Eva' means, total dependence on God, only, having :
renounced all other supports. The same idea, has been expressed
in. the Gita, in the expression., ""Those who take refuge in Me
alone"" (7/14), ""Seek refuge in Him alone"" (18/62) and ""Take
refuge in Me alone"" (18/66).

The term 'Prapadye’, means ‘I seek refuge.’ Here a doubt
‘may arise, whether the Lord, also seeks refuge and in whom He
seeks refuge? The clarification is, that the Lord does not seek /
refuge in anyone, because He is the Supreme Lord of the entire
creation. In order to set an example to the people He explains it
to a striver, by speaking in his language, that he should think, -
""I take refuge."" ,

'God is’ and 'I am’ in both these one divinity exists in the
form of ‘is’. When the self assumes Its affinity, for the body, |
senses, mind and intellect etc., there cannot be unswerving ~—
devotion, or total surrender, to God. .

But ‘is’ is changed into ""am' due to 'T’. If individuality of 'T ———_-— —
is merged into cosmos ‘is’ then only ‘is' will remain, there will
be no ‘am’. Being a fragment of God, the self always depends
on God, but by an error, It having a disinclination for God,
depends on the perishable world. So It has to suffer, because
of Its dependence on the perishable. Therefore a striver, having |
realized his true affinity, for God depends only on Him Le.,
seeks refuge only in Him.

Appendix—The world is perishing every moment, therefore
it is renounced—‘asangaSastrena drdhena chittva’, and God is
ever-attained, so He is to be sought for (discovered)—‘tatah |
"
1662,"Verse 4] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1607
padath tatparimargitavyam’. There is a difference between
‘production’ and ‘discovery’. The thing which does not exist,
is produced, while the thing, which already exists, is discovered. -
God is ever-attained and self-evident, so He is searched out, He BS
is not produced. When a striver accepts the existence of God, he |
discovers Him. There are two ways of discovery—the first one
is that as we forget a necklace by placing it somewhere and then :
we search it here and there; and the second is that the necklace
is worn round the neck but-we have the false notion that the
necklace is lost, we search it here and there. The discovery of :
God is like the discovery of the necklace worn round the neck. -
In fact God is not lost. But because of attachment to the world, /
we have not an eye on Him, so He appears to be lost to us. It
means that God, Whom we want to attain and Whom we seek,
is constantly present in us. So He is discovered on being sought. ~
But the world can never be gained, because it is not in us, as
actually it does not exist.

God has neither been unattained, nor is unattained, and His
unattainment is in fact impossible. He has not been unattained
but there has been forgetfulness. This forgetfulness is without. -
beginning but it comes to an and. As two persons are unfamiliar
with each other and the third persons asks them, “How long
have you been unfamiliar with each other?” No one can answer -
it. Similarly suppose we don’t know Sanskrita language, then re
how long has this ignorance of ours been? We can’t tell it. It
means that the existence of the persons, our existence and the
existence of Sanskrita language, have already been there, but their
familiarity is not there. Similarly at the time of forgetfulness also
the existence of God remains the same. God is ever-attained but
we are forgetful of Him, viz., we have no eye on Him, we have
disinclination for Him, we are unfamiliar with Him and we have
the wrong notion that He is unattained to us. On the discovery of
God, this forgetfulness is gone and He is attained. The method
to discover Him is to get detached from (renounce) that which |
"
1663,"1608 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 15 |
is non-existent—‘asangasastrena drdhena ‘chittva’. Renunciation
means to be disconnected with it and. to ‘reject it by assuming
that it has no existence, no value. Therefore. detachment from
the world implies the discovery of God. In Srimadbhagavata it |
_ 1s mentioned—“‘atattyajanto mrgayanti santah’ (10/14/28).
 ‘Tameva cadyath purusarn prapadye’—Having renounced ;
affinity with the world, a striver gets established in the Self and
he is liberated. Having attained liberation (salvation), the desire
for the world is wiped out but hunger for love is not satisfied. In |
Brahmasitra it is mentioned ‘muktopasrpyavyapadesat’ (1/3/2). |
‘That Lord, Who is an embodiment of love, 1s attainable even
for the liberated souls’. It means that the perfection of human
life lies in attaining the love for God Whose fragment the Self
is. In Self-realization, there is bliss of the Self, while in God -
there is Supreme Bliss (endless Bliss). He, who is not satisfied
with salvation, attains love (devotion) which enhances every
moment—‘madbhaktirh labhate param’ (Gita 18/54). Therefore -
the Lord has mentioned that a striver, having renounced attachment
to the world, viz., having attained salvation, and then having ~
sought God, should seek refuge in Him.

~ Comment:— - | | |

‘Nirmanamoha'—When a person, has a sense of ‘I’ and
‘mine’ in the body, he has a desire to win, honour (respect) etc.

He, by identifying the self, with a body, regards the honour of :
the body, as honour of the self, and he gets entangled. But
those deVotees, who regard only God, as theirs, have no sense
of egoism and possession in the body, and so they do not get
pleased, by honour (respect), of the body. Having taken refuge -
only in God, they are not attached to a body and so they have
no desire, for honour (respect). | -

Having only the aim of God-realization and by depending
on God only, those devotees, develop a disinclination, for the -
world. They become detached, from the world. So, they become
free from worldly delusion.

'Jitasangadosa'—Attraction towards God, is called devotion - |
(love), and attraction towards the world, is called attachment. It oo
is because of attachment, that evils such as a sense of possession,
desire, lust and hope etc., arise. It is by taking refuge in God,
that a striver gets victory over, all these evils.

A man, can be attached to both the objects acquired, as well
unacquired. But, there is desire, only for unacquired ones. So .
the expression ""Vinivrttakamah’ (desires completely stilled), has
been used separately. oe

the world. Thus, he constantly dwells in Him. As a person,
according to his birth, accepts that he is a Brahmana or Vaisya
and he always remains, assured of it, even without, remembering a -
it, so, do the devotees, who accept their affinity, for God, always :
dwell in Him. ) oF
'Vinivrttakamah'—A man, desires mundane objects and ;
favourable circumstances, only when he aims at mundane pleasure :
and prosperity. But those devotees, whose aim, is not to acquire
mundane objects, become totally free, from desires.

It is sense of mineness in the body, which gives birth to
desires. When a man is thus attached to a body, he wants it ”
to be healthy and strong. So is the case with, other mundane
objects and riches etc. As a devotee, is not attached to a body
and the world, all his desires are stilled. He thinks that his so- -
called body, senses, mind, intellect and egoism (‘I'ness), are only |
God's, and only God is his. The desires of such a devotee, are
totally silenced. | | :

-

In fact, this body is constantly decaying (perishing). A
striver, has to accept this reality, in a practical way. All desires
are born of having contact with perishable objects, such as body
etc. One day this process of decay, will be over, and then it BO
will be said, that the body has decayed (died). But actually,
the body has not died today. The process of constant decay has
completed today. Therefore, in order to be free from desires, a
striver should realize this fact, that mundane objects, such as
the body etc., are not, his, because these are transient while he
(the self) is permanent and eternal.
the illuminator of the entire creation yet they by an error assume that they
dwell in the world as “I belong to a particular caste or creed or sect etc.” It
is because of this contrary assumption (belief) that they are bound and are
born in good and evil wombs. :
"
1666,"Verse 5]. - -SADHAKA-SANFIVANT 1611

-» In fact, desires are never satisfied. When a desire seems
to be satisfied, another one appears, and so a person tries to |
satisfy that one. The more, they are satisfied, the more they -
arise. All persons and objects of the world cannot satisfy desires,
of even a single person, so if a person desires limited objects
of the world, in order to derive pleasure out of them, it is an
error on his part one who entertains desires, cannot attain peace .
(Gita 2/70). Therefore, renouncement of desires, is a means of
attaining, supreme peace. So a striver, should renounce desires,
instead of trying to satisfy them. |

The belief, that mundane objects, provide pleasure, gives

birth, to desire. The keener the desire, to acquire an object, the
greater the pleasure, a person derives out of that object. But, the |
fact is, that it is not the object which provides pleasure, as it is -
renouncement of attachment of that object, which gives pleasure.
This renouncement occurs, when he acquires, the object. If he
renounces the desire to acquire the object he cannot feel happy -
on getting the object or sad on not getting that object.

In fact, mundane objects have no independent. existence, -
as they are perishing all the time. So how the desire for such
transitory objects can remain lasting? Thus all strivers, can be
freed from desires. |

'Dvandvairvimuktah sukhaduhkhasafijiiaih'—Devotees are -
liberated from contrary experiences, known as pleasure and
pain, attachment and aversion, because according to them, all
the favourable and unfavourable circumstances, are regarded as
God's gift, presented to them, by Him. They have an eye on God's .
grace, rather than on desirable or undesirable circumstances. So
they are easily liberated from the pairs of opposites.

God is a disinterested friend, of all beings (Gita 5/29). So He -
never think, of evil of His fragment, the soul (self). Whatever,
He does, is only for the welfare, of beings. So devotees, ever
remain pleased, with His will. Though their senses, mind and
"
1667,"1612. SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 15 |
intellect, know of desirable and the undesirable circumstances,
yet they themselves, are free from the pairs of opposites.

This contrary experience (of attachment and aversion etc.,) is
the root of sins. In order, to renounce such experience a striver,
should not attach importance to perishable objects. This opposite.
feeling is of two kinds—- =. : :

(1) Gross (practical) contrary experience between pleasure
and pain, a agreeable and disagreeable etc. Beings, including | .
men, birds, beasts and even trees etc., desire the agreeable and -
have an aversion for the disagreeable. |

- (2) Subtle (Spiritual) opposite feelings. It is essential and
useful, to regard one's own way of adoration, and one's own _
favourite Deity, as supreme. But the sentiment in which a striver, |
honours and praises his method of worship, and his favourite
deity, regarding them as superior, to the worship and deity of -
others whom he discredits and blames, by considering them,
inferior, is harmful for a striver. -

In fact, all spiritual practices, aim at a total renouncement
of affinity, for the world. Spiritual practices (disciplines), may
differ according to tastes, faiths, beliefs and qualifications of .
each devotee but their aim is the same. So a striver, instead of To
having an eye on, the difference of spiritual practices, should
have an eye on the aim and be devoted to his spiritual practice.

By doing so his subtle opposite feeling comes to an end.

In the Gita, the gross is called 'Mohakalilam’ (mire of
delusion) (2/52) while subtle is called ‘Srutivipratipanna
(bewildered by the Vedic text)* (2/53). So long as a striver, is

* Srutivipratipanna means that the person remains in a dilemma and
cannot take the decision which of the paths as mentioned in the scriptures
of knowledge, of action, of devotion, of dualism, of non-dualism, of pure
non-dualism, of dualism-non-dualism, of action for reward or action without |
"
1668,"Verse 5} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI - 1613 . |
attached to the world or attaches importance, to the world, this | |
opposite experience exists. So it is necessary to root out this. |
So long as, there is delusion, contrary experiences exist?
He who perceives pair of opposites in the self is deluded. This _ |
contrary experience of attachment and aversion, pleasure and |
pain, happiness and sadness etc., abides in the mind rather-than |
in the self. The mind is insentient, while the self is sentient and
is an illuminator of the insentient. Therefore, the self has no | |
affinity for the mind, this affinity is merely assumed.
Everybody knows, that he remains the same, in the pairs of |
opposites, such as pleasure and pain etc. But out of delusion,
by identifying the self with these, he becomes happy and sad. If . |
he remains established in the self, whichever remains, the same
without assuming that the pairs of opposites (such as pleasure |
and pain) are in him, he will be liberated from the duality of -
pleasure and pain etc. | | |
The Lord, has pointed out an easy way, to be liberated |
from the dualities of attachment and aversion etc., by declaring -
""Attachment and aversion of man abide in sense objects through |
the feeling of pleasantness and unpleasantness; let, none come -
under their sway"" (Gita 3/34). It means, that a striver, should not |
- act by coming under their sway, because they are strengthened
by doing so. - |
_ ‘Gacchantyamidhah padamavyayam tat'—He, who desires Te
perishable objects; who makes efforts to acquire them, and feels |
happy or sad by acquiring them, or without acquiring them, is
deluded. In fact, the world is kaleidoscopic while God is eternal, |
and it is because of His existence that the world, seems to exist. |
He, who accepts the existence of the world, is deluded. | |
As a deluded person, perceives the world clearly, so does |
reward is better. Similarly he cannot decide which of the deities—Lord Visnu,
Lord Rama, Lord Krsna, Lord Siva, Lord GaneSa or Goddess Durga should |
be worshipped.

the existence of the world, is deluded, while he who accepts

it as kaleidoscopic, is undeluded. The undeluded one, is not. _
: _ affected by pleasure and pain, and he, who remains the same, |

in pleasure and pain 1s fit, for attaining Immortality (Gita 2/15).

Therefore, here in this verse, the Lord has laid emphasis two

times, on the renouncement of delusion, by using the expression

‘Nirmanamohah’, and also the term Amidhah'. :

Delusion can be of two kinds—(1) inclination to the world,
rather than to God, (2) not to know the reality about God. In
this verse, the expression 'Nirmanamohah' stands for, freedom -
from delusion of the world, while the term 'Amidhah™ stands
for true knowledge about God. ""

God, Who has been mentioned by the -. expression _
'Urdhvamillam' (root above), in the first verse, Who has been
called, the Supreme Goal, which should be sought in the fourth
verse, and Who has been glorified in the sixth verse, the same -
supreme abode has been called here, ‘Avyayam padam’ (the Eternal
Goal). Strivers who have become totally free from evils, such -
as honour, delusion and attachment etc., attain the Eternal Goal,
from where, there is no return. :

: In fact, Eternal Goal, is naturally ever-attained by every .
human being but a man does not realize this fact as he has turned To
his eye away from that Goal (God). This can be explained by
an illustration. When our train stops at a station, an other. train
suddenly starts moving, our eye being on the moving train we
feel as 1f our train has started moving. But we come to know the
reality, when we look out at the station. Similarly, when a person
is attached to the world, he finds himself moving (kaleidoscopic).

But, when he looks at the self, he realizes that he (the self), is

* As the devotee who knows attributeless God becomes undeluded (5/20)
so does the devotee who worships the Lord endowed with attributes and form
also becomes undeluded (10/3;15/19). |

Comment:— - |
[The sixth verse, is the link between the fifth verse and the |
seventh verse. In this verse the Lord declares, that the Eternal . |
Goal is His Abode, Which has identity with Him, in the same |
way as His fragment, the soul, has identity with Him. Therefore, |
the soul has also identity with that Abode (Eternal Goal), i.e., ;
the soul, has eternal union with that Abode. wee, |
Though this verse, is closely related with the twelfth verse, |
yet it has been introduced here to link the fifth and the seventh |
verses. In this verse the Lord makes two important points (1) The |
sun etc., cannot ilumine that Abode. The reason for it has been |
explained in the twelfth verse and (2) Those, who reach His |
abode do not return to the world (the cause has been explained
by the Lord in the seventh verse of this chapter.)] |

is a fragment of God, So long as, it does not atttain its source
God, it cannot be liberated, ‘from the cycle of birth and death.
It attains real and permanent peace, only when it attains God,, -
Whose fragment It is, in the same way, as water of a river gets ,
lost after merging in an ocean, whose fragment it is. In fact, the
self has its identity with God, but because of Its attachment
with matter (which is assumed), it has to take birth in good .
and evil wombs. | | _
Here the term ‘Paramadhama’, stands both for the abode of
God, as well as, for God. This Supreme Abode, 1s the embodiment
of light. As the sun in spite of remaining fixed, at its particular
position, pervades everywhere, in the form of light i.e., the sun
and its light are one and the same, so are the Supreme Abode
and all-pervading God, one and the same. -
According to the beliefs of devotees, the same Supreme Abode,
which is sentient, embodiment of knowledge, embodiment of |
light and embodiment of God, is known by different names, as =
Brahmaloka, Saketaloka, Goloka, Devidvipa, and Sivaloka etc.
This imperishable Supreme Goal, pervades everyone, in the -
form of the self. So, all of us, dwell in that Supreme Goal, but
we do not realize this fact, because of our identity with and
attachment and desire, for the matter (body etc.,). |
Appendix—We are fragments of God—‘mamaivaméo jivaloke’ Te
(Gita 15/7). Therefore the Lord’s Abode is also our abode. This
is the reason that having attained that Abode, there is no return
to this world. So long as we don’t attain that Abode, we like a
passenger, will go on wandering in several wombs and in several
worlds and will not be able to stay anywhere. Even if we reach
the Abode of Brahma, the highest plane of existence, we have to
return—‘“abrahmabhuvanallokah punaravartino’rjuna’ (Gita 8/16).
The reason is that the entire universe is a foreign land, not our own
land; it is the abode of others, not ours. Our roaming and going
astray will come to an end only, when we reach our Real Abode. |
"
1672,"1618 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 15

Having attained the Lord’s Supreme Goal (Abode), there is
no return—this has been mentioned in the Gita in the following
three verses— a Ce -

1. Yarh prapya na nivartante taddhama paramarh mama (8/21). :

2. Tatah padam tatparimargitavyarn yasmingata na nivartanti
bhiiyah (15/4). oO | | | :

3. Yadgatva na nivartante taddhama paramarh mama (15/6).

The Lord in the path of knowledge has declared the
state from which there is no return—‘ gacchantyapunaravrttith :
jihananirdhutakalmasah’ (Gita 5/17), but in the path of devotion _
there is attainment of God’s Supreme Abode—this is the speciality
of devotion. In the Abode of God, love is specially relished.

The Supreme Goal can neither be illumined by ‘adhibhautika
light’ (sun, moon etc.,) nor by ‘adhidaivika light’ (eye, mind,
intellect and speech etc.,). The reason is that it is Self-effulgent. In
it there is no distinction between the illuminator and the illumined. Oe

_ In ‘gatva’ there is ‘gati’, not ‘pravrtti’ because the fragment
naturally moves towards the whole, in it there is no ‘pravrtti’. -
‘Pravrtti’ is intentionally done while ‘gati’ is spontaneous :
and automatic. -

‘Gati’ (motion) and ‘pravrtti’ (activity)—‘Gati’ is natural -
which involves no labour, no effort and no doership. But ‘pravrtti’ re
is unnatural, needs labour and effort and involves doership. There
is ‘pravrtti’, when the person has the egoistic notion but there is
‘gati’, when there is no egoism. Therefore ‘gati’ is towards the
Self, while ‘pravrtti’ is towards the non-Self. ‘Gati’ is towards God, ,
while “pravrtti’ is towards the world. ‘Gatti’ is towards the sentience
while “pravrtti’ is towards the insentience. ‘Gati’ leads towards the
limitless while ‘pravrtti’ leads towards the limited. ‘Gati’ paves the

' way to independence while ‘pravrtti’ paves the way to dependence.
When a man hankers after pleasures and prosperity, there is
‘pravrtti’ and when he provides comfort to others, there is ‘gati’. :
"
1673,"Verse 7] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1619 |
The origin of ‘gati’ is ‘the real’. while the origin of ‘pravrtti’
is ‘the unreal’. As the origin of the Ganges is Gangotri, if by
keeping back the water of the Ganges, a dam is built which is
of a greater height than the height of Gangotri, then naturally the =
water of the Ganges will flow back to its origin, Gangotri. Thus
the flow of the Ganges towards its origin is “gati’. Therefore
there is ‘gati’ in two ways—to have a disinclination for the .
world (pleasures and prosperity) and to have an inclination to
God Who is to be attained. If the assumption of the unattainment
of the ever-attained Lord is wiped out, it is also ‘gati’ (motion)
towards God. In ‘gati’ the assumed distance from God comes
to an end and the real unity with God 1s revealed.
If a striver feels that his feelings and conduct are better
than they were several years ago, this is a striver’s ‘gati’. In -
the ‘gati’, during the course of spiritual practice, there may be
a subtle ego; but having attained salvation, the ‘gati’ that is
there towards the ever-increasing love, is totally free from the -
subtle ego. The reason is that the more disinclination a man
has for God, the more egoistic, he becomes. Even by getting -
established in the Self, the subtle ego may linger which is not
an obstacle to salvation but it causes differences of opinions |
among philosophers. By becoming ‘abhinna’ (inseparable) or |
one with God, the ego is totally effaced. a

- mamaivamso jivaloke § jivabhitah sanatanah
manahsasthanindriyani prakrtisthani karsati

An eternal fragment of My own self having become an —
embodied soul, in the world of life, draws to itself the (five) senses
with the mind for the sixth, which are abiding in nature. 7
Comment:—_ :

‘Mamaivarnéo jivaloke jivabhitah sanatanah'—The term, 'Loka’
stands for Nature and its evolutes, which have no identity with
the soul (self). The term 'Jivaloke'’, stands for all the bodies, in the |
three worlds and the entire universe, which the soul, acquires.

The soul, is a fragment of God, but having assumed Its -
affinity for a body, senses, mind and life-breath etc., which are the
evolutes of Nature, It has become an embodied-soul—Jivabhitah'’, *
which is artificial, not real, like an actor in a play. -

' The Lord in the seventh chapter declared, ""This world is
sustained by My higher Nature, which is the soul"" (7/5) Le.,
though the soul, has no real affinity for the lower Nature (world), -
yet It has assumed its affinity, for it.

As the soul is a fragment of God,.so He always thinks of Its 7
welfare. As a lion-cub having joined a flock of sheep, considers
that he is a sheep and not a lion-cub, though even by mixing
with them, he is not converted into a sheep, so does the soul, >
identifying Itself with the body etc., forget Its real identity. As TO
a lion, makes the lion-cub aware of his identity by showing
him that he is the same, in shape, nature and roar etc., as the
former, so does the Lord, make the man (soul) aware, that he
is His fragment, having no affinity for Nature. He had neither |
any affinity with Nature, in the past, nor will have in future,
nor can he have it any time.

Out of all the means (disciplines) of God-realization, the
means of changing ‘egoism' (‘I' ness) and ‘sense of mineness'
is, easy and good. A striver's egoism and sense of mineness
determine his feelings and actions. A striver should believe that
"
1675,"Verse 7] - SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1621

he is only God's and only God, is his. :
Everyone knows that a person, acts according to his assumption

of particular caste, creed and order of life. But this assumption, -

that he is a Brahmana or an ascetic, is a temporary phase of |

life, in order to perform his duty, like an actor in a play. But a |

man (soul), is a fragment of God—this is a permanent reality.

He regards, the mind, senses, intellect, body, riches and property

as his own, by an error, but they never regard him, as theirs

while God, the creator of the entire universe declares, that the

soul is His fragment. :
What a blunder, we commit when we regard the objects, .

such as the body etc., as ours! Can we change them, as we :

desire? Can we possess them as long as we desire? Can we

maintain them, and carry them with us? | -
My mind, intellect, senses and body, are different today,

from what they were in childhood, while I am the same, without

undergoing any change. He, who perceives changes, himself -

remains changeless. Worldly objects and persons, are not my

lasting companions. I am an onlooker of the changing scene.
When a striver holds 'I am God's’, it means that he is

absorbed in God. A striver, commits an error, that he instead

of getting the self absorbed in God, tries, to engage his mind and .

intellect, in Him. So, he finds it difficult to control his mind, and - _

it takes a lot of time. So long as, a striver having forgotten the

fact 'I am God's assumes 'I am a Brahmana or an ascetic’, and

tries to engage his mind and intellect in God, he will not be so

much successful, as he can be when he accepts the fact that ‘T

am God's.’ Therefore, when the Lord in the fourth verse of this

chapter, exhorts Arjuna to seek refuge in Him, He means to say,

that the self should be, engaged in Him. Gosvami Tulasidasa

also declares, “If a person by becoming God's, follows spiritual |

practice, such as name chanting etc., his spoiled life of innumerable |

births, can be improved, today and even now"" (Dohavali 22),
"
1676,"1622 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 15
It means that if a striver, himself gets absorbed in Him, his |
mind and intellect get easily absorbed in Him. As Meghanada,
while declaring that he is the son of Ravana in a play, and also
performing his part scrupulously, from within does not believe that -
he is MeghanAda, so should a striver, while performing his duties |
on the stage of this world, think that he is God's, not of the world.
An embodied soul, has been of God since time immemorial. |
God has never abandoned it, nor has had a disinclination for it.
The soul can also not renounce Him, but in having misused Its
freedom it has developed a disinclination for God, by an error. ,
As ornaments made of gold cannot be separate from gold, so
. can, the embodied soul never be separate from God...
A so-called, wise man commits a blunder, that he has a
disinclination for God, Whose fragment he is. He does not pay
attention to the fact, that God being a disinterested friend of all -
beings, is very benevolent and noble and His benevolence and
love, is beyond description. So it is an utter folly on his part, to _
regard perishable objects, as his, sacrificing the all-benevolent,
and all-merciful Lord. | -
‘When a man performs his duty, by obeying Him, He liberates
him from the bondage of birth and death, forever. But, if he
however by error performs forbidden actions, He warns him |
through sufferings that he is suffering, because of his past evil | .
actions and so he should not perform forbidden actions, again.
Moreover, He purifies him of his past sins, by forcing him to
reap the fruit of his past actions and prevent him from committing
new sins. . |
: God, regards a man (the soul) as His fragment, whether he is |
in hell or in heaven, in human-womb (life), or in animal-womb.
How benevolent, generous and great He sees the downfall of
men, and feels sad, He declares, that being qualified and deserving
to attain Him, they do not attain Him, but go down to the lowest
state (Gita 16/20). |
"
1677,"Verse 7] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 1623

God attracts him towards Him, in all circumstances, by
creating pleasant and unpleasant, favourable and unfavourable
circumstances. So a striver, should ever remain pleased and |
satisfied by thinking of His grace, because it is He, Who does :
not let him remain, in the same condition forever, otherwise
he may forget Him.

It is not at all difficult, fora man (the self), being a fragment |
of God, to realize Him. It is because of his disinclination for |
Him, and inclination for mundane objects, such as a body etc.,
that he feels it difficult, to attain Him quickly. He is already
attained. As soon as, a striver, has an inclination towards Him
by having a disinclination for the world, he realizes Him. It is 7
not an adventure on his part, to acquire mundane riches and
property etc., because all of these are perishable. But it is an
achievement to realize God, Who is imperishable and eternal. -

The more importance a man, attaches to perishable objects,
the more, fall he has, but the more importance he attaches to the -
imperishable Lord, the higher he rises, because he is a fragment
of God. | | 7

A man, can never attain greatness by acquiring perishable
mundane materials, though by a perverted outlook he may think

. so. But in fact, by thinking so, he is deprived of real greatness |
(God-realization). The greatness attained by acquiring mundane - |
materials, is unreal and transient, while the greatness attained
by God-realization, is real and eternal. Even gods honour, such
a God-realized soul, and desire his arrival in their abode. Not
only this, but even God becomes his subservient.

""Manahsasthanindriyani prakrtisthani karsati'—The soul,
being a fragment of God abides in Him, while senses and mind;
being a fragment of prakrti (nature), ever abide in it. But the
self, regards the mind and senses, as Its own, and it thus attracts
the mind and senses. | oe

Here the term ‘Mana’, stands both for the mind and the
"
1678,"1624 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 15
intellect. Similarly, the five organs of action and five life-
breaths, should also be included, in the five senses. The Lord
declares, that the soul being His fragment and abiding in _
Him, by an error, regards It as abiding in body, mind and |
senses, and forgets. its real abode. But actually, It can never
be separate from Him. | |
The Lord, mentions the five senses and the mind, in order |
to point out the fact, that a man (the soul) by being attached to
senses and mind, is bound. Therefore a striver, should surrender the |
body, senses, mind and intellect to the world, by rendering service
with these to the world, and surrender himself to God. :
(1) A man feels unhappy, because by an error he regards his _
body, family, property, honour and praise, as his and for him.
Moreover, it is very mean of him, that he regards himself as
great, because of prosperity and pleasure, while he becomes a ~
slave to them. In fact, the objects, which we regard as necessities
of life, and to which we attach importance, become superior to -
us, whether we know or we do not know that fact.
But if a person becomes a slave to God, God becomes
his slave. and makes him a jewel of His. crown. But mundane -
objects, never make anyone a jewel of their crown, even when Te
he becomes a very devoted slave, to them. In fact he becomes -
great, by taking refuge in Him. About such a devotee, the Lord
declares, ""O twice-born, I am not independent, I depend on My
devotees. They are very loving to Me, they have a full right
over My heart"" (Srimadbha. 9/4/63). Can mundane persons and
objects, attach so much of importance, to us? Never. |
This man (soul), in spite of being a fragment of God, being
attached to prakrti (nature) has a downfall. If he does not become
a slave, to mundane objects, such as body, senses and mind etc.,
he becomes beloved of Him (Gita 18/64). The Lord, calls those
"
1679,"|
Verse 7] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1625 -
devotees who have attained Him, dear to Him (Gita 12/13—19) |
while He calls strivers, who have not attained Him, but want to |
attain Him, exceedingly dear to Him (Gita 12/20). How much |
stupidity it is of man who does not regard the most benevolent |
Lord, Who calls strivers exceedingly dear, and enlightened souls, -
only dear, as his! |
(2) The body, is a fragment of the world, while the self (soul) |
is a fragment of God. A striver, commits an error, that he in |
spite of being a fragment of God, gets attached to the world, |
and wants the world as well as, God to be favourable to him. He |
should rectify this error. It can be rectified by moulding himself, |
according to God. It means, that he should leave the body at the |
will of the world, and leave the self at the will of God. : |
Offering a gift of the world to the world, and offering the |
gift of God to God, is honesty. This honesty, is called salvation |
or emancipation. But if the gifts presented by the world and God, - |
are not given back to them, it 1s dishonesty. This dishonesty is |
called bondage. |
Having offered the gift of the world to the world and : |
having offered the gift of God to Him, he should be free
from all worries. He should be a slave to His will, having no ~ |
: desire of his own, either to live or to die or to have favourable |
circumstances. Having surrendered himself to God, he should |
pray to Him, to enable him not to forget Him, in whatever |
circumstance he is placed by Him—on the earth, or in heaven ~ | |
or in hell; in childhood, in youth or in old age; honoured or |
dishonoured; happy or sad. |
A man is worried only about his limited property, riches and : |
the family which he regards as his own, but he is not worried about |
a lot of property, riches and millions of families which he does
not regard as his own. Thus, he is liberated or emancipated from |
most of them. Only a little bondage is there. If he ceases to regard |
the limited as his own, he will be emancipated, from these also.

_ We should give a serious thought to the topic that a few
persons and a little property which we regard as our own are
sure to vanish but if we do not discard our supposed relationship
with them, they will lead us to bondage, of birth and death. |
Therefore, a striver, should surrender his body and objects to the
world—which is a path of selfless action: or he should distinguish
the self, from the world including the body—this is a path of

| knowledge; or he should surrender himself to God—this is the
path of devotion. A striver, may follow anyone of the three
paths—each will bear the same fruit. |

Appendix—Here the Lord has mentioned that the soul is His :
fragment; the same soul in the fifth verse of the seventh chapter
has been said to be His ‘para prakrti’ (higher Nature) (Gita 7/5).
Therefore in both the cases the term ‘Jivabhuta’ (embodied -
soul) has been used—‘jivabhutah’, ‘jivabhutam’. ‘Para’ and |
‘Apara’—both are God’s powers (Gita 7/4-5). Since ‘para’ instead
of having an inclination to God, started having an inclination 7
towards ‘apara’, it (para) started following the cycle of birth and
death. This fact has been mentioned by the expression ‘yayedarh -
dharyate jagat’ in the seventh chapter and by the expression
‘manahsasthanindriyani prakrtisthani karsati’ here.

Though ‘apara’ is also God’s, yet its nature is different
(kaleidoscopic). Therefore the Lord declares, that he transcends -
the ‘apara’—‘yasmatksaramatito”ham’ (Gita 15/18). But ‘para’
and God are of the same nature (immutable). Therefore by the
term ‘eva’ in the expression ‘mamaivamsah’ the Lord means
to say that the soul is only His (God’s) fragment, in it there is
not the least trace of ‘prakrti’. As the body is the fragment of
both mother and father, the Self is not the fragment of God and
‘prakrti’, but it ts only God’s fragment. Therefore the Self has
affinity only with God, not with ‘prakrti’. But it itself gets attached
to ‘prakrti’—‘manahsasthanindriyani prakrtisthani karsati’.

‘Apara Prakrti’ belongs to God but the man (the soul) assumed
"
1681,"Verse 7] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI | 1627 |
it as his own and began to derive pleasure out of it, so he is
bound. As the things don’t belong to him (the Self), so they
don’t stay with him nor does the pleasure stay with him. —

A man assumes his affinity with the gross, the subtle and
the causal bodies, which is the root of all calamities. The Self
attracts the body towards itself viz., assumes the body as its own
but does not accept God as its own Who is really its own. This
is the main error committed by it (the Self). _

The Self is not a fragment of Brahma (attributeless) but —

is a fragment of God (endowed with attributes)—‘Isvara arhsa ,
jiva abinasi’ (Manasa 7/117/1). The reason is that Brahma is :
merely Pure Consciousness. Therefore in Brahma there can’t be

a fragment and the whole. The Soul is identical with Brahma

viz., the entity, which is the soul in diverse forms, is Brahma ~
in one form. If the Self is attached to the body, it is embodied )
Soul (Siva), and if it is not attached to the body, it is Brahma. -
Therefore in fact both Jiva and Brahma are fragments of the

entire form of God. So the Lord has declared that He is the

base of Braima—‘brahmano hi pratisthdham’ (14/27) and also
declared that Brahma is a fragment of His entire form—‘te

brahma tadviduh..........” (7/29-30).

, The mind and senses are the fragments of ‘prakrti’ and so |
they abide in ‘prakrti’—‘prakrtisthani’. Therefore a man (the Oe
Self) should learn this lesson that he should have his affinity
with the Entity Whose fragment he is. He himself will have to |
form this connection with God, no one else will form it. The
reason is that he himself has accepted the connection with the :
world and he himself is disinclined to God. The world is not
responsible for his inclination (attachment) to the world and
God is not responsible for his disinclination for Him but in
both cases, the Self is responsible. The Self being the fragment
of God, is independent but it has misused this independence.
Therefore the Self will have to make the proper use of this
"
1682,"1628 _ SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 15
independence—‘uddharedatmanatmanam’ (Gita 6/5). |
The affinity of the mind and senses with ‘prakrti’ is
eternal and real but their affinity with the Self is transient and - |
assumed. Transient affinity never remains permanent but it goes |
on changing and perishing. But the relationship of the Self with
God is immutable and imperishable. But having accepted the
transient affinity, the Self develops a disinclination for God, |
which he does not realize. . | :
_ ‘Mamaivarhgo jivaloke’—This expression reveals the feeling
that we assume God as ours but God knows us as His own. When
a man (the Self) takes refuge in God, then he also comes to .
know that the Lord is his—‘mameva ye prapadyante mayametarm
taranti te’ (Gita 7/14). |
A man (the Self) is an eternal fragment of God; therefore -
his real valour consists in accepting his affinity with God viz.,
in assuming God as his own. In physical valour an action is
important which is performed only for the world because the OB
- body is a fragment of the world. But in the valour of the Self, the
feeling is important. Therefore freedom from evils, detachment, -
and the sense of mine with God—these are valorous feelings of
the Self. By being free from evils, a man becomes useful for
the world. By being detached from the body and the. world, he .
becomes useful for himself. If he assumes God as his own, he nl
proves useful for God. Without being free from evils, a man can’t
be useful for the world. Without being detached from the body
and the world, a man can’t be useful for himself. Without having
the sense of mine with God, a man can’t be useful for God. .
_I should be free from evils, I should be detached, I should
be a lover of God—the realization of such necessity is a man’s
valour. But first of all a striver should accept that he can be free
from evils, he can be detached: and he can be a.lover of God.
For that a striver should know that from the view-point of the
world all beings are one, from the view-point of the soul also
"
1683,"Verse 7] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1629

all are one and from the view-point of the Lord also all are one. |

Therefore as we have the feeling for the welfare of our body,

similarly we should have. the feeling to promote the welfare of _

all bodies; or as we remain untainted and unconcerned with other 7

bodies, so should we remain unconcerned with this body also.

If we assume the identity of this body with all other bodies,

we can be free from evils. Having renounced attachment to all 7

bodies including our body, we can be detached (established in

the Self). Having renounced attachment to all bodies as well as

to the world, we can be the lovers of God. |
Being fragments of God, we have our affinity with -

God—‘mamaivamso jivaloke’, therefore we abide in God. But

the body, senses, mind and intellect have their affinity with

‘prakrti’, so they abide in ‘prakrti’——‘prakrtisthani’, ‘vikararhsca -

gunamscaiva viddhi prakrtisambhavan’ (Gita 13/19). There has

neither been, nor is, nor will be, nor can be our union with the

body; while we have neither been, nor are, nor will be nor can -

be separate from God. If anything is at the farthest from us, it is

the body; and if anyone is nearest to us, it is God. But because 7

of desire—the sense of mine—identification, we see things in |

a perverted way viz., the body appears near while God appears

far away, the body seems to be attained while God seems to

be unattained. a
In order to renounce the assumed affinity with the body,

a striver should accept three facts—1. The body is not mine

because it is beyond my control. 2. I need nothing. 3. I have to

do nothing for myself. So long as a striver assumes his affinity

with the three bodies—the gross, the subtle and the causal, the

actions performed with the gross body, reflection done with the

subtle body and trance attained with the causal body—ail the

three bind him. But when he renounces affinity with the three

bodies, then actions, reflection and trance don’t bind him viz.,

he becomes detached from them. |
"
1684,"1630 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 15 =
In order to arouse (realize) his eternal affinity with God,-a
striver should accept three facts—1. God is mine, 2. Iam God’s,
3. All is God’s. When his eternal affinity with God is aroused, -
a striver attains love (devotion) to God. Attainment of devotion ,
to God is the acme (or accomplished state) of human life.
A man has three desires—desire for pleasures, eagerness
for enlightenment: (Self-realization) and a yearning for love.
The desire for pleasure is related with the body, eagerness for
enlightenment is related with the Self and the yearning for love
is related with God. It is an error to assume the body as one’s |
own because the body ts a fragment of ‘prakrti’. Therefore :
desire for pleasure is not of the Self; but the assumption that it
is of the Self, is an error. But eagerness for enlightenment and
yearning for love, are one’s own, there is no error in it. Therefore -
by applying the body in the service of the family, the society
and the world in a disinterested manner, or by intensifying the -
eagermess for enlightenment, this error is rectified. With the
rectification of this error, the desire for pleasure is wiped out.
With the destruction of the desire for pleasure, the eagerness for .
enlightenment is satisfied and the striver realizes the Self viz.,
he attains enlightenment and he becomes a liberated soul. Then
in a man (the Self) who is a fragment of God, the yearning =
to love God is intensified. All beings are fragments of God,
therefore their final aim is to love God. Yearning for love is the
universal yearning. Having attained love; human life becomes
perfect and then nothing remains to be done, to be known and
to be attained. | : | Oe

As the wind wafts scent from its base, so does the Jivatma |
(embodied soul), assuming itself as the lord of body etc., take the
senses along with the mind from the body, which it leaves behind,
and migrate to the body, which it acquires. 8
Comment:— | | :

'Vayurgandhanivasayat'—Just as, the wind carries away :
scent (perfume) from a perfume box, but this perfume does not |
stay permanently in the wind, because the wind has no eternal
affinity for the scent. So does the individual soul, carrying the -
senses,. mind, intellect and natural instincts etc., (subtle and
causal—both bodies) by assuming them as Its own, migrate to
the body, which It acquires. -

_ As essentially the wind is unconnected with the smell (scent),
so is the soul unconnected with the mind, senses and body etc., -
but, by assuming these as Its own, attracts them towards it.

As wind in spite of being an evolute of ether, carries smell
(perfume) a fragment of the earth, so does the soul in spite
of being a fragment of God, carrying the transitory body, an Te
evolute of Nature, migrate to different wombs.The wind being
matter (insentient); does not possess discrimination, that it
should not take scent from its base. But an embodied soul has _
the discrimination and power, to renounce affinity for the body. |
Every human being, has been bestowed independence, by which
he can either get attached to an insentient body etc., or renounce
this attachment. In order to, rectify the error, he should accept
the reality, by changing the assumption, that he (the soul) has
no affinity for the physical, the subtle and the causal bodies, as
fragment of Nature. Then, he can be easily liberated, from the |
"
1686,"1632 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 15
bondage of birth and deathh =i So

In this illustration the Lord has used three words—(1) Wind
(2) Scent (perfume) (3) Seat. Here, the seat stands for physical _
body. As wind carries scent from a perfume box and the box is |
left behind, so does the soul carry the subtle and causal bodies,
while the physical body is left behind. — So

'Sariramn yadavapnoti yaccapyutkramatisvarah grhitvaitani
sarhyati'—Here the term ‘Isvarah', stands for the embodied
soul. This soul, commits three errors—(1) It regards Itself as the
master of mind, intellect and body etc., but actually, becomes
their slave. (2) It having become the master of insentient . .
objects, forgets Its real master, God. (3) It does not renounce |
Its assumed affinity for the insentient objects, though It is free
in renouncing them. a | -

God has given. independence to the embodied soul, to make
proper use of objects, such as a body etc., in order to, attain
salvation, rather than to become their master. But by an error, It -
instead of properly utilizing these, regards Itself as their master
and really becomes their slave.

It can renounce this assumed affinity, only when it comes
to know, that It has become a slave, to mundane objects, such
as body etc., whose master, It regards Itself. By doing so, he
(the soul) feels a shortage of mundane objects and feels itself - oe
as an orphan. |

One who is fond of becoming a master, cannot attain God,
because he forgets the real master. A child in childhood cannot
live without his mother, but when it grows into a youth and
as a householder, becomes a master of his sons and wife etc.,
he forgets his mother; so does the soul forget Its real master,
when It becomes the master of insentient objects, such as the
body etc. So long as, this forgetfulness continues i.e., It has a
disinclination for God, and It will go on suffering.

The term 'Api',with the term 'ISvarah’, has been used to denote,
"
1687,"Verse 8] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1633 |
that this lord i.e., the individual soul-is not powerless, insentient |
and dependent, like wind. It has capability and discrimination, to
renounce the assumed affinity for the world and realize Its true -
affinity for God. But, it is because of Its yearning for sensual |
pleasures, that it neither renounces nor does It want to renounce,
Its assumed affinity for the world. As soon as, It renounces this
affinity, it cannot carry bodies (like the scent) with It 1e., he |
becomes free from birth and death. | |
A man (soul), has got two kinds of power (i) Life-breath
power (ii) Power of desire. The life-breath power, decays every
moment and when it comes to an end, that is called death. _
Attachment to the insentient, leads a man, to have desire to act
and to acquire. If this desire to act and to acquire is wiped out,
while possessing life-breath power, a man is emancipated. But, -
if he gives up the body while possessing desire, he has to be
reborn. On account of desires of the previous birth, he receives
new life-breath to fulfil them. a -
The life-breath power, should be spent in removing desires.
Desire can be easily wiped out by being engrossed in the welfare 7
of all beings, without any selfish motive. |
The term 'Grhitva’ means to make attachment and accept
them as mine which are not ours. It takes them with It by |
regarding them as Its, while these never regard It, as theirs nor —- = /
are they controlled by It. This error of attachment and assumed
affinity binds It.
Whether a thing is acquired or not, whether it is superior or
inferior, whether it is being used by us or not, whether it is far
or near, if we regard it as ours, our attachment to it, subsists.
A man (the self), remains attached to mundane objects, such
as a body etc., even after giving up the body. Therefore, the
bones of a dead body are immersed into the Ganges, so that
the man (self or soul) may attain salvation. We are free and
powerful enough, to renounce this assumed affinity (attachment). ,
"
1688,"1634 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 15
If we renounce it during this life, we may attain salvation in |
this very life. : | -

This inclination towards, mundane objects which are not ours -
and disinclination for God, Who is ours, are great stumbling .
blocks in spiritual progress. a

The term ‘Etani’, stands for the mind and the five
senses, referred to in the seventh verse. Here it denotes mind, |
intellect, five senses, five organs of action and five life-breaths—
the aggregate of seventeen elements of the subtle body, as well as |
the causal body. The embodied soul, taking all of these migrates
to the body, which it acquires. Just as a person, casts off worn-out -
clothes and puts on new ones, so does an embodied soul, cast
off worn-out bodies and enter others, which are new (Gita 2/22).

In fact, it is not possible for the pure sentient soul, to -
renounce a body and to migrate to another body, because It is
immobile and pervading everywhere (Gita 2/17,24). But when
It identifies Itself with a body, an evolute of Nature i.e., It is -
seated in Nature, It gives up, one body and acquires, another
body. When the soul ceases to identify Itself with the bodies, -
(physical, subtle and causal), It is not reborn, because assumed
identification with a body, becomes the cause of Its birth in
good and evil wombs... : . :

Appendix—In the preceding verse the term ‘Karsati’ has SO
been used while in this verse the term ‘grhitva’ has been used.
‘Karsati’ means ‘to attract’ and ‘grhitva’ means ‘to catch’ viz.,

‘to identify’. The purpose of the Lord in giving the illustration
of the wind is that the Soul, like the wind, remains untainted. In
spite of dwelling in the body, in fact the Self’s untaintedness never
suffers—‘Sarirastho’ pi kaunteya na karoti na lipyate’ (Gita 13/31).
Perfume does not stay permanently in the wind, it disappears
automatically; but attachment to the mind, intellect and senses is
not renounced, unless the individual Self renounces it. The reason
is that the Self itself has caught them viz., has been attached to
"
1689,"Verse 8] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1635
them—‘grhitvaitani’; therefore he will be detached from them /
only, when he renounces attachment to them.
There 1s a natural distaste for every sensual pleasures—this
is everyone’s experience. Inclination to pleasures is. unnatural -
but disinclination is natural. A man (the Self) develops taste,
but distaste is natural. As a smoker while smoking a cigarette,
breathes in the smoke but it breathes out naturally. If the mouth
is shut, it is breathed out through the nose. This smoke does not |
stay, but he forms the bad habit of smoking and gets addicted
to it. Similarly pleasures don’t stay but the pleasure-seeker gets |
into the bad habit of enjoying pleasures. Objects of pleasures |
disappear naturally and there is natural disinclination for them
but because of bad habit, he gets attached to the pleasures
and actually being independent, he feels that he is dependent
upon them. In spite of being engrossed in pleasures, in fact _
his untaintedness is not wiped out but he does not take any
heed of it and doesn’t attach importance to it. He in spite of
having no affinity with the body, having assumed affinity with -
it, derives pleasure from it. Affinity is transient while disunion
is eternal. The body being of the class of the world (inert and -
kaleidoscopic), 1s different from the category of the Self. It is
not possible to have relationship with the thing which is alien.
Being a fragment of God, the soul and God are of the same
nature. Therefore he (the Soul) has his natural affinity with God. - - -
If a person (the Self) by having faith in utterances of Saints,
God and the scriptures, accepts his affinity with God, he will
realize his natural affinity with God. But he attaches importance
to objects. Unless he accepts his affinity with God, God does
not let him have his affinity with any other thing but breaks it 7
off. A man in spite of applying his full force, can’t maintain his
relationship with the world permanently.

Comment:—
‘Adhisthaya manaScayam’—Several (good or bad) projections

and distractions, appear and disappear in the mind, while the self —-

(sentient soul) ever remains unaffected. Being transcendental in

nature it is quite apart from it the insentient body, senses, mind

and intellect and it is their base and illuminator. -
The self joining with the mind, experiences (enjoys) the

objects of the senses, such as form (colour), touch, sound, taste

and smell. It cannot experience pleasure or pain with the senses, __

without mind. It is only through the mind, that the embodied

soul, enjoys sense-objects. -
'Srotram caksuh sparsanari ca rasanath ghranameva ca'—
Ear, the sense of hearing has the power of hearing.* Till
* The thoughts that come to the mind are projections and distractions. ~

During sleep, these appear as dream. We do not express every thought, nor do

we act according to this thought, because we apply our own intellect. Expression

of every thought, and translating it into practiceis nothing but insanity. Thus

projections, distractions, dream and insanity, are one and the same.

Through ears we get two kinds of knowledge (i) of sound (ii) of -
subject. So, the sense of hearing plays an important role in both the paths

of knowledge and of devotion, though through the sense of seeing (eye)

also the subject can be known by studying the scriptures, but that is also

the power of sound, in written form. When we start studying, first we

gain knowledge through hearing. The sound has such power which cannot

be thought of. The sense of hearing, only can receive, that power not the

other senses.
"

today, we have heard words favourable (praise, honour, o
blessing, melody, music etc.,) and unfavourable (blame,
dishonour, curse, abuse etc.,) but have they affected the self in

A person, hears happy news of the birth of his grandson
and sad news of the death of his son, at the same time. Thus
he has knowledge of two news. But, is there any difference in
that knowledge, or in the self?
We have seen many pleasant and unpleasant (horrible)

saltish food, but have these left any effect, on the self?
Similarly, we have experienced different kinds of good and
bad scents. But is there any difference in the self, because of -
those different scents? |
The five senses of hearing, sight, touch (skin), taste and
smell, have affinity respectively, for five organs of actions— :
tongue, feet, hands, genital organ and anus. If one who is ST

a healthy effect on his sight; hands can be used to touch an
Object, because of skin; control over the tongue, controls the
genital organ; smell makes its entrance through nose, while it
makes its exit through anus.
The five sense-organs, the five organs of action and the five
senses, are formed respectively,out of portion of the mode of
goodness, the mode of passion and the mode of ignorance, of
each of the five subtle elements.

'Visayanupasevate'—If a businessman, stops his business at
one place and starts it at another due to some reason, so does soul -
migrate, from one body to another, and It starts enjoying the objects
of senses, in the new body also, as it did in the first body, because
of Its past habit. Thus an embodied soul, has to be born in good 7
and evil wombs, because of its attachment, to sense-objects.
God has bestowed this human body upon us, to enable us
to attain salvation, rather than to enjoy pleasure or to experience :
pain. As we can feed a cow which is given to a Brahmana as ~
a charity, but we cannot lay claim to its milk, so can we make
proper use of the body bestowed upon us by God, but we cannot
enjoy, the objects of senses with it. |
The more the embodied soul enjoys, the objects of senses,
the more It is attached, to them. This attachment leads it to
rebirth and all sorrows. In fact, the pleasure born of contact
with objects of senses is illusory and source of sorrow, but these
seem pleasant in the beginning out of ignorance, (Gita 18/38). | |
"
1693,"Verse 9} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1639
Had there been happiness in sense-objects, prosperous persons |
possessing all the luxuries would have been happy, but they
also undergo sufferings and disquietude. Enjoyment of pleasure, _
results in loss of wealth, health, quietude, patience, happiness /
and honour etc.* | | oO

As thirst is not quenched by drinking water in a dream, so |
can a man not attain peace, by enjoying objects of senses. A man
thinks, that he will attain peace through prosperity and pleasure.
But the more prosperity he acquires and the more pleasure he
enjoys, the keener desire he has, to acquire and enjoy theset.
""All the riches of the world, all beautiful women, all excellent -
objects cannot satisfy a man even if he acquires all of them""
(Visnupurana 4/10/24; Maha. Adi. 85/13). Because the soul, is a
fragment of God and is sentient, while sense-objects, are fragments -
of prakrti (Nature) and are insentient. So how can insentient
and perishable, satisfy the sentient and imperishable? As thirst
cannot be quenched, even by the most delicious dishes without -
water, so can, the thirst for God-realization, not be quenched by
insentient mundane objects. The more he possesses them, the ~
more hungry, he feels.

If a striver, has a resolve this very day, that he has not to
enjoy objects of senses. Then the thought of these ceases to come /
to his mind, and it leads him to be pure and evenminded. Those,
who gain equanimity of mind, naturally realize God (Gita 5/19),
because He is ever-attained. But He remains veiled, because of
a striver's attachment, to objects of senses.

*We have not enjoyed pleasures (the objects of senses). The objects of
senses have enjoyed us; we have not performed penances, penances have burnt
us; time has not been spent, we have been spent; desire has not decayed but
we have decayed. |

 ""Utkramantam'—The soul (self), while giving up a physical
body, departs taking the subtle body and the causal body with It.
So.long as, the heart beats, the soul dwells, in that body. Even
"
1695,"Verse 10} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1641
when the heart stops beating, the soul may stay for sometime. |
In fact, the soul being immovable and sentient, does not migrate,
it is the life-breath, which migrates. But, It is said to migrate,
because of its attachment, for the subtle body and the causal. body. -
_- The term ""Utkramati"", used for the Jivatma, (embodied soul)
which assumes itself, as the lord, as mentioned in the eighth |
verse, has been called here ""Utkramantam' (depart). : |
'Sthitarh va'—As a camera takes a picture of an object as itis
reflected, so is the subtle body formed, according to the thought
which a person has at the time of death. As the process of making
photograph takes’ sometime, so the physical body to be prepared .
according to the thought of the last moment takes sometime. -
_ The term, which has been described as Yadavapnoti, in the
eighth verse has been called 'Sthitam', here. _
‘Api bhufijanam va'—When a man enjoys objects of senses,
of sound, touch, form, taste and smell, he thinks that he is very :
careful, he knows the objects of senses well, and enjoys them, :
carefully. But in fact, he is deluded, as their enjoyment leads
him to hell and evil wombs. -
- Philosophers and- scriptures have different opinions about
God, the soul and the world. But all of them agree, that the.
soul, suffers because of Its attachment to the world and attains
bliss, by having affinity for God. | :
The deluded hear, study and also declare, that the world is |
transient and kaleidoscopic, yet they assume it as permanent,
because they cannot enjoy the objects of senses without regarding
these as real or permanent. A voluptuary, becomes so much |
deluded that he regards gratification of lust, as his highest aim
(Gita 16/11). So his eyes of wisdom ever remain shut. People
know, that they have to die, because they are living in a world
of mortals, yet they want to live, in order to enjoy sense-objects.
The term 'Api’, denotes that when soul having given up one
"
1696,"1642 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 15 ,

body, migrates (with subtle body and causal body) to another, to

acquire it and enjoys the objects of senses, It in spite of appearing

attached to the modes, actually remains detached. In fact, the -

soul (self), neither departs, nor stays, nor enjoys, Itself. ;
The expression 'Visayanupasevate’ used in the preceding

verse, has been termed here as 'Bhufjanam'’. |
‘Gunanvitam'—It means, that it is because of assumed contact

of the soul with the modes, that activities of departure, stay and

enjoyment, appear in It. |
In fact, the soul has no affinity for modes, but by an error It .

assumes Its affinity for them, in order to derive pleasure out of -

the world, and so It has to take birth in high and low bodies.

A man, in order to derive pleasure, out of the world,
assumes his affinity for persons and objects of the world. An -
orator regards an audience as his, a person having no son,
adopts a boy as his son, he who has no real brother, or sister, -
assumes relationship of a brother or a sister, with someone else,
and so on. The Lord declares, that the embodied soul, in spite
of being transcendental (beyond gunas), in its intrinsic nature, ”
by assuming relationship with gunas (space, time, individual,
object), gets into bondage. |

The expression 'Prakrtisthani’, used in the seventh verse |
stands for the expression ‘'Gunanvitam’, used here. | a
So long as, a man 1s in the least attached to prakrti (nature)
and its evolute, the modes, he is made to act helplessly, by the
modes of nature (Gita 3/5). If he (the sentient self) depends on
insentient nature, he suffers from the evil of impurity. Even when,
he totally becomes free from modes of Nature, but relishes this
freedom (because of the trace of egoism), the evil of egoism
persists. But, when he ceases to relish it, his evil egoism comes
to an end, and his devotion accelerates, continuously. The
"
1697,"Verse 10] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1643 |

supreme aim of a man, is to attain this devotion. Having attained -

this devotion (love), a devotee attains perfection. The Lord, having

bestowed upon His devotee this unique devotion, gets pleased and

considers him the most devout, among all the Yogis (Gita 6/47). ;
A man, transcends the three modes of Nature by practising

the spiritual disciplines through his discrimination, but having

transcended the three modes of Nature, he attains devotion (love)

to Him through His. grace only. | |
'Vimiidha nanupasyanti'—As, we remain the same, while

performing different actions, so.does the self (soul), remain the

same while giving up one body, acquiring another body and -

enjoying the objects of senses. But he, who having identified

the self with the body, thinks he is a doer (3/27) is a deluded

one, who does not behold reality. _
The deluded are so much attached to pleasure and prosperity

that they do not realize the fact, that mundane objects, such

as body etc., are perishable. Moreover, they do not think, that -

sensual pleasures, are sources of sorrow. While describing the

food of three kinds in the seventeenth chapter, which are dear -

to the good, the passionate and the ignorant, the Lord, first has

given the effect of food liked by the good (Sattvika), the effect

of the food liked by the passionate (Rajasika), has been given :

afterwards, while no remark has been given, of the food, which -

is dear to the ignorant (Tamasika) (Gita 17/8—10). Why? The

reason 1s, that a good person thinks of the fruit, before performing

an action, the passionate first performs the action and then reaps

its fruit, while the ignorant person, does not think of the result at

all. So the Lord here, means to say, that the deluded (delusion is

a trait of the ignorant): while enjoying objects of senses, do not

think, of the result, of sensual enjoyment. They remain; engrossed

in pleasure and prosperity. Their knowledge remains veiled, by

the mode of ignorance and therefore they cannot distinguish,

the soul from the body. |
"
1698,"1644 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 15 |
'Pasyanti jianacaksusah'—All the beings, objects, incident and
circumstances, are kaleidoscopic i.e., the seen, is changing, into
. the unseen. This is known as beholding with an eye of wisdom. -
The unchanging (permanent), can perceive the changing. :
A wise man, also give up a physical body, but he neither
acquires another body nor does he enjoy the objects of senses,
with attachment. The Lord, in the thirteenth verse of the second
chapter, declares, ""Just as, in this body the embodied (soul) passes
through childhood, youth and old age, so also, does It pass into
another body. But the wise man, is not deluded (perplexed) by .
this."" The reason is, that a wise man beholds, with an eye -
of wisdom, that all activities, such as birth or death etc., or
modifications occur, in the kaleidoscopic body, rather than, in
the uniform self. The self, ever remains free, totally from all -
modifications. It is because of identification with a body and
because of the desire to derive pleasures out of it, that a man
feels modification, in him (the self). The deluded, behold the :
soul connected with the modes, while the wise behold It, in
reality, free from contact, with modes. -
Appendix—A man (the Self) by assuming his identity with
the gunas (modes) becomes ‘gunanvita’. If he does not assume
his affinity with the modes, he is nirguna (free from the three
modes)—“‘anaditvannirgunatvat’ (Gita 13/31). It means that
attachment to the modes causes his birth and death (Gita 13/21).
Though no one wants his degradation (downfall), yet because of
his attachment to sense pleasures, he does not know the means
of his progress. He sees his progress in acquiring perishable
objects but the result is his much degradation. -
Departing from one body, dwelling in the other body and
enjoying the sense-objects—these are three different activities but
the Self dwelling in them is the same—in spite of this clear fact
an indiscriminative person does not know it viz., he does not
pay attention to his experience and does not attach importance ;
"
1699,"Verse 11] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1645 |
to his experience. Being deluded by the three modes, he remains
unconscious (Gita 7/13). The Self does not stay with any state
continuously—this is everyone’s experience. Its untaintedness 7
is self-evident. oe
The Lord in the preceding verse mentioned five actions—
hearing, seeing, touching, tasting and smelling, while in this
verse He has mentioned three actions—departing from one body, |
dwelling in the other body and enjoying the sense-objects. Out
of these eight, no action persists continuously, but the Self ever
remains the same. Actions are eight in number but in all of them |
the Self remains only one. Therefore everyone knows their presence -
and disappearance, their beginning and end. But the person (the
Self) who knows the beginning and the end, is eternal. ©
There is supposed union and gradual disunion of the body, -
objects and every pleasure. The Self remains one in all the states
and in spite of being one, passes through several states. Had the
Self not remained one and the same, who would have known the -
different states? Though this fact is quite clear, yet the deluded
people don’t perceive (realize) the reality, but the Yogis who -
possess the eye of wisdom, perceive this reality. |

Comment:— | , | |

'Yatanto yoginaScainarh pasyanti'—Here the term 'Yoginah’,
stands for those strivers following the path of knowledge, whose .
only aim is God-realization. |

The. term 'Yatantah, here stands for 'striving’, with a firm
determination from the heart. |

Strivers whose only aim is God-realization, become
automatically free from attachment; a sense of mine and the
desire for fruit. They strive with exclusive devotion, and so
yeaming, promptness, restlessness and thoughtfulness, are
naturally revealed, in them. This is all included in the term -
""Yatantah'’, used here. Such strivers, who strive with exclusive
devotion and firm determination, having a disinclination for the
world, perceive Him established in the self. The term 'Pasyanti’, -
stands for this perception. _

Such strivers, who want to attain the real (God-realization),
and renounce the unreal (world), perceive Him, as established in -
the self, when their discrimination, is fully aroused.

‘Atmanyavasthitam'—God (The Supreme Being) always
equally pervades everywhere. He is the self, seated in the hearts
of all beings, (Gita 10/20). Therefore, the Yogis (sages) realize
(behold) Him, in the self.

Existence is of two kinds—(1) That which undergoes
modifications or changeable (2) Axiomatic (self-evident). The
existence, which has its appearance after being born, is called
changeable existence, while existence which is never born, but
which exists eternally, and remains as it is, in a uniform way, is
called, axiomatic existence. The world and the bodies, undergo
modifications, while God and the soul are self-evident. It is
an error, to identify the self, with the body.* When a striver

* A man identifies the self with the body and has egoistic notion. Similarly
he regards the body as ‘mine’. It is because of his egoistic notion that the body
seems real to him and it is because of the sense of mine with the body that
he is attached to it.
"
1701,"Verse 11] ~ SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1647
renounces, this identity as well as a sense of mine, he gets 7
established, in the self. | |

When a man does not attach importance to discrimination,
bestowed upon him by God, he is bound through egoism, and -
a sense of ‘mine’. This affinity is so much strengthened, that it |
continues even after death, and it is also so brittle, that it can be
broken anytime and a man is free, in maintaining it or renouncing :
it. By misusing this freedom, he creates affinity with body, etc.,
which does not belong to his class.

When a man does not attach importance to discrimination, it |
is veiled and then the body seems real. But, by good company -
and the study of the scriptures etc., as this discrimination is
unveiled, the assumed affinity for the body, is renounced. When
discrimination is fully unveiled (aroused), a striver realizes that _
he is naturally established, in the self. This is what the Lord
means by the expression, 'Atmani avasthitam’.

Egoism is born by the attachment of a man (the self), to -
the world. Egoism can be of two kinds—(1) Through hearing
from others— ‘I am' Mohana or Syama and T’ am Brahmana -
or Ksatriya (2) Through the performance of actions—T am an
orator, a teacher or a physician, through speech, teaching and
treating patients. But this egoism, is a temporary phase. When |
it is renounced, a striver realizes, that he is established, in the ;
self which is self-existent. |

(1) God in the form of 'Is', Who pervades everywhere,
as the illuminator and base of 'T’, ‘you’, 'this' and ‘that’. These
four ever undergo changes, while He (Is) never undergoes,
any change. Moreover, it is because of his egoistic notion,
that a man feels, that he is different from others i.e., he has
to use ‘am’, because he says 'I', otherwise there is only ‘Is’.
"
1702,"1648 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 15
Till, 'I'ness persists, there is individuality or finiteness. On its
effacement only s' 1.€., the Absolute, remains. oo
'‘Atmani avasthitam'—-means that there.is, 'Is' in 'Am' and -
‘Am’ in 'Ts'. In other words, there is macro in micro and micro
in macro. An individual and the society cannot be separated
from each other, in the same way, as the waves and the sea,
cannot be separated from each other. But, as in the element
water, neither the sea nor the waves are there, so is God free,
from an individual or society. When a Striver, realizes this fact,
he realizes, that He is established, in the self. = s—™
A man cannot realize, that He is established in the self, =
because of his attachment to the world, to derive pleasure out
of it and because of his disinclination for Him. So long as it is
not realized that the self is God, we feel God as separate and -
away from us and we have to make efforts to achieve God and
there separation is a must when he renounces attachment to the
body, he realizes (beholds), that He is established, in the. self ~
and does not suffer pain of separation, from Him.*
He who beholds God, in the self, does not support the -
opinion, that God is different from the self. It is the sense. of
- T' ness, which separates the self from God. In fact, the self has
no evil, such as ‘T'ness or dependence or shortage or ignorance
etc. But, by an error a man (the self), assumes that they are in -
him. In order to remove these evils, he should behold Him, in
the self. When he beholds Him, in the self, he becomes free
from all evils, because in Him, there is no evil.
As the world is kaleidoscopic, so is IT’, because it is a
fragment of the world, as ""I am a boy"", ""I am young"", ""I am
old"", ""I am sick"", ""I am healthy"" and so on.f Both the world and
* Only wise who constantly behold God in the self. attain eternal bliss
(Katha, 2/2/13).
{ Here a doubt may arise that the states of boyhood and youth etc., change
but ‘I’ remains the same. The explanation is 'T’ seems the same because of
"
1703,"Verse 11] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1649
'l', are perishable, while the self and God are imperishable. As
the world has no existence, so does 'T also, have no existence. :

Saint Sundaradasa declares, ""We see what does not exist, -
but we do not see what exists."" The reason is, that instruments
such as, the mind, intellect and senses etc., with which we see,
also do not exist. So the unreal can be seen, with the help of
the unreal, the real cannot be seen, with the help of unreal.

Moreover, the unreal seems to exist, in the light of the :
real. The real is the illuminator, and the base, of the unreal. As .
we can see the world, with the eye, but we cannot see the eye
with it, so how can God, Who is the knower of all, be known :
by: them? How can the unreal, which is illumined by the real,
illumine the real? :

The self, can be realized by the self, rather than by senses, -
mind and intellect etc. Similarly God, Who is established in
the self, can also be realized by the self, rather than through
discourses or through intellect or through hearing* as the senses, -
the mind and the intellect etc., are evolutes of Nature. How can
He, Who transcends Nature, be known by the evolutes of Nature? ;
Therefore, when a striver, renounces his affinity for nature, he
realizes Him, in the self.

A striver, commits an error, that he wants to know God,
in the same way, as he knows the world. But the methods of -
knowing the two, are contrary to each other. The world can be
known by medium (means), such as senses, mind and intellect
etc., while God cannot be known by them, because He is beyond
its identity with the reality (sentient). In fact the iNuminator of 'T' (i.e., the
self) remains the same while there is a subtle change in T’. 'I' is not the same
in youth as 'T' was in boyhood. Similarly there is change in 'T’ when the soul
passes into another body though the self remains the same (Gita 2/13).

*(1) God can be realized neither through discourses, nor through intellect
nor through much hearing (Katha. 1/2/23).

(2) God can be realized neither through speech nor through mind nor
through eyes (Katha. 2/3/12). |
"
1704,"1650 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 15
their access, as He is transcendental. . |

The sentient, cannot be realized, by depending on, the
insentient. Those who, having depended on Matter, or the -
insentient (physical, subtle and causal bodies), want to realize |
God, cannot realize Him, even through trance, because a trance
also depends, on the causal body.* |

The wise, who know that God is theirs, and they are God's,

: with the eye of wisdom, having separated the self, from the body,
senses, mind and intellect etc., realize him. But those unwise and
unenlightened people; who regard the body as theirs, and who -
consider themselves of the body, even though striving, do not, ~
realize God, Who is established, in the self. :

(2) 'Atmani avasthitam'—The Lord has declared, that -
He is established in the self, of all beings (1.e., He pervades
everywhere). In order to realize this fact, a striver should believe
in the following four points:— | -

1. God is, here.

2. God is, now. |

_ 3. God is, in me. | |

4. God is, mine.

As God pervades everywhere, He is also here. As He existed |
in the past, exists at present and will also exist in future, He

* A man acts with the physical body, thinks with the subtle body and

experiences trance with the causal body.

The causal body and the trance experienced with it in spite of being |
superior to wakefulness, sleep and sound sleep are in their subtle form constantly ;
active. When a person transcends the causal body, only the self remains. This
is the constant trance of the self, which transcends both activity and inactivity
i.e., when a man realizes the self there is neither activity nor inactivity. There
is deviation from the trance of the causal body. But in the trance of the self
viz., on Self-realization there is neither trance nor deviation. This is known as
‘seedless trance’ because in it the .connection (seed) with the world is totally
destroyed. This is also known as ‘Sahajavastha' (innate or natural condition)
though it transcends all conditions. -
"
1705,"Verse 11] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1651 |
is also, now. As He pervades all, He also pervades me, and as |
He is everyone's, He is also, mine. From these facts it is very
obvious— | :
i. As God is here, we need not go anywhere, to realize |
Him. Oo
2. As God is present now, we need not wait, for future.
3. As He is in me, I need. not search Him, anywhere
outside. |
4. As He is mine, I need not regard, others as mine. He is |
also very loving to me, because He is mine. |
These four points are very significant and useful, for all -
strivers. This realization is the quintessence of all spiritual
practices. It needs no qualification, no practice, no ability and
no virtue. Everyone is qualified, deserving and able, in believing = —
it. The. only condition is, that he should have only the desire
for God-realization. , -
""Yatanto'pyakrtatmano nainam paSsyantyacetasah'— ‘Akrtat-
manah' are those unrefined people, who have not purified their
mind, they have been called 'Acetasah’ (unintelligent), because :
they do not discriminate, the real from the unreal.
| Those, who regard mundane objects, such as the body and
also persons as theirs, and expect to derive pleasure, out of them,
by attaching importance to them, are unintelligent and unrefined.
Such people, also want to realize God, but they want to realize
Him, with the help of insentient objects, such as body, mind and
intellect etc. As He cannot be realized with their help, He can
be realized, by renouncing attachment, to them.
In this verse the term ‘Yatantah’, has been used twice, in
order to explain that the wise perceive Him by striving, while
the unintelligent do not behold Him, even by striving. It means,
that so long as, a man is attached to worldly objects, he cannot
realize God, with body, senses, mind and intellect, though these
"
1706,"1652 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 15
are useful, in making effort to attain Him. How can those, who |
have an eye on the unreal (mundane pleasures and prosperity), |
behold Him? ;
Unrefined and unintelligent people, also meditate on God, :
study scriptures and chant His name, but they cannot behold
Him, because they attach importance, to mundane objects
(pleasures and prosperity). Though their efforts are not in vain, .
_ yet they cannot realize Him, at the present moment. He can be
realized immediately, if a striver renounces attachment to the
insentient, totally. ,
A striver cannot renounce attachment to insentient body, mind —-
| and intellect etc., so long as, he depends upon them. Moreover,
he possesses egoism, in its subtle form, if he practises spiritual
discipline with the help of mind and intellect etc. He can be .
free, from this subtle egoism by renouncing attachment, to the
insentient. This attachment, can be easily renounced, when a
striver totally depends on God 1.e., he firmly believes and accepts ;
the reality 'I am God's and God is mine’. It needs, neither effort
nor practice.
Appendix——Neither pleasure nor prosperity stays permanently
with us—a man naturally has this discretion. But the people,
who in spite of studying the scriptures, keeping good company .
and practising spiritual discipline, don’t pay attention to their -
discretion and don’t realize that.they are different from pleasures
and prosperity, are ‘akrtatma’ viz., they have not purified their
hearts. Such people in the sixteenth verse of the eighteenth chapter
have been called ‘akrtabuddhi’ (of impure or untrained mind) and
‘durmati’ (of perverse understanding). Though God-realization /
is not difficult, yet in spite of practising the spiritual discipline,
they don’t know God because of their attachment and desire for
worldly pleasures. The reason is that discretion does not stick in
those people who hanker after pleasures and prosperity. _
In the preceding verse the people who have been called
"
1707,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI _ 1653 7
‘vimadhah’ (deluded), here have been called ‘aéetasah’
(unintelligent). Being deluded by modes, they neither know the
division of sense-objects nor that of the Self viz., they don’t |
know that the Self is different from pleasures of which there is | |
supposed union and gradual disunion with it. |
. In this topic from the seventh verse to the eleventh verse, |
the Lord wants to explain that His fragment, the Soul, is totally
different from the materials (bodies, objects and actions) which
by an error he regards as his own—these materials are evolutes
of prakrti—‘prakrtisthani’. Both are totally different in the same
way as are the sun and the darkest night of amavasya (last day .
of the dark half of a month). Their. union is impossible. He -
who perceives that the sentient and the insentient are totally
different from each other, is wise and is a Yogi (sage). But he /
who perceives the sentient (the Self), identified with the insentient ,
(matter), is ignorant and a ‘bhogi’ (voluptuary).

Comment:— : :

[It is a man's nature, that he is attracted towards a thing,
which he feels as, significant. He is attached to material objects
(body, wife, son and riches etc.,) by regarding these as significant. :
Therefore the Lord, in order to, efface the influence of worldly
objects from the mind of the embodied soul, discloses the secret,
that whatever significance or splendour there is, of those material
objects, that is really (basically) His, as all of these are illumined,
by His light as He is supremely glorious.] 7

'Yadadityagatam tejo jagadbhasayate'khilam'—As the Lord
(in 2/55) declares, that desire resides in the mind so does He =
here declare, that light (splendour) resides in the sun. It means .
that as desires appear in the mind though they are not of the
mind, so does the light appear that it is of the sun, though it is -
not, it comes from God. :

The light (splendour), of the sun illumines the whole world,
but that light is really God's, though it appears to be of the sun, -
as the sun cannot illumine God or His Supreme Abode. The
great sage Patanjali, declares— _ -

""God is the preceptor of the ancestor of all beings, because
He transcends the limit of time"" (Yogadarsana 1/26).

How much influential and unique, God must be when His .
light (splendour), is so unique, that with it the sun illumines the
world and the same light is reflected in the moon, the fire, the
stars and the lightning (electricity) etc.! By thinking so, a man
is naturally attracted towards Him.

The sun is the presiding deity of eyes. Therefore, light
(power of sight) in eyes, should also be regarded as God's
(coming from Him).

""Yaccandramasi'—As the illuminating power, as well as, the
burning power in the sun, is God's, so is illuminating power or the
cooling power, as well as, the nourishing power, in the moon, is _ -
"
1709,"Verse 12) , SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1655 :
God's; because, in the moon the light of the sun, is reflected.

Here, the moon also denotes, stars and planets. |

The moon is the presiding deity of the mind. Therefore, -
light (power of thought), in the mind should also be regarded,
as transmitted in succession from God. ;

'Yaccagnau'—As the sun's light, is reflected in the fire, so
is the fire's Uluminating power, as well as, the burning power
God's; rather than of the fire. | :

The fire, also denotes lightning (electricity), a lamp and -
fire-flies.. | | -

Fire, is the presiding deity of speech. Therefore, the light (power
of explanation) in the speech, should also be regarded as God's.

'Tattejo viddhi mamakam'—The light, which resides in the sun, —
the moon and the fire and which illumines, other objects (stars,
planets, lightning and fire-fly etc.,) should be regarded, as God's.

The Lord means, that whatever being or object there is glorious -
or splendid, and to which, a man is attracted, is a manifestation
of a part, of His splendour (Gita 10/41). As in sweetmeats, there -
is sweetness of sugar, so is the light (splendour), in the sun, the
moon and the fire of God’s. The whole world, is illumined by
His light. He is the light, of all lights (Gita 13/17). :

The sun, the moon and the fire, are the presiding deities and
illuminators respectively, of the eye, the mind and speech. A
man, in order to express his thoughts or feelings and in order to
understand them, has to use his eyes, mind and tongue. These
three sense-organs, are more useful than other organs, in order -
to gain knowledge. Out of these three, the eye arid the tongue,
are external organs, while the mind is an internal one. These
three instruments, (organs) can illumine only worldly objects.
They cannot illumine God, because the light residing in them,
is not theirs but is God's.

Appendix—God is the source of all powers. In this connection ;
"
1710,"1656 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 15
there is an anecdote in the Kenopanisad. Once God got victory

_ over demons for gods. But the gods became proud of their power
for this victory. They thought that they could get victory over -
demons with their own power. In order to destroy their false
pride, God revealed Himself before them as a “Yaksa’ (demigod).
Having seen the ‘Yaksa’ the gods were surprised and began to
think who he was? The gods sent the Fire-god to him so that
they could know who he was. Yaksa asked the Fire-god who
he was? The Fire-god said, “I am the famous Fire-god named _
‘Jataveda’ and I can burn everything on the earth to ashes, if I |
so wish.” Then the demigod put a straw before him and asked -
him to burn it. The Fire-god made the best possible efforts but
he could not burn it. Being ashamed of his failure, he returned
to the gods and said that he could not know who that demigod _
was. Then the Wind-god approached him to know who he was.
The demigod asked the Wind-god who he was. The Wind-god
said, “I am the famous Wind-god named ‘Matarisva’ and if | -
wish, I may blow off everything which is there on the earth.”
Then the demigod put a straw before him and asked him to blow -
it off. The Wind-god could not blow it off in spite of applying
his full power. Being ashamed of his failure, he returned to the
gods and said that he could not know who the demigod was. |
Then gods commissioned Indra to Yaksa in order to know who
he was. As soon as Indra reached there, the demigod disappeared
and in place of the demigod, Umadevi, the daughter of Himacala
appeared. Having been asked by Indra, Umadevi replied that
God revealed Himself in the form of a Yaksa in order to crush
their pride. It means that in the entire universe whatever power .
or speciality or singularity is perceived that has emanated only
from God (Gita 10/41). :

It means, that the movable as well as immovable beings, are
supported not by the power of the earth, but by the power of God.*
Scientists also agree, that on this globe, water level is higher -
than the land, and there is much more water, than landT, yet the

The moon, in the bright half of the lunar month nourishes
vegetation, while in the dark half it withers it. In the bright half,
the sweet rays of the moon, nourish all herbs and plants, by |
infusing sap into them. A child in the womb of its mother, also
grows in the bright half of a lunar month.

Here the term 'Somah’, stands for the 'Candraloka' (the lunar
world), rather than only the moon. The moon, has not only the
illuminating power, but also the power to create nectar. Nectar °
first comes to the moon from the lunar world, and then it comes :
to the earth, from the moon. | -

Here the term 'Ausadhih' stands for different kinds of corn,
such as wheat and gram etc. The moon nourishes all herbs, plants _

power of the moon, is in fact of God, rather than its own. The -
moon is merely an instrument on His hands.

of the cosmic life, in the preceding verse, in the next verse, He
explains how He digests food, through the gastric fire.

of food. 14 |

Comment:— | |
‘Aham vaisvanaro bhitva praninam dehamasritah'— Having

described the light in the fire as His light, in the twelfth verse, :

here in this verse He describes, the gastric fire, that digests the |

four kinds of food.* It means, that it is by God's power, that

the fire illumines objects and also digests food. This fire, digests _

food of immovable creation such as plants, trees and creepers,

of movable beings such as birds and beasts etc., as it digests, the

food of human beings and enables them to grow. It means, that -

God in the form of gastric fire, nourishes the bodies of beings. |
‘Pranapanasamayuktah'—In the body, there are five primary -

vital airs, known as ‘Prana’, ‘Apana’, ‘Samana’, ‘Udana’ and ""Vyana’

and there are five secondary vital airs known as 'Naga’, ‘Kurma’,

'Krkara', 'Devadatta’ and ""Dhanafijaya'.t In the verse, the Lord
* The fire that abides in the stomach is called Vaisvanara and it digests

the food which is eaten.

t The functions of these ten vital airs are as follows:— |
(1) Prana:—It resides in the heart. It exhales air, digests the food

and so on. . -
(2) Apana:—lIt resides in anus. It inhales air, excretes waste matter and

throw out ithe foetus from the womb.

(3) Samana:—It resides in the navel. It circulates the essence of the

digested food in all the limbs. .

(4) Udana:—lIt abides in the throat. It separates the solid and the liquid

portions of food. It separates the subtle body from the physical body and ;

transmigrates it to another body or to the world.
"
1714,"1660 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 15
describes, only two main kinds of -vital air— Prana and Apana
which fan the fire, that abides in the stomach and also circulate
the essence of the digested food, to every part of the body. -

'Pacimyannarn caturvidham'—Beings, eat four kinds of food—

(1) Bhojya:—That which is eaten, having been chewed with
teeth, such as bread and sweet cake etc. : :

(2) Peya:—That which is swallowed, as milk and juice etc.

(3) Cosya:—That which is sucked, such as sugarcane and
mango etc. The immovable beings, such as tree etc., receive :
food, in this way. -

(4) Lehya:—That which has to be licked such, as sauce
and honey etc. |

These four kinds, can further be divided into many other -
sub-kinds. The Lord, declares that it is He, Who digests the
four kinds of food, by becoming gastric fire. No food, can be
digested without His power. -

Appendix—Entering the earth to support all beings, becoming
the moon to nourish all vegetation, and becoming the gastric fire -
to digest the food in the living creatures—all these activities are
carried out by God’s power. But a man by regarding them to
be done by himself, feels proud for nothing—‘aharh karomiti |
vithabhimanah’; as a dog, which moves under the bullock-cart :
in its shade, thinks that it itself alone drives the bullock-cart.

(5) Vyana:—It abides in whole of the body. It shrinks and expands the
body and its parts. ;

(6) Naga:—It's function is belching.

(7) Kurma:— It's function is shutting and opening the eyes.

(8) Krkara:—It's function is sneezing.

(9) Devadatta:—It's function is yawning.

(10) Dhanafijaya:—It abides in the body even after death and puffs out
the dead body. In fact, only one vital air is differentiated according to its
various functions.

digesting powers, in the preceding three verses, the Lord in the
next verse, while concluding the topic, declares that He is the
only object, worth knowing. |

interpreter and knower of the Vedas too. 15
Comment:— _

‘Sarvasya caham hrdi sannivistah*'—Having described His
illuminating, nourishing and digesting powers, in the preceding
verses, the Lord discloses the secret, that He is lodged in the :
hearts of all beings. Though He remains pervaded everywhere, :
such as in the body, senses, mind and intellect etc., yet, He
specially resides, in the heart.

The heart, is an important part of the body. All the feelings
arise in the heart. Feelings occupy an important place in all -
actions. Pure feelings purify all objects and actions etc., and |
therefore, are very important. The heart is an evolute, of the mode

* The two birds named the soul and God live together with friendly feeling
for each other by depending on the same tree i.e., body. Out of the two one (the
soul) enjoys the fruits of that tree (action) by relishing them while the other one
(God) does not enjoy them but merely remains a spectator (Mundaka 3/1/1).
"
1716,"1662 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter15
of goodness; therefore, the Lord is specially lodged, in the heart.

_ As the Lord dwells in the hearts of all men, no striver,
should lose heart, as far as God-realization is concerned. Every
person, whether he 1s sinful or virtuous, foolish or wise, poor.”
or rich, sick or healthy or whether she is a woman, without any
distinction of caste, creed; colour, order of life, is fully qualified
for and deserving of God-realization, under all circumstances. But
he or she, should possess such a burning desire or restlessness,
that he or she may not remain, without realizing Him.

Though God, being omnipresent, pervades equally everywhere, __
in the sun, the moon, the fire, the earth and the gastric fire etc., :
yet He is particularly seated in the heart, in the same way, as milk
can be available from the udders of a cow, though it pervades
her entire body or as water, is available from a well, though it = _
permeates the entire earth (Gita 13/17; 18/61).

An Important Fact .

In fact, God is already attained to all human beings, as He ~~
dwells in their hearts, but they do not realize His existence, in
their hearts because of their assumed affinity (attachment) for
Matter, (the world). As soon as, there is total renouncement of
this affinity for Matter,.they automatically, realize Him. |

When a person performs virtuous actions for Him, talks

of Him and thinks of Him, he has to depend on Matter (the
insentient and the unreal), because performance of actions or
talking or thinking of Him is not possible, without depending on
the insentient (gross, subtle and causal bodies). So these should
induce a man, to renounce his affinity for the world, and that is
possible only when these (virtuous actions, talking of God and
thinking of Him) are done, for the welfare of the world only,
rather than, for one’s own self.

Those, who think that God can be realized, through spiritual
"
1717,"Verse 15] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1663 |

practice or virtues or qualifications etc., are wrong. A thing, |

that is acquired by making some payment, for it, is of lesser

value, than that payment (price). So if God 1s attained by certain |

spiritual practice or virtues or qualifications etc., it means, that

He is less valuable than those means, while there is none even

equal to Him, so how can anyone or anything be superior (of

more value) to Him, (Gita 11/43)? Moreover, if He is secured

(realized) for some money (by any means), it means, that there

is not much use in realizing Him, because we already possess

something more valuable, than He. | | :
As God-realization, is not the fruit of actions, so he cannot :

be achieved through actions like other objects. Every action, is

born of egoistic notions while God is realized when egoism

is renounced. So how can He, be realized through actions? It -

means that God cannot be realized, through actions. It means that

God cannot be realized, through insentient objects, such as the

body, senses, mind and intellect etc., but, He can be realized by oo

renouncing affinity (attachment), for them. So long as a striver,

depends upon them, he cannot realize God. God can be realized, _

through mind and intellect etc.,—this belief is a blunder. But,

as soon as, he depends only on Him, without depending on any

other object, He is attained, without delay. |
‘Mattah smrtirjianamapohanam ca'—Smrti, means the -

recollection of an object or incident etc., which was perceived

in the past, by a person, but which he forgot. There is difference

between 'Smrti' (recollection) and 'Cintana’ (thinking). There

is ‘Smrti' of something of the past, while there is ‘Cintana’ -

of something new. So there is ‘Smrti’ of God, while there is

‘Cintana’, of the world, because the world did not exist before,

while God has existed, since time immemorial. There is not so

much power in 'Cintana, as is there in ‘Smrti'. In 'Smrti' there is

less sense of doership, while in 'Cintana’, there is more sense of

doership. This recollection can be of two kinds—natural and by
"
1718,"1664 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 15
effort. The former is automatically remained in the self, while
the latter is made by intellect. - o oe
| Memory is of two types—One is resorted to, while the other

is automatic (natural). The former is through intellect, while the
latter is, through the self. Natural recollection aids a man, to
renounce his affinity for the world, instantly. So, the Lord declares
that He is a source of this natural-recollection (memory).

What is the memory? Memory is that the soul in spite of
being a fragment of God, by an error, has an inclination for the
world and a disinclination for God. But when a man rectifies
this error, and realizes that he is only God's, and not of the -
world, it is called 'Smrti’ (memory or recollection) (Gita 18/73).

In memory, no new knowledge or experience, is gained. There .
is only a revelation of a fact, which he forgot, that a person, _
has his real affinity for God. oe :

A man (the soul) is naturally endowed with, selflessness
(Karmayoga), Self-realization (Jianayoga or the path of knowledge) _~
and Devotion to God, (Bhaktiyoga or the path of devotion). But, |
he has forgotten these since time immemorial. Once he regains -
this memory, he never loses it, because it is regained (aroused) in
the self, rather than in the intellect. The memory of the intellect,
can be lost, when intellect becomes dull. : :

Knowledge of a subject is called ‘Jnana’. All the mundane,
as well as, spiritual knowledge, is merely a reflection of God,
Who is an embodiment of knowledge. In fact, real knowledge
is known by the self. There is no doubt or confusion (illusion)
in this knowledge, as it is infinite, perfect and eternal, while .
knowledge of senses and intellect is limited, imperfect and
changeable, as such, there is doubt or confusion (illusion) in
it. The sun, in spite of being large looks small, it means that
knowledge of senses, is imperfect. Similarly, what is felt justified
by the undeveloped intellect, may be unjustified, when intellect
is developed or purified. Thus, knowledge gained by senses and
"
1719,"Verse 15] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 1665

mind, is limited and imperfect. This imperfect knowledge is called

ignorance, while knowledge of the self, is perfect. In fact, the

knowledge of senses and intellect is illumined, by knowledge of |

the self i.e., the former, comes into existence, by the latter.

Removal of doubt, confusion, illusion, misapprehension and
fallacious judgment, etc., is, 'Apohana’. The Lord declares, that
these are removed, by His grace. _

Are the scriptures true or false? Who has seen God? The :
world is real. Such types of doubts, confusion and illusions, are 2
removed by God's grace. The misapprehension that the world,
is real or mundane objects provide real joy, is also removed, -
by His grace. At the end of the gospel of the Gita Arjuna also
declares, ""{ have gained my knowledge (memory), my delusion
(doubt), is destroyed through Your grace"" (Gita 18/73). -

""'Vedaisca sarvairahameva vedyah'—Here the term ‘Sarvaih’',
stands for the Vedas and the scriptures, which help a man, to -
acquire true knowledge of God, and enable him to realize Him.

Here the Lord explains, that Vedas aim to enable a striver, /
to realize God, rather than to acquire, mundane pleasures. There
is a description of the performance of actions for their fruits in
the Vedas, because most of the people perform actions, for their
fruits. Therefore, the Vedas, (being the mother of all beings) |
also nourish them. _ | |

It is verily He, who is to be known by all the Vedas, because
without knowing Him, knowledge is imperfect.* Arjuna had a keen
desire to know God. Therefore, the Lord declares that He, Who is
to be known by all the Vedas, and scriptures, is sitting before him. |

""Vedantakrt'—The Vedas, were created by Him (Gita 3/15; 17/23).

Therefore, He can explain the principles of the Vedas and can
reconcile the contradictions, that appear to exist, in them. So He

* Having studied the Vedas thoroughly the fool who does not know God
is merely the bearer of the load of the Vedas.

(Mahabharata, Santi. 318/50) So
"
1720,"1666 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter15
declares, that He is the real knower of Vedas, and can give correct
interpretation removing all doubts, pertaining to Vedas. -

""Vedavideva caham'—It is He, who knows the correct intention -
of Vedas, because these have been created by Him. :
Even scholars find themselves at their wits end, in giving
a right judgment, on contradictions, in the Vedas, (Gita 2/53). __

They can know Vedas, in the right perspective and be free from
contradictions, only by depending on God. : |

The Lord, in the first verse of this chapter declared, ""He
who knows this imperishable Pipala tree, is the knower of the — -
Vedas."" But here, He declares, that He is the knower of the Vedas. ~
It means, that the great soul who knows the reality about the _
world, becomes identified with God. The reality, about the world,
is that the world has no existence of its own, only God exists. ~
Having learned this fact, he renounces his assumed affinity, for
the world and dependence on it, and he realizes his real affinity
for God and depends on Him.

The Lord, has described His manifestations, in the different
forms, in four chapters—

In the seventh chapter from the eighth verse to the twelfth
verse, the Lord has mentioned His seventeen manifestations, by __
declaring that He is the cause of important objects of the universe.
Thus, He has proved His omnipresence, in different forms.

In the ninth chapter from the sixteenth verse to the nineteenth
verse, He, having described His thirty-seven manifestations in -
actions, sentiments and objects etc., in the form of effect and
cause, has explained His omnipresence, and all pervasiveness.

The tenth chapter is designated, as the Yoga of Divine
manifestation. In the fourth and the fifth verses, He has mentioned
twenty qualities, as His manifestation, while in the sixth verse,

He has mentioned His twenty-five manifestations, inthe form of = =
"
1721,"Verse 15] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1667 :

great persons. Then, from the twentieth verse to the thirty-ninth

verse, He has particularly mentioned, His eighty-two exceptional

manifestations. : :
In this fifteenth chapter from the twelfth to the fifteenth

verses, the Lord has mentioned His thirteen manifestations, in

order to show His glory.*
The purpose of describing His manifestation, in four chapters

is to make the striver, realize that all is God (Gita 7/19). Therefore,

while describing His manifestations, He has specially proved, _

His omnipresence as— |
""There is no other cause of this universe higher than Me"" (7/7). -
""I am existence and non-existence, O Arjuna"" (9/19).
""I am the source of all; from Me, everything moves"" (10/8). -
""There is no being, whether moving or unmoving, that can

exist without Me"" (10/39) 1e., all the beings, whether moving ~

or unmoving, are His manifestations. ° : -
Thus while concluding the description of His manifestation,

in this fifteenth chapter, He declares:— -
“I am seated in the hearts of all"" (15/15).
It means, that ail beings and objects exist, because of the

existence of God; these have no independent existence, of their own.
In the absence of light i.e., in darkness no object is visible.

When we see an object, first we see light, and then the object

1.e., every object is seen, within the light, but we instead of

having our eye on the light, have it on the object. Similarly,

we gain knowledge of all objects, actions and feelings etc., :

* The thirteen manifestations described in this chapter are as follows:—
(i) The light (splendour) in the sun (2) The light in the moon (3) The light

in the fire (4) The supporting energy of the earth (5) The nourishing power

of the moon (6) The gastric fire (7) He is lodged in hearts (8) Memory (9)

Knowledge (J0) Ratiocinative faculty (11) He Who is to be known by the

Vedas (12) The author of the Vedanta (13) The knower of the Vedas.
"
1722,"1668 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA | [Chapter15  ~
within the unique and permanent Light (Knowledge), Who its
the illuminator and base of all of them. Therefore, when we
behold worldly objects, first the illuminator of those objects
(God), is seen, but because of our attachment to the world we ~
do not perceive Him. | |

In fact, the world has no independent existence. But, it seems
to exist, because of our attachment to beings and objects, and
because of desire to derive pleasure out of them. As soon as,
this attachment for them and the desire to derive pleasure out of
them, are renounced, God's existence, will be realized. Therefore, ~
the Lord, while describing His manifestations, aims at explaining _
that a striver, should behold God in every being or object, he __
looks at, or thinks of, (Gita 10/41).

At present, people attach too much importance to riches, and) __
regard themselves as superior to others, because of their wealth.*

But in fact, wealth by itself cannot be used. It is the things bought
with that wealth, that are used. Thus a man, who attaches too’ _ -
much importance to wealth, cannot attach importance, to God.
Then, how can a burning desire for God-realization grow inhim?
Such a man, cannot even resolve, to realize God. He cannot even
understand, that life can run smoothly, without wealth.

As a businessman, during a transaction thinks in terms of money
only, so does a striver, having the aim of God-realization, behold —-
God only, in every object and activity etc. He comes to realize,
that there neither is, nor can be, any other entity besides God.

Arjuna, in the fourteenth chapter asked Lord Krsna, the method
of transcending the three modes of nature. It is attachment, to

~ these modes, which entangles a man. Therefore the Lord has

* The man who regards himself as superior or inferior to others because of
his wealth, degrades himself. A wealthy man becomes proud of his wealth and
pride is the root of demoniac endowment. All the evils and sins are bom of pride.
"
1723,", Verse 15] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1669 ""
mentioned his manifestations, in order to stress upon strivers
that He, is superior to all the modes of nature i1.e., to the world
and His glory, is greater than any other glory.

In order to explain His glory, the Lord (from the twelfth to /
the fifteenth verses of the chapter), describes that it is He, Who |
illumines the entire world; Who entering the earth supports all
beings; who nourishes all herbs and plants (corn etc.). Again it
is He, Who digests food, by becoming gastric fire, and it is He,

Who is the source of memory, knowledge and the ratiocinative
faculty. It means, that all the activities of the world from the .
beginning to the end, whether these are individual or social, are -
undertaken within Him, by His power only. A man, because of -
his egoism, becomes the doer of actions and thus gets himself

in bondage.

Appendix—Whatever the Lord said in the first verse of this
chapter, He concludes it in this verse.

In the preceding three verses the Lord described His divine -
glories in the form of His impact and activities but in this verse
He describes Himself. It means that in this verse there is His -
own description; “adityagata’ (residing in the Sun), ‘candragata’
(residing in the Moon), ‘agnigata’. (residing in the Fire) or
‘vaiSvanaragata’ (residing in the gastric fire)—this is not God’s
own description. Though at the root there is only one Reality .
(Tattva), there is difference only in the description.

The expression ‘mamaivarmso jivaloke’ proves that God is
‘ours’, while here the expression “sarvasya caharn hrdi sannivistah’
proves that God is ‘in the Self’. If we regard the Lord as ours,
then there will be spontaneous love for Him and if we accept /
Him ‘in the Self’, then there is no need to go anywhere else
to attain Him.

The term ‘apohanam’ means ‘apagata ohanam’ viz., removal
of doubt. The term ‘vedanta’ means the end of the Vedas viz.,
the gist of the Vedas—‘ubhayorapi drsto’ntah’ (Gita 2/16).
"
1724,"1670 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA _ [Chapter 15 |
The Lord declares that the Vedas are-several but out all of
them, it is only He Who is to be known and He is also their
knower. It means that only He is all.

Link:—The Lord, in this chapter from the first verse. to the
fifteenth verse (in three sub-topics), has described the tree of creation
1.e., the world, the embodied soul and God, in detail. While
concluding the topic, He in the next two verses, describes them
respectively in explicit words as Ksara, Aksara and Purusottama.

There are two kinds of Purusas in the world, the perishable
(Ksara) and the imperishable (Aksara). All bodies of beings -
are said to be perishable and the unchanging Jivatma is called
imperishable. 16 _ | | 7
Comment:—
‘Dvavimau purusau loke ksaraScadksara eva ca'—Here, the
term ‘Loke’, stands for the entire world. In the seventh verse of
this chapter the term ‘Jivaloke', also stands for the world. ""
The world is divided into two aspects (categories), the
perishable objects, such as the body etc., (the insentient), and
the imperishable soul (the sentient), which resides in the body. It
is because of the soul, that the life-breath and the body function.
As soon as, life-breath within the soul, leaves the body, it stops
functioning, and it starts to rot. People burn a dead body, because
it is useful, only so long as, the soul resides in it. It means that
it is the soul, rather than the body, which is significant.
All the objects, such as the body etc., made of the five gross
elements—earth, water, fire, air and ether, are insentierit and
"
1725,"Verse 16] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI _ 1671 ”
perishable. The physical body, has its identity with physical world;
the subtle body consisting of the ten senses, five vital airs; the
mind and the intellect (these seventeen), has its identity with the
subtle world, while the causal body (nature, impressions of the ;
actions, ignorance), has its identity with causal world (nature).
They are called 'Ksara', because they are perishable.
In fact, there is nothing as individual; but when a person
regards a little portion of the world, as his own, he says that it
is individual. The body .and other objects, seem different from
the world, because of a man’s attachment, a sense of mineness to =
them, otherwise they are one, and the same. In fact, all objects ~
and actions, belong only to Nature.* Therefore, all actions with -
the physical, subtle and causal bodies, are to be performed for a
the welfare of the world only, not for one's own self.
The term ‘Aksarah’, stands for the imperishable soul, which
never undergoes any modification.t Nature is insentient, (matter),
while the soul, being a fragment of God, is sentient. ,
 * Tf a striver regards the objects and actions as the world's, it means he
follows the path of action; if he regards them as Nature's, he follows the path -
of knowledge; if he regards them as God's, it means he follows the path of
devotion. They may be of the world or of Nature, or of God, in no case they
are not one's own.
tIn the Gita the perishable (Ksara), the imperishable (Aksara) and the |
Supreme Person (Purusottama) have been described by different names as follows:
Chapter-Verse Ksara (perishable) Aksara (imperishable) Purusottama
7/4—6 Apara prakrti (lower Para prakrti (higher Aham (1)

. Yoni (womb) Bija (seed) (father)
"
1726,"1672 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 15
| The term 'Ksarah’, used in the verse stands for the Pipala tree
in the form of the world, which should be cut, as is mentioned
in the third verse, while 'Aksarah’ is the soul, a fragment of God, |
as is described in the seventh verse. | /

In Gita, for each of the Ksara, Aksara and Purusottama,
different words belonging to the three genders, have been used
on different occasion. It means, that Nature, the soul, and God
are neither female, nor male nor a hermaphrodite. They are free
from the restrictions of gender.*

In order to, show the superiority of 'Purusottama’ (the Supreme -
Person), the Lord has used, for both 'Ksara' (perishable) and -
Aksara (imperishable), the term 'Purusa’ (person). : :

'Ksarah sarvani bhitani'—Here, the term 'Ksara’, stands for
a tree in the form of universe, as described at the beginning of 8
the universe, which is without end, or origin or foundation, and
which according to the Lord, should be cut with a strong axe,
of non-attachment. |

Here the term ‘Bhutani’, stands for all the three physical,
subtle and causal bodies, because, bodies rather than the soul, 7
are perishable.

'Kiitastho'ksara ucyate'— The Lord, here has called the soul
‘Aksara'’ (imperishable), while in the seventh verse, He called It,

His eternal fragment. |

*In the Gita the perishable (Ksara), the imperishable (Aksara) and the
Supreme Person (Purusottama) have been used in all the three genders. For
example— . |

(1) Ksara— _ Kgarah (15/16)— masculine gender |

Apara (7/5)—feminine gender
Mahadbrahma (14/3-4)—neuter gender
(2) Aksara— Jivabhiitah (15/7)—masculine gender
| Jivabhutam (7/5)—— feminine gender
Adhyatmam (8/3)— neuter gender |
(3).Purusottama— —_—- Bharta (9/18)—masculine gender |
. Gatih (9/18) —feminine gender
Saranam (9/18) —neuter gender
"
1727,"Verse 16} SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI | 1673

The soul, may acquire anybody or may go to any world,
but ever remains uniform, without undergoing any modifications
(Gita 8/19; 13/31). Therefore, It has been called 'Kitastha’, |
(immutable or unchanging), ©... - .. .

In the Gita, both.God and the soul, have been described as
possessing the same characteristics. God (in 12/3) has been called
‘Kiitastha’ (unchanging) and (in 8/4) 'Aksara' (imperishable), while
here, the soul has been described as 'Kutastha' (unchanging), and
‘Aksara’ (imperishable). Both of these have identity in essence
and character. |

- The soul, is ever-uniform and according to non-dualistic :
principle, is the same as God, but becomes the embodied soul
by identifying Itself with Nature, and its evolute body etc.

Appendix—In the sixth verse and from the twelfth verse to -
the fifteenth verse the Lord described the divine entity that has its
independent existence, while the earthly entity has no independent
existence. The earthly entity seems to exist because of the divine
entity. The earthly entity is illumined by the unearthly (divine)
entity only. Whatever influence is perceived in the worldly entity,
that is all of the divine one. Now in the sixteenth verse the Lord -
by the term ‘loke’ describes the ‘worldly entity’. |

_ The universe (perishable) and the soul (imperishable)—both
are ‘laukika’ (worldly)—‘dvavimau purusau loke ksarascaksara

eva ca’, and God is different from the two and is singular .
(unique) viz., is ‘alaukika’ (divine)——‘uttamah purusastvanyah’
(Gita 15/17). Karmayoga and Jiianayoga—these two paths are
also worldly —‘loke’ smindvividhanistha’ ...........(Gita 3/3). One who

attaches importance to the perishable, should practise Karmayoga .
while he who attaches importance to the imperishable (soul)
_ should practise Jiianayoga but Bhaktiyoga is ‘alaukika’ (unworldly)
(divine) which pertains to God. The ‘apara prakrti’ described in
the seventh chapter has been called here ‘ksara’, while the ‘para
prakrti’ described in the seventh chapter has been named ‘aksara’.

But, other than these (Ksara and Aksara), is the Supreme

entering the three worlds sustains all beings. 17
- Comment:— : } ,

‘Uttamah purusastvanyah'—The Lord, having described -
two kinds of persons, the perishable and the imperishable, now -
mentions, that other than these, is the Supreme Person.* |

Here the term 'Anyah' (other), has been used for God, in order -
to explain, that He 1s not only different, from the imperishable
soul, but also possesses a unique character. So the Lord, in the
eighteenth verse, declares that He transcends the perishable, and
is even higher, than the imperishable. The soul, in spite of being
a fragment of God, is attracted towards the perishable. So God, -
has been called unique, and other than the soul. |

'Paramatmetyudahrtah'—The term ‘Paramatma, stands for
the Supreme Person, and also denotes, attributeless God, the
Supreme Soul, the Soul, of all beings. In this verse, both the .
term 'Paramatma’, and ‘[svara’, have been used, which means
that God_ without attributes, or with attributes, is one and the
same, 'Purusottama’. :

* (1) Brahma (the Absolute) is the Supreme Imperishable Person, superior
to Brahma, the creator; unrevealed, limitless in whom both knowledge and
ignorance are established. The perishable matter is known as ignorance while
the imperishable soul is known as knowledge. The Supreme Lord Who controls
both knowledge and ignorance is different from both of them and is totally
unique (Svetasvataropanisad 5/1). |

(2) Nature is perishable while the soul, the embodiment of nectar Which
enjoys Nature is imperishable. The Lord controls these two (the perishable and
the imperishable) (Svetasvataropanisad 1/10). oe
"
1729,"Verse 17] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1675 :

""Yo lokatrayamavisya bibhartyavyaya isvarah'—That Supreme
Person permeates (enters), the three worlds equally.

Here the term 'Bibharti', means that God sustains all beings, |
but the soul by an error, having assumed Its affinity for the world .
i.e., people etc., as their own, takes responsibility upon itself that |
It sustains beings, and then It has to suffer in vain.*¥ =

. The Lord is called ‘Avyayah'. (a + vyayah = no spending or

- expenditure), because in spite of sustaining, all the world He incurs
no expenditure; He has no shortage. He ever remains, uniform.
The term ‘ISvarah', stands for God with attributes, and it |
means, the controller. _ a a .

Though parents, sustain or nourish a child, yet the child, does _
not know this fact. Similarly, God nourishes all beings, yet an |
ignorant person (not having an eye on God), does not realize,
this fact. But a devotee, who has taken refuge in Him, knows -
it very well, that only God sustains, all beings.

As far as sustenance of beings is concerned, God is impartial -
to a devotee and non-devotee, the sinner and the virtuous, the
believer and the non-believer, etc., equally.+ It is very well,
known to all, that in the universe created by God, the sun equally
provides heat and light to all beings, the earth provides space -
to all beings, the gastric fire, equally digests food of all beings,

* The question of sustenance arises only in the path of devotion rather
than in the path of knowledge because in the former path a man (the soul) is
regarded as different from God. Therefore, this topic should be regarded as .
the topic of devotion. 7 ,

+ God showers. His grace equally on all beings without any distinction
of caste, form, riches and age of beings and without thinking whether they
deserve praise or blame.

This great cloud in the form of the innerself is the enjoyer of the inner
feelings. Does a cloud while providing rain think whether the receiver is the
tree Mimosa catechu or Michelia champacca (Prabodhasudhakara 252-253)?
"
1730,"1676 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 15 .
air is equally available to all beings, for breath, food and water
satisfy all beings equally and so on.
Appendix—The Lord calls the Supreme Soul as other because
the perishable (world) and the imperishable (soul)—both are laukika .
(worldly) but ‘Purusottama’ (the Supreme Person) is different
from the two and is unique viz., unworldly (divine). Therefore |
the Supreme Soul (God) is not the subject to be reflected upon |
but is the subject of faith and belief. In believing the existence of
God: devotees, saints, exalted souls, the Vedas and the scriptures :
are the authority. The term ‘anya’ has been explained by the
Lord in the next verse. :
“Yo lokatrayamavisya.........— In this expression there is the |
idea (gist) of the topic described from the twelfth to the fifteenth
verses. A man has to perform his duty in the human world but 7
the Lord’s field of activities comprises all the three worlds. In
fact the Lord has no duty to discharge, yet He is engaged in ;
activities for the welfare of all beings (Gita 3/22—24).
Link:—The Lord having described His identity, with the
Supreme Person, now discloses His secret, when He declares:—
FAA ASSAY «=| ALTA: | |
STATS Stes Ae ST UiMIa: THAT: ULSI
yasmatksaramatito'hamaksaradapi cottamah
ato'smi loke vede ca _ prathitah purusottamah |
As I transcend the perishable and am above the imperishable,
I am declared as Purusottama (Supreme Person) in the world, as
well as in the Vedas. 18
Comment:— :
""Yasmatksaramatito'ham'—The Lord, declares, that the
perishable (Nature) is kaleidoscopic, while He remains the same,
"
1731,"Verse 18] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1677 -
without undergoing any modifications. So, He transcends the
perishable. |

Senses are superior to a body, superior to the senses, is
mind, superior to the mind, is intellect (Gita 3/42). In spite of
the superiority, of one to the other, the body, senses, mind and -
the intellect are insentient, and belong to the same class. But,
God, transcends all of them, as He is sentient, while all of them,
are insentient.

‘Aksaradapi cottamah'—Though, being a fragment of God,
the soul, (the imperishable) has Its identity with God, yet here =
the Lord, declares that He is superior even to the soul. How? -
There are few reasons: (1) The soul in spite of being a fragment -
of God, assumes Its affinity for the perishable Nature (Gita 15/7) |
and is deluded by modes of Nature, while God (being beyond
Nature) never gets deluded, (Gita 7/13), (2) God, subduing His -
own Nature, manifests Himself (incarnates), (Gita 4/6) while the
embodied soul, being under compulsion by Nature, streams forth /
into being (Gita 8/19), (3) God ever remains untainted (Gita
4/14; 9/9), while the embodied soul, has to attain the state of ;
untaintedness (Gita 4/18; 7/14).

When the Lord declares, that He transcends the perishable,
and is even higher, than the imperishable, He also means to
mention, that the perishable and the imperishable, are also |
different. Had they not been different, the Lord would have
declared, ""I transcend the perishable and the imperishable, or I
am higher than the perishable and the imperishable."" It proves
that the imperishable, also transcends the perishable, and is higher |
than it, in the same way as God, transcends the perishable and -
is higher than, the imperishable.

‘Ato'smi loke vede ca prathitah purusottamah'—Here the
term 'Loke’, stand for scripture, in which God is celebrated as
‘Purusottama’, (Supreme Person). a

The term ‘Veda’, means pure knowledge, which is
"
1732,"1678 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 15
beginningless. The same knowledge was revealed serially, in
the form of the Vedas, such as the Rk and the Yajuh etc. In the
Vedas, God has been declared as 'Purusottama’. ee, |

_. The Lord, in the preceding verse, declared,.""Other than the
perishable and the imperishable, is the Supreme Person."" So
here He discloses the secret, that He is the Supreme Person,
celebrated as ‘Purusottama. sits Poe

(1) The entire universe is perishable, while the soul, the .

fragment of God, is imperishable. Though the imperishable ;
transcends the perishable, and is higher than it, yet the former :
errs, by assuming its affinity, for the latter. The body like
running water of a river, is flowing continuously, while the -
soul like a fixed rock, ever remains immovable and detached.
A body of childhood, changes into a body of boyhood, but 'T,
ever remains the same. But we cannot say which day, childhood
ended and boyhood, commenced. Had the imperishable, been
kaleidoscopic and perishable, there would have been no question
of its repeated birth and death. But in spite of, being uniform
and imperishable, it assumes Its affinity for the kaleidoscopic
and the perishable, and so, It is repeatedly born and dies. In
order to, get rid of this birth and death, the perishable (body
etc., should be used in rendering service to the world, to such
an extent, that a body, becomes manure in the world-garden.
God has bestowed upon a man, objects such as, human body
etc., to render selfless service to others, rather than to lay claim |
on them. Therefore, it is the duty of a man, to use them in
the service of others. To regard them as his own, is a blunder.
(2) In the fifteenth chapter, the Lord first described the perishable
Pipala tree in the form of a world. Then He inspired, Arjuna to cut
off this tree and take refuge, in the Supreme Person. Afterwards .
He described the soul and mentioned It, as His fragment. Then
"
1733,"Verse 18] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1679
(from the twelfth verse to the fifteenth verse) He explained, that
the light (splendour) in the sun, the moon, and the fire, is His;
and permeating the earth, He supports all beings and having -
become gastric fire, He digests food; He is seated in the hearts .
of all; He*is the source of memory, knowledge and ratiocinative
faculty; He is to be known by the Vedas; He is the author of
the Vedanta, and knower of the Vedas. Having mentioned His
supreme power, the Lord in this verse, reveals the secret of
secrets, that He, Lord Krsna, sitting before him, is the Supreme |
Person known as Purusottama. 7 Oo .

Arjuna, like a father who addresses his son of his secret treasure,
or like an officer who discloses his identity to a person who is |

Appendix—The Lord has used the term ‘yasmat’ (because)
here in order to draw attention of the strivers towards His
unworldliness (divinity). :
_, ‘AkKsaradapi cottamah’—the term ‘imperishable’ has been
used for both the Self and Brahma-—‘aksararh brahma paramam’ -
(Gita 8/3). This term always stands for the sentient, it never
stands for the insentient. | | | 7
The perishable (world) and the imperishable (soul) have no
independent existence but God has His independent existence. |
The perishable and the imperishable—both abide in God. But the
imperishable (soul), being attached to the perishable, becomes
dependent on the latter—‘yayedam dharyate jagat’ (Gita 7/5). God
naturally remains detached, He does not become dependent on the -
perishable—‘yasmatksaramatito’ ham’. Therefore God is superior
even to the imperishable (soul). If the man (soul) instead of being
attached to the world, gets attached to God, he will become one
with God—‘jiianitvatmaiva me matam’ (Gita 7/18). |

Comment:— : a
""Yo mamevamasammidhah'—The soul, is an eternal fragment
of God. When It realizes Its real affinity for God, it means, that
It is, undeluded. — So : |
Delusion is a stumbling block, to the real knowledge of
the world, or of God. The reality, about a thing can be known,
only when a man has neither attachment nor aversion, to it. This
attachment or aversion, is delusion. | |
_ When a man knows the world in reality, he (the self) realizes
his identity with God, and when he knows the reality about
God, he realizes, that he (the self), is different from the world.
It means that he renounces his assumed affinity for the world,
having known the reality about. the world, and realizes his real
affinity for God, having known the reality about God.
A man, can possess unswerving devotion only, when he
does not assume his affinity for the world.

delusion, knows that God, is the Highest (Supreme) Person.
He, who regarding the Supreme. Person as the Supreme
Lord Who, transcends the perishable, has an inclination to Him
and considers Him as his own, he knows Him, really as the |
Supreme Person.
: He, who comes to know that the whole power or influence
or splendour, that is either seen or heard in the world, is God's,
his attraction towards the world totally perishes. If there is the
least attraction for the world, it means, that he has not firmly .
admitted the existence of God, or His power.
‘Sa sarvavidbhajati mam sarvabhavena bharata'—For him, -
who knows God as the Supreme Person, having no doubt or |
confusion, nothing remains to be known, and so the Lord calls
him, the knower of all.* _ :
Nothing remains to be known for the person, who has known
God, even if he is illiterate or less educated.
Such a person, who knows the Supreme Person, is the knower
of all and he worships God, with all his being. -
When a person, knows that God transcends the perishable,
his mind (attachment) deviates from the world, and is concentrated
on God. When he knows Him higher than the imperishable, his
intellect (faith), is absorbed in God.T |
Then God is worshipped, through each of his inclinations
and actions. Thus worship to God, with all being is ‘unswerving
devotion.’ : oe
So long as a man, is attached to mundane objects, such as |
the body, senses, mind and intellect etc., he cannot worship God
with all his being, because a man has an automatic inclination,
*O gentleman! He who knows God Who is imperishable, is omniscient
and such a person enters the Supreme Lord (PraSnopanisad 4/11).
TThe mind is concentrated on the object or topic it is attached to and
the intellect gets absorbed in it if there is faith (belief), - =~

1736,"1682 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter.15 -
to an object, he is attached to. _ a

_. When.a striver, accepts the fact 'I am God's and only God
is mine’, God .is automatically. worshipped by. him, with all his
being. Then all the activities (sleeping, waking, speaking, walking, -
eating and drinking etc.,) are undertaken by him, in order to
please God, rather than for himself.

As ‘knowing’ plays an important role in the path of
knowledge, so does assumption, play an important role in the
path of devotion. Firm assumption, free from doubt, 1s ‘knowing’ .
(knowledge), in the path of devotion. When a devotee, believes ;
that God is the Supreme Person, he worships Him with all his -
being, (Gita 10/8). | _

When a person holds that God, is the Supreme Person, he
becomes a knower of all; then there is no doubt, that the person -
who worships God, with all his being, will know Him, as the
Supreme Person. : .

Appendix—‘ Yo mamevamasammudho janati purusottamam’—

He, who knows God is really undeluded (Gita 10/3) but he
who does not know God is deluded—‘avajananti math -
mudhah’ (Gita 9/11). | oo

‘Sa sarvavidbhajatti marn sarvabhavena bharata’—The
perishable and the imperishable—both are fragments of the entire |
form of God, therefore he who is the knower of these two, is not |
the knower of all (omniscient). But the person who knows the
Supreme Person, Who transcends the perishable and is superior
to the imperishable, is the knower of all viz., is the knower of ,
the entire form of God. Such an omniscient devotee remains
engaged in God in everyway by doing different duties—‘sarvatha
vartamano’ pi sa yogi mayi vartate’ (Gita 6/31); because from his
view-point there is no other entity at all besides God.

In the Gita, the term ‘sarvavit’ (knower of all) has been
used only for a devotee. A devotee knows the entire viz.,
the worldly and the unworldly (divine)—both, therefore he is
"
1737,"Verse 20] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI | 1683
‘sarvavit’. Within the worldly, the unworldly: (divine) cannot
be included but. within the unworldly, the worldly is included.
Therefore the knower of the attributeless God (Imperishable)
is not the knower of all but the devotee who knows the entire oO
form of God is the knower of all.

Link:—According to the principle of Arundhati (moving from
the gross to the subtle) the Lord, first described the perishable,

'‘Anagha'—Arjuna has been called sinless, as he is free from a :
carping (cavilling) spirit. Cavilling is a sin, which defiles the mind.
He who is free from the cavilling spirit deserves devotion.
A secret, is disclosed only to a person, who is free from
a cavilling spirit.* If the secret is disclosed to the person who -
cavils, it may have a contrary effect on him, i.e., he may find
fault even in the speaker that the latter eulogises himself and
* Tn the first verse of the ninth chapter Lord Krsna promised Arjuna that
He would declare to him who did not cavil the greatest secret. Here in the
fifteenth chapter also the most secret doctrine has been taught by the Lord. So

deludes others. Thus a man, who finds fault may have a fall.
A man cavils, because of his pride. Actually a man suffers
from the defect, he is proud of. So he starts seeing that defect,
in others. As soon as, a man is proud of his virtue, he starts -
finding fault with others, and when he finds faults with others,
he is proud of his virtues.
If the Lord calls Himself the Supreme: Person, before a man
who cavils, he will not believe Him. He will rather think, that
He is boastful ‘and so He, is praising Himself. 2
Those who cavil at God have a fall. Therefore God and :
saints, do not disclose secrets to those who cavil, and who are :
without faith (Gita 18/67). In fact profound secrets are not passed
on to those, who cavil. . -
Arjuna has been addressed as 'Anagha’, because the most
profound secret has been revealed before him who is upright
and free from cavilling spirit.
‘Iti guhyatamam sastramidam'—The expression ‘Iti, 1dam'
(thus, His), denotes the conclusion of the topic of, the perishable, -
the imperishable and the Supreme Person, described, from the
first to the nineteenth verses of the fifteenth chapter, after
describing unswerving devotion, in the twenty-sixth verse of
the fourteenth chapter. |
In this chapter Lord Krsna, having described the perishable
(world) and the imperishable (soul), explained His splendour;
power and influence, (from the twelfth to the fifteenth verses). :
Then He disclosed the secret that He is the Supreme Person, Who -
transcends the perishable and is higher, than the imperishable.
God incarnates, like an actor in a play. He plays the role of
a human being, in such a way that ignorant people do not know
Him (Gita 7/24). They think that He is a common mortal, like other
ordinary human beings, who is born on account of actions, of the
previous birth. Generally, an actor in a play does not disclose his ee
"
1739,"Verse 20} SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1685 7
identity. But the Lord in this chapter (in the eighteenth verse), |
has disclosed His identity by declaring that He is the Supreme
Person. Therefore, the chapter has been called, the most secret.
In the 'Sastra’ generally, there is description of the world, the soul -
and God (the Supreme Person). As there is a description of all these
three in the fifteenth chapter, this chapter has been called 'Sastra.' |
Though the Gita, is the gist of all the ‘Sastras', ie., she
scriptures, only this chapter, has been called 'Sastra' (the scripture).
As in this chapter, there is, preeminently the description of /
'Purusottama' (the Supreme Person), this chapter has been called
the most secret scripture. In this chapter, there is an account of -
six methods of knowing Him:—
(1) To know the reality, about the world (Verse 1).
(2) To take refuge in God, having renounced the assumed ~
affinity for the world (Verse 4). |
(3) To perceive Him, as established in the self (Verse 11). :
_ (4) To know Him, through the study of Vedas (Verse 15).
(5) To worship Him, by all one's being (heart), by regarding -
Him as the Supreme Person (Verse 19).
(6) To know the essence, of the whole chapter (Verse 20).
It is appropriate to call this chapter 'SAstra', because’ easy 7
methods, for God-realization, have been described in this chapter. ""
""Maya uktam'—The Lord declares, that this most secret
teachings has been taught out of His special grace by Him,
the Supreme Person, Who is the illuminator and base of the
entire world, Who is seated in the hearts of all, Who is to be -
known by the Vedas and Who is higher, than the perishable
and the imperishable. No one, can describe Him, in the way He
has described Himself, because first anyone can know Him by
His special grace only, and then he can describe Him to some
extent, while, He can give a real description of Himself, as His
knowledge is perfect. : |
"
1740,"1686 | SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 15

In fact, no one else, except God can know Him perfectly,

(Gita. 10/2, 15). In the thirty-ninth verse of the sixth chapter,

Arjuna said to Lord Krsna, ""No one else than Thyself, can dispel

my doubt.” Here the Lord, seems to declare, that there. is no ‘
. question of doubt, about the, teaching which He has taught to him.

""Etadbuddhva buddhimansyatkrtakrtyaSca bharata'—In the
whole of this chapter, the Lord has described the reality about
the world, the nature of the soul. and the. matchless influence,
and secrecy about Himself. So the term ‘Etat’, denotes all this .
(or specially what has been described in the nineteenth verse).
He, who knows this most secret, teaching, is wise 1.e., for him -
nothing remains to be known, because he has known the Supreme
Person, Who is worth knowing.

Having known God, a man's delusion is destroyed. Without -
knowing Him, even having known, all arts, scripts, sciences and
languages etc., a man remains deluded, because all mundane
knowledge is perishable and imperfect. All arise from God. :
So how can they illumine their source, God? Even if a person
ignorant of worldly knowledge as described above, realizes God, -
then he 1s really, a man of knowledge. |

The devotee, who is undeluded, who worships Him, with
all his being, and who is a knower of all, as described, in the
nineteenth verse, has been called wise. ""

Here, the term ‘Ca’ denotes, that nothing remains to be gained
(acquired) by the devotee who worships God with all his being
l.e., with unswerving devotion, as described in the preceding
verse. ""There is no gain, equal to devotion"" (Manasa 7/112/4). |
Therefore, nothing remains to be gained by a devotee, who has
attained devotion. |
_ For him who knows God, either through the path of action, of
knowledge or of devotion, nothing remains to be done, to be known
and to be gained by him, and his human life truly is successful.

Appendix—The Lord in this chapter has revealed Himself in the
"
1741,"Verse 20] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1687 -
form of the Supreme Person viz., in His divine entire form, therefore -
this chapter has been called the most’ secret Sastra (scripture).
Nothing remains to be done by a man by Karmayoga, nothing
remains to be known by Jnanayoga and nothing remains to be |
attained by Bhaktiyoga. I have to do nothing for myself—having
realized this fact, nothing remains to be done for a man. The body |
is not mine, I have no possession over it and I have no connection
with it—having realized this fact, nothing remains to be known to
a man. I need nothing—having realized this fact, nothing remains
to be attained by a man. The term ‘buddhiman’ used in the verse :
denotes the notion that the striver has known what was to be known. -
In the preceding verse the expression ‘sa sarvavidbhajati mar > -
sarvabhavena bharata’ denotes that he has attained the attainable
viz., nothing remains to be attained by him. In this verse by the
term ‘ca’ also the additional meaning—‘nothing remains to be -
attained by him’ can be taken. The worldly perishable and the
imperishable—both have already been gained, therefore only the -
unworldly—God is to be attained. This verse gives the idea that
a devotee attains the aim which is attained both by Jhanayoga
and Karmayoga viz., nothing remains to be known to him and -
also nothing remains to be done by him (Gita 7/29-30, 10/10-11).

| INTRODUCTION
Lord Krsna, in the fifteenth verse of the’ seventh chapter,
explained in brief, the traits of a person possessing the demoniac
nature, by declaring that those evil-doers who are foolish and .
who have embraced the demoniac ‘nature, do not, worship Him.
In the sixteenth verse, He explained in brief that those possessing -
divine nature such virtuous men, worship Him. In the beginning |
of the eighth chapter, Arjuna put seven question based on the
last two verses of the seventh chapter. The Lord answered those ~
questions, in the whole of eighth chapter.
The Lord at the beginning of the seventh chapter, had ;
promised that He would unfold to him the knowledge, together _
with realization. So He started the ninth chapter. In the twelfth
verse of the ninth chapter, He explains that senseless persons, ;
with vain hopes, futile actions and fruitless knowledge, embrace
a nature which is demoniac, while in the thirteenth verse He
declared that great souls, who know Him as the prime cause
of creation and worship Him, constantly with undivided mind,
possess a divine nature. Then the Lord, upto the eleventh verse
of the tenth chapter, described the topic of knowledge and _
of realization. oe | |
After the eleventh verse of the tenth chapter, the Lord should
have described the divine and demoniac natures in detail, but
Arjuna having been influenced by His grace, offered praises
to Him and prayed to Him to tell him of His divine glories.
While explaining His divine glories, the Lord in the last verse
of the tenth chapter declared, ""What need is there, O Arjuna,
for detailed knowledge? I stand supporting the whole universe
"
1744,"1690 | SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter16
with a single fragment of Myself."" So Arjuna, at the beginning
of the eleventh chapter, out of curiosity prayed to the Lord, to
reveal to him, that cosmic form. __ | : |
Having revealed to Arjuna His cosmic form, the Lord in :
the fifty-fourth and the fifty-fifth verses of the eleventh chapter,
explained the merits of exclusive devotion, and the traits of such
a devotee. So, in the first verse of the twelfth chapter, Arjuna
inquired ""Who are considered to be superior, those who are |
properly engaged in Your devotional service, or those who -
worship the Imperishable and the Unmanifested?"" Therefore, .
the Lord, in the twelfth chapter, described the devotees, who -
are properly engaged in His devotional service, and described the .
attributeless, supreme Brahma, in the thirteenth chapter and upto
the twentieth verse of the fourteenth chapter. In the twenty-first ~ )
verse of the fourteenth chapter, Arjuna asked, “What are the
marks of him, who has risen above the three gunas (modes)?
What is his conduct like? How does he transcend the three
modes?"" In response to his questions, the Lord explained about
exclusive devotion, the means to rise above the three modes 1.e., -
He gave a hint of divine nature, through exclusive devotion and
of demoniac nature, through adulterated devotion. He started
the fifteenth chapter, in order to explain how to develop that
exclusive devotion. |
In the third verse of the fifteenth chapter, there is a mention
of cutting down Pipala tree with a weapon of detachment (1.e.,
renunciation of attachment) which is a mark of divine nature.
In the fourth verse, there is description of divine nature‘in the :
expression ""I seek. refuge, in the Primal Person."" It means, that
those who do not seek refuge in Him, are of demoniac nature. In
the nineteenth verse, there is a description of divine nature, when
the Lord declares,""The undeluded person who thus knows. Me as
Supreme Person, worships Me with his whole being.” It means,
that those who do not worship Him, are of demoniac nature.
"
1745,"Verse 1] - SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1691 ;
Thus, Lord Krsna, could not get an opportunity to explain |
in greater detail, the divine and demoniac natures, because
Arjuna went on putting questions. Now He gets an opportunity
to explain the divine and demoniac natures in detail, so He
starts the topic. SO ce :

Comment:— | - ,
[The Lord, in the nineteenth verse of the fifteenth chapter, -
declared, ""The undeluded person, who thus knows Me as the
Supreme Person, worships Me with his whole being.” It means,
that he worships the Lord, with exclusive devotion. Thus when
a devotee has only the aim of God-realization, divine nature is
revealed in him, naturally. Therefore, the Lord in the first three
verses, describes divine nature pertaining to sentiment, conduct
and glory.]
‘Abhayam'*— Nervous excitement, caused by the thought of
losing something which is agreeable, and meeting with something,
which is undesirable, is called fear. Total absence of this sort
of fear, is fearlessness. |
* The Lord mentions fearlessness as the first quality because he who
worships the Lord with his whole being by taking refuge in Him becomes
totally fearless (Valmiki Ramayana 6/18/33).
"
1746,"1692 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 16 -

Fear can be of two types—(1) External (2) Internal.

(1) External:— (a) A man is afraid of thieves, robbers, lions,
and ‘snakes etc., because he identifies himself with his body. But
when he realizes, that he is different from the perishable body, ;
he has no fear. | |

Fear caused in giving up bad habits, of smoking and
drinking and leaving the company of friends addicted to vice, |
is because of one's own cowardly nature. This fear, is removed
by abandoning cowardice.

(b) A person is afraid, lest he should act against the will of
parents, teachers and saints and against the ordinance of scriptures. -
In reality, this is no fear. This fear, leads to fearlessness. Actually
this sort of fear, is desirable for a striver, because it leads him |
to spiritual progress. _ -

(2) Internal:— (a) When a man, wants to perform forbidden
actions, which involve sin, injustice and atrocity etc., he is full /
of fear. He performs such evil deeds, so long as, he assumes his
affinity with the body, and wants to maintain the body and to
gain honour, pleasure and prosperity etc.* But, when he realizes, ;
that the only aim of human life is God-realizationT he is freed
from evil deeds, and forbidden actions, and he becomes totally
free, from fear.

(b) When a man is engaged in evil deeds, he is full of fear. |
For example, human beings, gods, demigods and devils, were
afraid of Ravana but when he abducted Sita, he was filled with

* Jn mundane pleasures there is fear of diseases, in high family there is -
fear of downfall, in riches there is fear of the king, in honour there is fear of
destitution, in power there is fear of enemy, in beauty there is fear of agedness,
in the scriptures there is fear of debate, in virtues there is fear of evil persons
and in the body there is fear of death. Thus all the worldly things are full of fear,
it is only dispassion which is free from fear (BhartrharivairagyasSatakam).

+t The aim of human life is decided before this human life is bestowed
upon us. We have to realize that aim, rather than to decide it. |
"
1747,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1693 -
fear. Similarly, there was no effect of the sound of the musical :
instruments, such as conchs etc., of the eleven Aksauhini army,

of the Kauravas on. the Pandavas army (Gita 1/13), but, when |
the musical instruments of the seven Aksauhini army of the

Pandavas blared forth, their sound rent the hearts of the Kaurava -
army (Gita 1/19). It means, that the hearts of those who commit

sins, and do injustice, become weak and so they are filled with

fear. But, when a person having given up injustice etc., purifies

his feelings and conduct, his fear disappears.

(c) So long as a human being, does not do, what is worth .
doing, does not know, what is worth knowing, and does not ;
gain, what is worth gaining, he cannot be totally fearless, fear =
subsists in him.

The more, a striver believes in God and the more, he depends -
on Him, the more fearless, he becomes. He thinks, that he being _
a fragment of the Lord, is imperishable, and so there is nothing to
be afraid of, while the bodies and the worldly objects are decaying
and perishing every moment. By having this discrimination, fear
perishes and a striver, becomes totally fearless.

By accepting affinity for the Lord, a person, has no attachment -
to the body and family etc. Having become freed from attachment,

a man is not afraid of death, and he becomes fearless.

'Sattvasamsuddhih'— Purity of mind, or purity of heart is |
‘Sattvasarnsuddhi’. When a person is detached from the world :
and is attached to the Lord, his heart is purified. As soon as, he |
decides the. aim of his life as God-realization, his heart becomes
pure, because, the aim of attainment of perishable things, causes
impurity in the form of sin, distraction and obscurity, (ignorance). |
In the scriptures, actions without desire for their fruit, worship :
and knowledge respectively, have been said to be, the means
to do away with this threefold impurity. The best means, to
purify the heart or the mind, is that it should not be regarded,
as one's own.

In order to, do away with one's sins, there is no need for
"
1748,"1694 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter16 —
expiation. A striver, should follow, the spiritual path zealously
and promptly. By doing so, his sins will perish and his heart,
will become pure. . OO oo
A striver, has a notion that spiritual activities such as devotion _
and adoration etc., are different from professions, such as business,
etc., viz., these are two different divisions. He believes, that-foul
means, such as falsehood and fraud etc., have to be adopted in
practical life, in business etc. This sort of attitude makes the
heart very impure. So a striver, does not advance in the spiritual
sphere quickly. Therefore a striver, should be cautious, that he -
does not incur any sin. :
When a crime is committed by an error, a striver, holds
himself responsible, for it. So his heart, becomes impure. He
should determine, never to commit that error again. Similarly, _
he holds other persons responsible, for doing evil to him. He
should forgive those persons voluntarily, and should pray to
God to forgive them, because he had received the fruit of his
past actions through them, those persons have become only an
instrument. By doing so, the heart or the mind, is purified. -
' Jnanayogavyavasthitih'—It is inevitable for a striver, to be
fixed in Yoga, in order to have true knowledge of God, whether
He is endowed with attributes or He is without attribute. Yoga,
means equanimity (evenness of mind), in gain and loss, honour
and dishonour, praise and blame etc. Oo |
'‘Danam’— 'Dana’ (charity), consists in giving away (so-called)
one's own things in a disinterested manner, as a matter of duty to
others, according to place, time and circumstances etc. A piece
of land, a cow, a piece of gold, grain and a piece of cloth, can |
be offered as charity. Out of these the foremost place, goes to
the charity of grain. But charity in the form of fearlessness, 1s
superior even to it. It can be divided into two classes. | |
(1) To make a man fearless, when he is in difficulties and
troubles, by helping him according to one’s power and resources.
"
1749,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1695 ,

(2) To free an entangled man, from the cycle of birth and
death, by narrating the life story of the Lord,* the publication of.
sacred texts such as the Gita, the Ramayana and the Bhagavata, |
their sale at a nominal rate, delivering of divine discourses, to
enable him to attain salvation. The Lord, is very much pleased
with this sort of service (Gita 18/ 68-69). Such service, is the best
of all the other, charities. But, while holding divine discourses,
the speaker should not regard himself, as superior to others. He
should think, that the Lord, in the form of audience, is giving :
him an opportunity, to make proper use, of his time. | :

A striver, should offer charity with the feeling that the Lord :
Himself, has offered the charity, by making him a tool. So, he
should offer it to the needy persons, with the feeling, that it is |
his duty to offer gifts, to them. -

‘Damah'—'Dama’' consists in controlling one’s senses. One .
should not perform, any forbidden action with senses, body and
mind. Actions should be performed, according to ordinance of |
scriptures, by renouncing selfishness and pride, for the welfare
of others. By doing so, senses are controlled, attachment and :
dependence, come to an end and one's body and senses act, in
a@ pure manner. |

When a striver's aim, is sense-control, he discharges his duty |
by performing actions, which are sanctioned by scriptures. Thus,
he becomes free from pride, attachment and desire etc. Thus he
is purified, and his senses are controlled.

'Yajiiah'—It means, (yajiia) offering daily oblation to sacred |
fire. Performance of ‘Balivaisvadeva' (offering a portion of the :
daily meal to creatures), according to one's caste, is also sacrifice.

* O Lord, the nectar of Your life history provides life and peace to the
distressed beings. The great souls describe it by heart. It destroys all the sins
and causes auspiciousness. The saints have described it in detail. Those who
narrate it on the earth, they are specially charitable to the world i.e., they do
the greatest good to the world (Srimadbha. 10/31/9).
"
1750,"1696 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 16
Besides it, from the view-point of Gita performance of one's
duty, according to one's caste, social order (stage of life). and
circumstances, is also. sacrifice (yajiia), provided it is for the .
welfare of others, and is free from. selfishness and pride. In.
addition, to these one's. profession, daily routine, obedience to
parents, teachers and elders, reverence. to cows, Brahmana (the
persons of the priest class), gods and the Lord, is also sacrifice
(yajiia), provided there is no desire for the fruit. 7
'Svadhyayah'—'Svadhyaya’ includes chanting of the Lord's _
name, and study of sacred books, such as. the Gita, the _
Bhagavata, the Ramayana and Mahabharata etc. In fact -
'Svadhyaya'’, means the proper study of one's dispositions and
situation viz., introspection. A striver, should be very. cautious.
He should not judge his progress, through changing propensities. —
Actually, these dispositions (propensities), always undergo
modifications, they appear and disappear. So should a striver,
not purify these? One must purify them. They can be easily
and quickly purified, when a striver, ceases to regard them, and
the inner sense, as his own. To regard them as one’s own is_-
impurity at the root. The self, being a fragment of the Lord, is
pure and it has never got tainted. Affinity with dispositions, veils
Self-realization. If we do not feel happy, in good dispositions
and sad, in evil dispositions, and never treat these dispositions, — -
as our own, by snapping total connection, with these, we can
have, Self-realization.. oo
'Tapah'—Austerity, consists in suffering hardships, such as
, hunger, thirst, cold, heat and rain etc.,.and knowingly tolerance _
of hardships happily, while discharging one's duty, and earning
_ one's livelihood, is real austerity* (tapa) because it destroys sins
and provides strength for toleration.
A striver, should not use his austerity, in granting boons, in
*The best austerity consists in welcoming the situation according to
favourable or unfavourable circumstances which are caused by the past actions. ee
"
1751,"Verse 2] _’ SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1697 ”
hurling curses, in doing evil to others and 1n satisfying desires.
But he should use it, happily in developing power, in order to
face obstacles, which hinder his spiritual progress. It is also
austerity. During the course of spiritual practice, several hurdles |
come to his notice. He thinks, that in seclusion and congenial .
atmosphere, spiritual practice can be easily successful. Not to
desire such circumstances viz., not to depend on them, is also
austerity. A striver, should never deem his spiritual progress,
dependent on favourable circumstances. Instead of having a
yearning for favourable circumstances, he should make the -
best possible use of circumstances, that are available, and go -
on progressing spiritually. He should try to seek seclusion. But
if it is not available, he should be engaged in spiritual practice, :
happily and zealously by regarding, the available circumstances, _
as God's gift.
'‘Arjavam'—A striver, should be straightforward and simple,
in his dealings, without attaching importance, to what the people
think of him. He should be upright and simple, in order to attain
salvation, even though people regard him, as a fool. Such a -
person free from deceit, attains salvation. He should harmonize his
thoughts, words and deeds, because the thoughts, words and deeds
of great souls are harmonized, while those of the vile, are not.

_ *Ahirhsa’ (Non-violence)— Infliction of pain or injury, on any .

being through body, mind, speech or feeling etc., is violence.
Non-injury, is known as non-violence. When a person, instead
of having an inclination for the world, has an inclination only, _
for the Lord, he observes non-violence, in the true sense of the
term. But, he who has desire and attachment, to enjoy worldly

| pleasure and also enjoys them, cannot be free from violence. He
degrades himself, and also destroys sense-objects, which he enjoys.
He, who enjoys limited worldly enjoyment, considering these ~
as his own, does violence. It is also violence, to regard worldly ~-
objects which have been bestowed upon us, for the service of
the world, as ours. But, a person, who uses available resources __
and persons, in the service of the world, without having any
attachment for them, becomes free, from violence. | -

‘When a person enjoys worldly pleasure with a selfish motive,
he inflicts pain, on those needy people who suffer shortage,
because they feel miserable and agonised, when they notice the
former's, enjoyment. Thus he commits violence. It is because of —_-
one's selfishness and enjoyment that he does not care, for others.
But, the great souls (saints), who satisfy bare necessities of their
life, in order to do, welfare to others, commit no sins or violence
(Gita 4/21), though a person may feel aggrieved, because of his
mean mentality and evil nature, when he sees those great souls,
satisfying their necessities.

A striver, who is devoted to God, never enjoys sense-objects
and so he never, commits violence. He never, inflicts the least __
pain, on anyone through his body, mind or speech. He is, ever
engrossed in the welfare of all beings, without causing pain to
anyone even mentally. If anyone becomes a stumbling block, in
his spiritual path, he is neither angry with him, nor does he think
of doing evil, to him. He being sad invokes the Lord, to remove
the stumbling block. But, he has neither anger, envy nor jealousy,
"
1753,"Verse 2] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1699 |

against the person who was as obstacle, to his spiritual progress.

He becomes, rather more prompt and more alert, because of his

inclination towards God. If he bears malice towards a person,

who creates an obstacle, it is his obstinacy in his-discipline and /

this shows, his lack of promptness in his practice.
In a striver, there are two traits—1-Promptness 2- Insistence.

The former, proves that he has interest in spiritual practice, while

the latter shows, that he is attached to spiritual practice. Due to

relish, he comes to know of his dificiency, and he develops power

to remove that deficiency, and makes an attempt to remove it. |

But, when there is attachment, there is possibility of a feeling of -

malice, against the person who creates, the hurdle. The fact is,

that if anybody creates an obstacle, it is because of the striver's

lack of interest. In case his relish is not lacking, nobody will _

create any hindrance, but he will become indifferent, to the

striver, thinking that the latter is obstinate and so, let him do

as he pleases. : .
As a flower, emits sweet fragrance automatically, so do

spiritual molecules emanate from a striver and the environment -

is purified. His feelings and activities, naturally are helpful for

the welfare of all beings. Thus, he perpetrates non-violence. But

he who pollutes the environment, through evil feelings and bad

conduct, commits, the evil of violence.
'Satyam'—Truth, consists in speaking agreeable words, honestly

and faithfully, of what has been heard, seen or experienced, for

the welfare of others, and by giving up selfishness and pride.

A striver, remains true through his mind, speech and actions, | .

because his only aim, is to realize the Truth namely God. .
‘Akrodhah'—Excitement caused, in mind to do evil to others,

is anger. This burning sensation of the mind finds outer expression

in the form of a burning sensation, in the body. Freedom from

anger, is ‘Akrodha’. If there is no feeling to do evil to others

tell them it 1s mere excitement not angers.
"
1754,"1700 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA (Chapter16  _

A striver, having God-realization as the aim of his life, is not
angry, even with those who do him wrong. He thinks that he is
receiving the fruit of his wrong actions, in the form of pain or
unfavourable circumstances. Such persons become instrumental _
in purifying him, of his sins. They are, rather his benefactors,
who are warning him to be careful, in future. They are just
like a surgeon, who performs an operation on a diseased part,
to make it healthy.

A striver, is not angry with those who exhaust his virtues, _
by praising and serving him. He thinks, that he does not deserve _
praise or service, and it is out of their good and virtuous nature, -
that they do so. His virtues are not exhausted, because he does _
not enjoy their praise or service etc., ie., he does not derive
pleasure, out of these. -

‘Tyagah’—Real renunciation, consists in having detachment,
from the world. A striver, should have external, as well as
internal, renunciation. He should renounce sinful, unjust and —
evil actions, and should not enjoy worldly pleasures. Besides,
he should renounce desire for the perishable, worldly things and -
objects etc., from his heart. Renunciation of desire, from the

_ heart, is superior to outward physical renunciation. Renunciation,
leads to immediate peace (Gita 12/12).

The desire for perishable, is the main obstacle to one's ~
spiritual progress. When a striver, instead of having the aim
of gaining worldly pleasures and prosperity, has only an aim for
God-realization, his desires go on disappearing. The more, he  __
renounces desire, the more, he advances spiritually. /

'Santih'—Absence of distractions, which evolve out of
attachment and aversion, is tranquillity or placidity. A striver,
remains tranquil in unfavourable circumstances, also by thinking,
that these destroy sins, and purify his inner sense of favourable
circumstances eat away virtues and there is every possibility of
degradation, rather than of progress. |
"
1755,"Verse 2] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1701 -
If by chance, his tranquillity is disturbed, out of attachment

or aversion, he at once becomes cautious, that being a striver, he

should not be affected, either by attachment or aversion. Thus

tranquillity, is regained and with passage of time, it is fixed.
‘Apaisunam'—-Exposing the faults of others, is 'Paisuna’ and

total absence of this tendency is 'Apaisuna’. When a man aims

at God-realization, he does not expose, the faults of others.

The more and more, a striver advances spiritually the more, ,

his feelings of malice and backbiting, are lessened and pure

feelings develop. Feelings of pride, do not haunt him. He does °

not regard anyone inferior to him, because he knows that no -

one has any affinity with Matter (Nature), the affinity is only, :

assumed. So, how can he expose the faults, of anyone? -
A striver, following the Discipline of Devotion, beholds the _

Lord, pervading everywhere, a striver following the Discipline

of Knowledge, remains established in the self i.e., beholds the

self alone everywhere while a striver, following the Discipline

of Action sees the served everywhere. So, how can a striver,

find fault with others.
""Daya bhiitesu'—The urge to relieve a being of his suffering, is

‘Daya’ (compassion). The Lord, saints, strivers and common men,

all possess this urge for compassion, but it is of different types.
(1) The Lord's compassion:—The Lord showers His

compassions, on all beings, in order to, purify them. The

Lord's compassion is of two types—{a) To create unfavourable

circumstances, to purge them of their sins is 'Krpa' (b) to create |

favourable circumstances, is ""Daya.'
(2) The saints' compassion:— The saints are sad, and happy,

with the sadness and happiness, of other beings. Their mercy,

is pure and holy. In fact, they are neither grieved, through their

own suffering nor through the sufferings, of others. They behold

the Lord's grace, in their own unfavourable circumstances. They

take upon themselves the sufferings of others, in order to make
"
1756,"1702 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 16
them happy... Indra, the king of gods, beheaded the innocent sage
- Dadhici, out of anger. But, when Indra demanded his bones
for his own safety, the latter sacrificed his life, and gave his |
bones, to the former. Thus, they sacrifice their life, in order to |
do. good, to others even though, other persons do wrong to them.
Similarly, Kama offered his skin and Sibi offered his flesh, for
the welfare of others, like the clouds, which offer their life for
the good of others. |
(3) Strivers' compassion:— A striver, tries his best to remove
the sufferings of other beings. His heart melts, when he sees the
sufferings of others. He has a feeling, that all should be liberated, -
and all should get bliss, no one should suffer. His mind, 1s filled
with these sentiments. He also makes efforts, for the same. But
he does not feel elevated and is not proud in anyway, by doing -
so. When he beholds people, performing sinful actions, he instead
of being angry, with them, takes pity upon them, and tries his
best to save them, from such sins. He also prays to God, to free
them from their sins. He thinks and acts, for their welfare. By
finding himself weak, he invokes the Lord, ""O Lord, let them
be relieved of their sufferings, and be, Your devotees."" |
(4) Compassion of common men:—A common man, pities
other persons with feelings that he is very kind and good. He
considers himself superior, to others and expects to receive honour
and praise etc., as a reward for his compassion. He shows mercy,
with a feeling of vanity. In that mercy, the element of mercy is
good, while the feeling of pride, is an impurity. |
There are other common men, who pity only those who .
belong to their family, sect or religion etc. This sort of mercy,
is more impure because of feelings of mineness and partiality.
Those who pity others, for their selfish motive, are even more
inferior to them.
Thus, compassion of common people, is impure.
‘Aloluptvam'— The attraction of senses, towards the objects
"
1757,"Verse 2] _ SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1703 |
of senses, when they come in contact, or when one sees other
beings enjoying them, is 'Loluptvam' (Covetousness), and the total
absence of this sort of covetousiiess, is ‘Aloluptvam' (freedom |
from covetousness). | -

_ The means, that to be free from covetousness: _

(i) A striver, should neither enjoy worldly pleasures nor be |
proud, that he has controlled his senses. | ,

(11) He should always think, that his aim is God-realization.

If sometime he feels any attraction or excitement, he should, “
invoke the Lord, ""O Lord, save me, protect me."" -

(111) He should not watch the lustful actions of living beings.
However if they come to his sight, he should think that they :
are gateways to hell and eighty-four lac forms, of lives, but he 7
has to be free from the cycle of birth and death, and, to attain
salvation. Such thinking is necessary to guard him. It should _
be kept intact. | -

""Mardavam'—Lack of sternness, viz., mildness of mind, even
for those, who have feelings of enmity towards him, and who -
trouble him is 'Mardavam’.* oS

A striver, is mild and gentle, even toward the. evil-doers. He
tries his best to be mild, in feelings and speech, for all beings.
Sometimes strivers, following different paths, as of Action, :
Knowledge and Devotion, may not appear equally mild, in their
dealings, but all of them are very mild, at: heart.

'Hrih'—'Hrih'’, is shame or hesitation, felt in the performance .
of actions, contrary to ordinance of scriptures and society,
either in loneliness or in company. When a striver, changes
his egoism and accepts that he is a devotee, or a striver whose
aim is God-realization, he hesitates, in performing forbidden
actions. oe

‘Acapalam'—Absence of fickleness is ‘Acapalam'. If anyone
is fickle, it does not mean, that the work is done quickly by
him. When a person, of the mode of goodness, performs an
action with steadiness, and patience, by giving up fickleness, it |
is performed, properly and promptly. When work is done well,
he becomes free from anxieties, and worries. In the absence of
fickleness, there attaches no evil of procrastination. As he has
no desire, besides performing his duty, his mind does not get .
bewildered and volatile (Gita 18/26). | :

Comment:— a |
'Tejah'—The power (vigour), of great men and. strivers
(endowed with divine traits), whose company enables sinners
to renounce their sins and be engaged, in virtuous actions, is
called 'Teja'. The evil-doers, hesitate to perform evil deeds
before those great men and strivers. These evil-doers, suddenly
change their actions and get engaged in virtuous deeds, before |
men of divine traits. In the face of a man of anger, also, other
persons have a feeling of fear, in acting against his will, this 1s
an upshot of anger.
'Ksama'—He, who is endowed with the virtue of 'Ksama’
(forgiveness)* tolerates the offence of others, without having
. _*What is the difference between 'Akrodha' (freedom from anger) and
‘Ksama (forgiveness)? When a person is endowed with forgiveness, he has Se

any inclination to retaliate, although he 1s strong enough, to

take vengeance. A man, may forgive his near and dear ones,
because of his attachment to them, but this forgiveness, is not
pure. Similarly, a man may forgive a cruel or a strong person .
out of fear, and he may forgive an officer for the latter's harsh

and abusive language, out of selfishness. But, this is not, real
forgiveness. A person, who possesses real forgiveness, thinks that

the wrong-doer should never be punished, here or hereafter.

A person may ask for forgiveness, in two ways:—

(1) A person asks for forgiveness having done something |
wrong, in order to escape punishment. 7: :

(2) A person asks for forgiveness,. having done something
wrong, with the intention that he will never do any wrong. This
sort of forgiveness, leads to progress.. SS -

~ Now the question arises, as to how to inculcate, forgiveness.

The answer is, that if a person does not expect any reward for

his actions, from others nor does he wish to do wrong to the
wrong-doers, the virtue of. forgiveness, develops in him.

‘Dhrtih'—The unwavering steadiness or fortitude, by ;
which one remains balanced, in favourable and unfavourable
circumstances, is ""Dhrti' (Gita 18/33). : a

In the mode of goodness, a man possesses the virtue of
fortitude, while he loses it, in the mode of passion and ignorance.

A Striver, who decides the aim of his life, neither gets disheartened

in calamities, nor is overwhelmed with joy, in prosperity. He does _

not divert his attention, by adverse and favourable circumstances. |
He wants to attain the goal, with unwavering steadiness, like a |
pilgrim, who on his pilgrimage to Badrinarayana, does not care __
for favourable or unfavourable circumstances, and moves ahead

an eye on the offender that he should not be punished, while in 'Akrodha’
(freedom from anger) he has an eye on himself that he should be free from anger

and burning sensation. Forgiveness includes ‘freedom from anger' while ‘freedom

from anger’ does not include forgiveness. Thus both of them are different.

patiently and promptly, to reach his destination. ) |
| ‘Saucam'—Purity is of two kinds—external and internal.* A
striver, having the aim of God-realization, maintains, external :
purity, because it leads to internal purity, while a person, who :
has internal purity, cannot tolerate external impurity. Patafijali
has said, that a striver, having external purity,. hates his body
and does not desire to mix with others. It means, that when a
striver maintains the purity of his body by clay and water etc.,
he realizes, that all bodies are impure and so other bodies have -
no attraction for him i.e., his desire to derive pleasure, out of .
contact with other bodies perishes. . | a -
External purity, is of four kinds:—{1) of the body, (2) of ;
speech, (3) of family, (4) of money: -
(1) Physical purity:—Heedlessness, laziness and fashions etc., -
make a body impure, while promptness, activity and simplicity
etc., purify the body. Purity is also achieved, by means of clay |
and water etc. - : |
(2) Purity of speech:——False, idle, bitter and slanderous -
talk, makes the tongue (speech) impure. Speech, devoid of these
| evils, but having true, agreeable, beneficial and necessary words,
which lead to spiritual progress of all persons, families, castes,
streets and countries, is pure.
(3) Purity of family:—Imparting good education to children,
for their welfare, teaching good conduct, impartiality, and
discharging one’s duty with justice, and sincerity—this is purity
of family. |
(4) Purity of money:—Money is purified, through just and .
honest dealings, keeping in mind, the welfare of others, giving it
to those who are poor, needy and destitute, and protecting cows,
women and Brahmanas. Moreover, it is purified by serving great
saints and sages, and by getting sacred books published for the

been discussed in the first verse of this chapter. — | | oo

sale at a cheap rates, so that there may be easy communication :
of their teachings. : : ,

When a person, has only the aim of God-reahization, he
himself is purified, and then his body, speech, family and :
money, are purified. When the body is purified, the atmosphere
also becomes pure and then a person realizes, that the body is
an abode of impurities and filth, and it is perishable. So, he
can easily renounce his egoism, and attachment. Thus, external
purity, leads one to God-realization. .

‘Adrohah'—Absence of malice, hatred or grudge, even towards .
those, who behave as enemies, is called 'Adroha'.* A person, -
having a propensity of malice or hatred, wants to take revenge
upon, a wrong doer, as and when, he gets an opportunity. But
how can a striver, whose aim is God-realization, think of injuring -
others, by having a grudge against them? A striver, following
the Discipline of Action, performs actions for the welfare of
all, a striver, following the Discipline of Knowledge, regards
everyone as his own self, while a striver, following the Discipline
of Devotion, beholds his Lord, in everyone. So, how can he have -
malice or hatred, for anyone? Oo |

""Natimanita’'—'Manita’, denotes pride, and ‘Atimanita, denotes
excessive pride. A proud man, thinks that he is superior to
common people, and so, he is worthy of being honoured by
them, while a very proud man, is he who considers himself
worthy of being honoured, even by his teachers and parents etc.,
who should be adored by him. Total negation of this pride, 1s |
called 'Natimanita’.

This pride or superiority, is of two kinds:— _

(i) Mundane:—A man, regards himself as superior to others,
in wealth, knowledge, rank, caste, qualities and social order (stage

* There is difference between 'Krodha’ (anger) and ""Drohah' (malice). The
burning sensation caused in the mind for the wrong-doer is 'Krodha’ while the

feeling of enmity to take revenge upon him is called ‘Drohah’. ~ ee

of life) etc., and thinks, that he is worthy of being honoured, by

others. (11) Spiritual:—-When some divine traits are revealed, in a
striver, he considers himself superior to other persons, and other
persons also, praise and honour him. But, he considers himself .
superior, so long as he has some demoniac traits. When he is
endowed, only with divine traits, he is not proud of such traits,

he becomes free from pride.

So long as, ego persists, a striver perceives some speciality,
in him. The more, this egoism is purged, the more, the feeling -
of speciality, vanishes. In the long run, in the absence of self- ~
conceitedness, divine traits of 'Natimanita’ (freedom from pride), -
are revealed, in him.

A striver, should aim to arouse divine nature, fully in _
him. Due to difference in nature, in different persons, variance
in virtues remains. But lack of virtue, pains a striver. So, by
depending on God, he should go on making efforts, to root out
demoniac traits. By doing so, by God's grace, divine nature, is
revealed in him. _

'Bhavanti sampadam daivimabhijatasya bharata'—~These, are
the marks of him, who is endowed with divine nature. When a
person, fixes his aim as God-realization, divine nature, is revealed
in him. Some divine traits, are also aroused, because of latencies .
of past births. But, a striver, does not regard those divine traits,
as his own; he thinks that the Lord has bestowed upon him, those
divine traits, by His grace. So he is not proud, of them.

Actually, divine nature, is not personal, it belongs to the ;
Lord. Had it been personal, a person, would have possessed it
forever. But it is not so. When a person regards it, as his own,
he has pride, which is a mark of a wicked nature. This pride,
gives birth, to all the other traits of such nature. If a person,
possesses only divine traits, he cannot be proud, of them. He is
proud of them, only when he is endowed with bad nature also.
Suppose a man is proud of truth in speech, it means, he also a
"
1763,"Verse 3] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1709 |

tells a lie, besides speaking the truth. Thus a man, is proud of

his divine traits, regarding these, as his own, and thereby having

demoniac traits in him. When virtues, in totality are inculcated,

there cannot be any pride, of those virtues. :
Divine nature is the Lord's, own. So when a devotee, depends

on Him only, His divine nature, is naturally revealed in him.

Lord Rama in the Ramacaritamanasa, declares to Sabari ‘that a

man, woman or creature that has anyone of the nine kinds of

devotion, to Him is, very loving to Him. .
All the mobile and the immobile creatures, such as human

beings, gods, ghosts and evil spirits, beasts and birds, moths, -

insects and creepers etc., have a desire to live, to maintain their .

life-breath. This desire, denotes a satanic nature.
Even a detached and dispassionate striver, has a latent desire

to hive. But he has no covetousness, for sense-objects, as his aim

is only God-realization, rather than to nourish his body. ,
But, when he develops his devotion to God, He becomes

dearer to him, than even his life-breath and he addresses Him, as

‘the Lord of life-breath’ or 'Dearer than life-breath' etc. He can

even die, for Him because he cannot bear any separation, from

God. He sacrifices, even his life happily for Him, in the same

way, as a chaste wife, at the death of her husband, burns herself |

on her husband's funeral pyre willingly and happily. It means,

that when a devotee develops exclusive devotion to God, he is,

no more attached to his life, his demoniac nature, totally comes

to an end, and divine nature is spontaneously revealed, in him. ;

Gosvami Tulasidasa, has also mentioned in the Ramacaritamanasa,

that hidden traces of internal impurity, can never be removed

without, the water of devotion. |

Comment:— | :

'‘Dambhah'—'Dambha’, consists in making a show of one's |
Virtues, in order to gain honour, fame and praise etc., even when, —
one does not possess, those virtues. It can be of two kinds:—

(i) A person may pose as a righteous, virtuous, scholarly,
wise person, even though he has no such virtues. To show more
than he possesses, to show himself as an ascetic, in spite of
being sensuous and ostentatious in, feelings and actions—this is 7
hypocrisy. (ii) He may conceal his good conduct, eat forbidden
food, and perform forbidden actions, in the company of evil
persons, in order to, win respect and praise, by pleasing them.

When a person, attaches too much importance, to his body, |
life-breath, wealth, property, honour, praise and fame, he pretends,
to be what he is not and hypocrisy appears in him. ©

‘Darpah'—It means arrogance, pride of possessions of
riches, property, family, rank and position etc., is known as -
""‘Darpah'. Because of this feeling, a man is proud of the things,
he possesses. a

A person may regard himself superior and exalted, because of
superiority of his physical (gross), subtle and causal bodies. He
regards himself superior, to others, because of his high caste, high _

'Krodhah’'—Excitement or burning sensation, caused in the
mind, in order to do wrong to others, is ‘Krodha’ (anger). It
appears, when one does something, against a man's wishes. There
is difference between ‘Krodha’ (anger) and ‘Ksobha’ (agitation,
commotion). When a child does a mischief, and does not obey .
the parents, they scold him out of 'Ksobha’, so that it may not
repeat the mischief again, while in anger, there 1s tendency to -
do wrong, to the person with whom one is angry. —_ |
A man, has to repent for wrong actions which he performs,
overpowered by anger. When he is angry, he harms not only 7
others, but also himself. Moreover, he can do wrong to others,
only if they have to suffer it, as fruit of their wrong actions.
But, he commits a sin, and spoils his nature. His spoiled nature,
will lead him to hell and painful forms of lives. oe -
Anger, is the foremost enemy of a person because it, abiding
in the body, destroys the body, in the same way as fire abiding
in wood, burns the wood. Everyone including the nearest and
the dearest one, is afraid of an angry man. In the twenty-first
verse of this chapter, anger has been called, as the gateway to
hell. When a man's desire is not fulfilled, anger ensues. From
anger, arises delusion; from delusion, a confusion of memory;
from which comes, loss of reason; and from loss of reason, one .
goes to complete ruin (Gita .2/62-63). :

air, is bodily harshness. Seeing with harsh eyes, is harshness

of eyes. Speaking bitter, taunting and harsh words, constitute

harshness of speech. Getting pleased by not helping other

creatures, in their adversity is harshness of heart. Vengeance,

is harshness in dealings. _ - 7 . |

A man, with a selfish motive, wants to fulfil his desire by
fair means or foul, without thinking, of the trouble of others. So
there remains, harshness in his mind, speech, body and behaviour. :
Out of selfishness, he even commits violence, without thinking =.
of its consequences. With the predominance of self-interest, a :
man even commits violence. Thus he develops cruelty, in his |

absence of serenity, his dealings become harsh. Thus he engages ”
himself, in extorting money, and harassing others, without caring
for the result. | | |

'Ajiiinam'—Here 'Ajfiana’, denotes ignorance or lack of
discrimination. An ignorant man cannot distinguish, the real
from the unreal, virtue from sin, and duty from forbidden
actions, because he hankers after perishable worldly pleasures
and prosperity, without thinking of the consequences. Such ignorant
people, like beasts, are given to gratify their life. What ought
_ to be done and what ought not to be done—they cannot know |
and they do not want to know.

They regard momentary pleasures, which are born of sense
contacts, as real pleasure and so make effort to enjoy them. But :
their fruit, is negative. Instead of pleasure one gets pain.* Even :
then, he is not warned. He performs ‘forbidden actions, in order
to get honour, praise, comfort, wealth and property etc. But,

* O King! people bound by husband-wife relationship etc., perform actions
in order to derive pleasure and be free from pain. But those who want to
cross the illusion, should think that their actions bear contrary fruits. Instead
of enjoying pleasures, they suffer pain; and instead of getting rid of the pain,
their pain goes on increasing (Srimadbhaga. 11/3/18). oo —————_——_

their fruit is disastrous for him, as well as, for the entire world.
‘Abhijatasya partha sampadamasurim'—O Partha, these are
the marks of a person, who is endowed. with demoniac nature.*
A person, by identifying himself with the body, has desire to =
remain alive forever, and enjoy worldly pleasure. The marks
of demoniac nature, are seen, in such a person.
In the fortieth verse of the eighteenth chapter, the Lord.
declares, that there is no creature which is free from the three
modes of nature. It proves, that every person in spite of being a “
fragment of the Lord, is born having affinity with nature (prakrti). a
He has the affinity of ‘I'ness and mineness with the body, an -
evolute of Nature; and the affinity of 'Mineness', with things,
objects and persons etc., evolutes of Nature. This feeling of, 'I'ness
or 'Mineness'’, is the fundamental mark, of demoniac nature. -
A man's relationship with prakrti, is merely assumed. So
he can renounce it. The reason is, that he (the self), is sentient |
and immutable, while prakrti is insentient and kaleidoscopic.
So, there is no real relationship between the two, it is merely
an assumed one. As soon as this relationship is renounced, the 7

The firmer a striver, is in his aim, the more, easily his real

assumed his connection through his identification with the body. _
He regards the body as 'T', and also as 'mine’. As soon as, he
renounces this assumed affinity, the divine nature, which leads

This divine nature, is conducive not only to one's own
liberation, but also to the liberation of all beings. The Lord,
has bestowed this human body, so that a person may lead all
beings to salvation, in the same way, as the head of a family,

such a right by the Lord, that by serving Him, he can even oe

control Him. A striver, should perform, virtuous actions, suchas =
austerity, charity, sacrifice, pilgrimage, fast, chanting, meditation,
study of sacred books and retain good company, for the salvation
of numberless beings of infinite universes, and should pray to
God, from the core of his heart, through these words, ""O Lord!
Grant exclusive devotion and salvation, to ali the beings. This —

mind, intellect, wealth and property etc., to the Lord, for the
salvation of the world.* By doing so, he will realize the identity -
of his possessions, with the world and his natural identity with .
the Lord, will be revealed. This has been termed by the Lord, by -
the expression, ‘the divine nature is conducive to liberation. |
'Nibandhayasuri mata'—The demoniac nature, is conducive to -
bondage viz., the cycle of birth and death. So long as a striver,
_ does not remove his egoism, his virtuous actions, will not lead
him to salvation, even these may Jead him to higher regions. a
It means, that so long as, he has the desire to maintain his
body, and to enjoy sense-objects, in his ego the divine traits, _
superimposed on himself, will not lead him to salvation, though
they may bear some pleasant fruit. :
The seed of a plant grows, into the tree and fruit of the
same category. Similarly, virtuous actions performed by a striver,
who has past worldly influences, will bear mundane fruit, in the
form of accomplishments, such as ‘Anima’ and 'Garima' etc., and
higher regions, such as the realm of Brahma, but they cannot
lead to, salvation (Gita 8/16).
Now the question arises, as to how a man, should
attain. salvation. The answer is, that as a roasted or boiled
- seed, does not germinate, similarly, when a striver only has
the aim of God-realization, all the worldly seeds perish, his
* The feeling that all beings should attain salvation is the Lord's divine
nature, it is not one’s own. It is only the Lord Who is one's own.
"
1770,"1716 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 16
egoism changes, and he attains salvation.

A person, has attachment for his body, and life-breath, so
that he could go on living happily and enjoying honour, praise
and pleasure etc. It is because of this attachment, that he cannot ""
attain salvation, because attachment to the modes of nature, is the
cause of birth, in good and evil wombs (Gita 13/21). It means,
that he being attached to nature (prakrt!), may go even to the
realm of Brahma, but will not be free, from bondage.

The Lord, in this chapter, has mentioned three fruits of -
demoniac nature. Here in this verse, He mentions the first fruit,
as bondage. The worldly minded people, who perform actions, ~*~
with a desire for their fruit, (as described in the verses from the ~
forty-one to the forty-fourth of the second chapter and also in the
twentieth and twenty-first verses of the ninth chapter), also belong /
to the category of those, whose actions are conducive to bondage.
The intellect of those, who hanker after worldly pleasure and
prosperity, is many branched i.e., their desires are endless. They 7
perform actions, in order to fulfil their desires, which result in
rebirth (Gita 2/41—44). Similarly, those, who perform sacrifices,
in order to gain heavenly pleasure, enjoy heavenly pleasure, being
purged of their sins, which were obstacles to the attainment of .
heaven, having enjoyed extensive heavenly world, return to the
world of mortals, on the exhaustion of their merits (Gita 9/20-21).

Now a question arises, that a striver who falls from Yoga
(Gita 6/41), goes by the same path of the dark fortnight, as a :
person, having desire for fruit of actions, goes (Gita 8/25); so
the path of a striver, who falls from Yoga, should be conducive
to bondage. The answer is, that a striver who falls from Yoga,
has no bondage, because in the previous human life, his aim
has been to realize God and because of some lust (desire) or
unconsciousness or excessive pain, he had to go to heaven etc.,
"
1771,"Verse 5] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1717 .
instead of realizing God. So the term Yogi, has been used for

them (Gita 8/25), otherwise persons who perform actions, for

their fruit cannot be called, Yogis.

The second fruit, is that people of demoniac nature, fall .
into a foul hell (Gita 16/16). Those who, being overwhelmed
with desire, commit sins and injustice etc., go to hell, such as
‘Kumbhipaka' etc. :

The third fruit of demoniac nature, is that those evil-doers,
are hurled into the wombs of demons and then they go to most .
abominable type of existence, (Gita 16/19-20). ;

'Ma Sucah sampadam daivimabhijato'si pandava'—Divine -
nature, leads to salvation while demoniac one, leads to bondage.

Lord Krsna, explains to Arjuna, that he is born with a divine |
nature, so that he may not doubt, whether he is born with divine ~
nature, or not.

A striver, having attained divine nature naturally follows
the path of Action, Knowledge or Devotion. All the sins of a
Karmayogl, through actions and those of a Jianayogi, through ©
the fire of wisdom, are destroyed (Gita 4/23,37). But the Lord -
destroys, all the sins of Bhaktiyogi (Gita 18/66); and delivers
him from, the ocean of birth and death (Gita 12/7).

""Ma sucah'—Lord Krsna, in the third verse, addresses Arjuna |
as ‘Bharata’, in the fourth verse as ‘Partha’, and in the fifth verse :
as 'Pandava’, in order to encourage him. By addressing him as
Bharata, He means to say, that he belongs to an excellent family;
and by addressing him as Partha, he says that he is the son of
Prtha (Kunti), who served even those who had feelings of enmity .
towards her. And by addressing him as Pandava, he wants to
emphasize, that he is the son of a righteous and noble father,
Pandu. Thus because of his excellent family, noble and virtuous
parents, he possesses a divine nature. So he should not, grieve.

In the Gita, the Lord has used the expression ""Ma sucah'
(Grieve not), two times, once here and once, in the sixty-sixth
"
1772,": 1718 ' -  SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA (Chapter 16

verse of the eighteenth chapter. The Lord, by using it two times,

- wants to assure him, that he should not worry, either about the
means or the end. He possesses the means, as he is endowed
with divine nature (16/5) and he need not worry about the end, -
because He will liberate him, from all sins (18/66). The Lord,
through the medium of Arjuna, assures all strivers, that they need
not lose heart by thinking that they do not possess virtue, and so
they will not be liberated, from the cycle of birth and death.

Persons, who possess divine nature always think of attaining —_.
salvation, in favourable, as well as unfavourable circumstances. __.
When Lord Krsna, placed the chariot between the two armies, -
Arjuna, seeing all his relations there, was filled with compassion
and sadness, and he expressed his reluctance to fight. He thought,
that sin would accrue to him, by killing his kinsmen, in the war. -
Thus, he was filled with attachment or delusion, for the family
which is of demoniac nature and also, thought of the fear of sin,
an obstacle to salvation, which is divine nature. —

According to Arjuna, it was a sin to resolve to fight (1/45).
Time and again he asked Lord Krsna, to tell him of his duty,so  ——
that he could attain, to the highest good or salvation, as he was
confused (2/7, 3/2, 5/1). This shows his divine nature. On the
contrary, Duryodhana etc., and the members of the rival army,
saw no sin in the destruction of the family (1/38). So Arjuna,

_ ‘possessed divine nature, from the very beginning. Attachment or
delusion, the demoniac nature seen in Anjuna was a temporary
phase, of his life, which was destroyed through the Lord's grace
(18/73). So here, Lord Krsna, advises Arjuna not to grieve.

Arjuna, does: not feel that he is endowed, with divine
nature. So, Lord Krsna says, to him, ""Grieve not, because you
are endowed with divine nature."" The reason 1s, that noble men
do not behold virtues in them, when they become totally free,
from vices. As collyrium applied to eyes, cannot be seen, by the
eyes, because it identifies itself, with the eyes, similarly, those
"
1773,"Verse 5} -SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 9
possessing divine nature, become one with it, so divine traits
‘cannot be seen separately from them. Therefore, Lord Krsna,
assures Arjuna, that he possesses divine nature naturally, so he ,
need not worry. | — -

_ The Lord by His grace, has bestowed a human body, so
that a man may attain salvation. This body, is transitory and
perishable, and nothing is certain about it, it may die any
moment. So a man should develop divine nature, and renounce :
demoniac nature. -

The term ‘Deva’, in 'Daivi sampada’, denotes God. Being
a fragment of God, a man possesses divine nature, naturally. ;
But, when he (soul), having a disinclination for God, has an ~
inclination for prakrti (nature) i.e., he identifies himself, with the
perishable body etc., demoniac nature manifests, itself in him
and all evil propensities, such as lust, anger, greed, delusion,
hypocrisy, envy and jealousy etc., arise in him. The desire to
maintain life-breath happily, is an important mark, of a man of -
demoniac nature. -

Liberated souls, are totally free from demoniac nature, while

all other beings possess, both divine and demoniac nature (16/6).
Being a fragment of God, every person possesses divine nature, |
but sometimes, because of predominance of demoniac nature,
divine nature, is concealed.

_It.cannot perish, because the real, never ceases to be. So
far as, liberated souls are concerned, they are totally free, from -
demoniac traits.* Because of his intrinsic nature a person can
never be totally cruel, sinful, vile and corrupt. Even the vilest

* The liberated souls being detached from the perishable get established

in imperishable God. Being established in the real (God), virtues automatically
prevail in them. These perfected souls rise above the divine traits which are
ideal for strivers.
"
1774,"1720 _ SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA | _ [Chapter 16
sinner, possesses virtue to some extent. As soon as, divine nature
manifests itself, demoniac nature, comes to an end, because divine
nature, is imperishable, as it belongs to the Lord, while demoniac
nature, is perishable as it pertains to the world. ==
A man, being a fragment of God, Who is Truth, Consciousness
and Bliss solidified, and has a desire to live, to know and to
be happy. But, he wants to live with the body, wants to know,
with the intellect and wants to be happy, with the help of the
body and senses. He wants to fulfil these desires, through the  -
perishable world. Oo OB
Thus because of his attachment to life-breath, he possesses |
demoniac nature.* There is one vital point, which needs special
attention. He has a desire to live, it means that he (soul), can live
alive. He (soul), being a fragment of the Lord, is imperishable
but by having affinity of T'ness and mineness with the body,
he.assumes the death of body, as his own death. Similarly, he /
wants to be wise, with the help of the intellect, and he has a
desire to be happy, and maintain his name.and fame, even after
his death by identifying himself, with the body. But the intellect
and the body, are perishable and insentient, while he (soul) is
imperishable, and sentient. So, how can the perishable (unreal)
and insentient, provide knowledge, (wisdom) and happiness, to the
imperishable (real) and the sentient? Thus when he is connected |
with the unreal, he, in spite of being an embodiment of Truth,
Knowledge and Bliss, has desire to live, to gain knowledge
and to be happy. He wants these desires, to be fulfilled by the |
perishable world. Thus demoniac nature is manifested, in him.
But when he renounces his affinity with the unreal, the demoniac
nature perishes, and divine nature, is revealed in him..
* When a man identifies himself with the body he is attached to the life-
| breath by having the desire to live happily. This identification gives birth to
the demoniac nature. Therefore the embodied who are mentioned in the Gita
by the terms ‘Dehavadbhih' (12/5) and 'Dehinam’ (3/40; 14/5,7), should be
included among those who possess demoniac nature. _ —.
"
1775,"Verse 5} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1721 ;
__ When a person,wants to develop divine traits in him, by making
effort through devotion, meditation, good company and study of
sacred books etc., as a part of his duty, he cannot develop these
fully, because whatever is gained by effort is not natural, but
is artificial. Moreover, he develops pride, that he has developed |
these virtues, by his efforts. This pride, is a demoniac trait, which
is the root of all evils, and which nourishes evil. Pride persists,
in spiritual practice, which is done by effort. When he fails to
cultivating the divine traits, he accepts, that it is beyond his
control. But, when he realizes, that attachment for the perishable, =
is the root of demoniac nature, he renounces, this attachment. In -
that case, divine nature reveals itself in him, because he being 7
a fragment of God, automatically possesses it.
There is one more vital point, which needs attention. A man -
cannot totally renounce, divine traits. How to know this fact?
If a man, decides to speak the truth, he could speak the truth,
throughout his life. But if he decides to tell a lie, even for a day, )
he cannot do so. If someone asks him, whether he is hungry, and
he tells a lie, by saying that he is not, he will, have to face a lot -
of difficulty. But if a person takes an oath, to tell a lie, even if
he dies, his oath will prove to be true. Similar, is the case with
other divine traits, because all of these are eternal, and natural.
A striver, has only to renounce his attachment for the perishable,
because attachment to it is assumed, not natural.
_ Demoniac nature, is unnatural, it appears and disappears, while
divine nature is natural. If a man has bad conduct, everybody
asks him, why he is behaving, badly. But, no one asks him the
reason, when his conduct,.is good. |
Asjuna specially, possessed divine nature. So Lord Krsna
asked Arjuna, whence this unmanliness came upon him (2/2-3). It .
means, that this unmanliness (weakness) was not. naturally present,
in him. So Arjuna asks Lord Krsna, the means to attain to the
highest good or salvation (2/7; 3/2; 5/1), even in the battlefield.
"
1776,"1722 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter16
It shows, that Arjuna, possessed divine nature, otherwise how
could he reject the offer of Urvasi, a heavenly damsel, outright?
Therefore, assuring Arjuna, Lord. Krsna, asks him not to grieve, :
because he is born, with a divine nature (16/5). . -
A feeling of egoism, is born out of the identification of the
real, with the unreal. A man performs, virtuous or evil actions,
having egoism. When he follows the spiritual path, there remains
predominance, of the real in egoism, while there is predominance
of the unreal, when he follows a mundane path. Divine nature, :
is revealed in a person, when there is predominance of the self, .
and demoniac nature goes on aggravating in him, during the -
predominance of the non-self. This human body, has been |
bestowed upon him, to enable him to be free, from demoniac
nature. Every human being, is independent and strong to get rid -
of it. It is because of a person's affinity with the _ perishable,
that he cannot get rid of it. Oo | .
A man (soul), identifies himself with matter. Actually,
there is no desire in a man (pure soul), desire abides, only in -
the unreal portion of ego. But the soul is said to be, the cause
of experience of pleasure and pain (13/20). Actually, the soul
is not the cause, but the soul seated in nature, becomes an
experiencer (13/21). Actually, the unreal (insentient) undergoes
modifications, such as pleasure or pain. But, because the real
(sentient), has identification with the unreal. So, the real has to
experience, pleasure and pain. As, after marriage wife's needs
become the husband's needs, similarly, the soul by identification
with, body and thus assuming itself, as a doer has to become the
experiencer of pleasure and pain, while all actions are performed
by nature (3/27, 13/29). In effect, when a man has a desire for
God-realization, there is predominance of the sentient (real), but
when he has a desire for the mundane, there is predominance, of
the insentient. The predominance of the sentient, gives birth. to
divine nature, while predominance of the insentient, gives birth ee
"
1777,"Verse 5] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1723
to demoniac nature. The sentient in spite of its identification with
the insentient, has a desire for truth, consciousness and bliss.
All the worldly desires, are included in these three desires (to
live forever, to know all, and ever to remain happy). But man .
commits an error, that he wants to satisfy these desires, by the ©
insentient (world). oe
The sentient, has assumed its identification with the insentient |
and it has also accepted, the demoniac nature. The sentient, always
remains uniform, without undergoing any modification, while |
nature (the insentient) undergoes, continuous modifications. If /
the self (sentient), does not assume its affinity of ‘ness and -
mineness, with nature, it is free. Thus affinity of the sentient, with
matter, and the demoniac nature born of this affinity, are one's |
own creation. Had the demoniac nature been in the self, it would _
not have perished, because the self is imperishable. No question
would have been raised, to renounce demoniac nature. In spite
of being perishable, it appears to be umperishable, because of its
affinity with the imperishable. Therefore, a man can renounce,
demoniac nature and can realize, God (16/22). -
As soon as, a man inclines towards God, sins of his millions
of births (the demoniac traits), perish. The reason is, that he has
accumulated these sins, by assuming affinity with nature. The
result of this assumed affinity, is that he has to take birth, in
good and evil bodies (13/21). Actually, he neither acts, nor gets
contaminated (13/31). | |
The realization of this truth means, to see inaction in action, | :
and action in inaction. It means, that he remains detached, while -
performing actions and performs actions, remaining detached L.e., ©
he remains detached, whether he performs actions or not. Such a
man is wise, among men (4/18). He who is free from the notion
of doership, and whose intellect is not tainted ie., he has no
desire, though he slays all people, he does not slay, nor is he
bound (by his action) (18/17). Arjuna asked Lord Krsna, ""By
"
1778,"1724 | SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter16
what, is a man impelled to commit sin?"" Lord Krsna replied,

""It is desire"" (3/36-37) which impels a man to commit sins. A
man, by identifying himself with a body, has a desire for worldly
pleasure and prosperity.* So this attachment to the matter is the -
cause of demoniac nature. If he is not attached to it 1.e., he does
not attach importance to it, his divine nature is self-evident. So
Lord Krsna assures all the strivers, through Arjuna, that they
should not grieve and worry, if they see demoniac nature in them, _
because they naturally possess divine nature also (Gita 16/5).

The Lord means, that a striver should never be disappointed,
in the spiritual path, because being a fragment of God he  -
automatically possesses divine nature. When a striver, aims at
God-realization, divine nature, is automatically revealed, in him. -
The Lord has bestowed this human body by His grace, so that
human beings may realize Him. So, if they have no will of their
own but identify their will, with that of the Lord, they by His __
grace, attain salvation automatically.

Appendix—On one side of the soul, there is God while on
the other side, there is the world. When a man (the soul), has an
inclination to God, he is endowed with divine nature; and when he __
has an inclination to the world, he is endowed with the demoniac
nature. In divine nature there is non-atheism while in demoniac
nature, there is atheism. Though all the spiritual disciplines
(Karmayoga, Jianayoga and Dhyanayoga etc.,) for salvation are
included within the divine nature—‘daivi sampadvimoksaya’, yet
in the divine nature there is predominance of devotion. Therefore
the Lord in the topic of devotion declares—

mahatmanastu mam partha daivim prakrtimasritah .

bhajantyananyamanaso jnatva bhutadimavyayam

(Gita 9/13)

* No one wants to be a guilty because a guilty is insulted, rejected and
blamed by the society here, while hereafter he has to go to hells and take birth in
eighty-four lac forms of lives. But a man being overpowered by desire, born of
the attachment to the perishable, performs forbidden actions which bear adverse
fruit and the man becomes a defaulter and a sinner (against his wish).
"
1779,"Verse 5] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1725 -

“QO Arjuna! The great Souls who possess divine nature,
knowing Me as the sole and prime cause of creation and as
imperishable, worship Me constantly with undivided mind.”

Ahead also the Lord declares—‘mamaprapyaiva kaunteya........’ ;
(16/20). Within devotion all the means for salvation are included. |
Those who love their life-breath and look upon the maintenance
of the life-breath as their highest goal are endowed with the
demoniac nature. But those, who regard God as more loving /
than their life-breath, are endowed with divine nature.

Performance of actions to comfort others or the desire to :
comfort others is ‘sentience’ while performance of actions for one’s -
own comfort or desire for one’s own comfort, is ‘insentience’.

Adoration and meditation also for one’s own happiness, for a -
peaceful life and for honour and respect is also insentience. When _
there is predominance of the sentience, the man is endowed with

the divine nature; but when there is predominance of insentience,

the man is endowed with the demoniac nature.

The root-evil is one which gives birth to all demoniac traits
and the fundamental virtue is also one by which all the divine -
traits are revealed. The fundamental evil is—to accept the existence
and value of the body and the world and to get attached to
them. The fundamental virtue is—to accept the existence and
value of God and to be attached to Him. The fundamental evil
and the fundamental virtue, appear in different forms because
of different situations.

So long as evils persist with virtues, the virtues appear to :
be valuable and a man is proud of them. If a person gets rid of .
evils totally, he is not proud of his virtues. Pride is the root of the
demoniac nature. It is because of pride that a man feels that he is
superior to others—this is his demoniac nature. It is because of
pride that even the divine nature intensifies the demoniac nature.

When evils don’t persist with virtues, then virtues are not valued
by him and he is not proud of them. As a striver does not value
"
1780,"1726 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 16
his virtues, so his attention is not diverted to his virtues and thus
he gets non-plussed.* Arjuna’s attention was also not diverted to
his virtues and so he was perturbed that he did not possess divine
traits. In such a situation to remove his grief, Lord Krsna asks___-
him not to grieve because he is born with divine nature—‘ma

(Gita 10/39; 18/40). When the sentient has an inclination for

the insentient, a person develops demoniac nature, but when he

having a disinclination for matter, is inclined towards the Lord,

divine nature is aroused in him.
The term 'Deva', denotes God. So all the means, which are

conducive to God-realization are known as, divine endowments

(nature). As He is eternal and imperishable, so the methods of

His realization are also eternal (Gita 4/1). :
The term 'Bhuta, includes—human beings, gods, demons, :

beasts, birds, insects, moths, plants, creepers, evil spirits etc. But .

human beings, have a discrimination to renounce, demoniac nature. -

So they should renounce it, totally. As soon as, they remove it,

divine nature is automatically revealed in them. | ~
It is mentioned in the scriptures, that human beings possess .

both the divine and demoniac natures. Even the cruelest butcher,

possesses kindness, because a person being the fragment of the

Lord, possesses divine nature automatically; while he develops

demoniac nature in him, because of his attachment, for the

perishable. Strivers, who follow a spiritual path, from their hearts, -

feel hurt, when they find demoniac nature, in them and they

try to get rid of it. But strivers, who in spite of being engaged

in devotion and adoration, hanker after worldly pleasure and

prosperity, are not strivers indeed, because even the vilest sinner

automatically possesses, both divine and demoniac natures.
A point needs special attention. A person, performs actions

according to his egoism and his actions strengthen his egoism. ‘I

am truthful'—this conviction is centred in man's ego, and so he |

speaks the truth, and this truth strengthens his egoism, that he is

true. Thus, he cannot tell a lie. But a person, who regards himself

as worldly and hankers after worldly pleasure and prosperity,

tells a lie and thinks, that in the modern world falsehood, is

inevitable and indispensable. So, having such feelings in his

‘ego’, he regards it, impossible to get rid of evil and vice.
"
1782,"1728 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA (Chapter16
A man, being a fragment of God, has virtuous feelings, while
having feelings of egoism, and attachment, he develops evils.
But evil feelings cannot destroy virtuous feelings totally, because
the latter are real and the real, never ceases to be (2/16). On
the contrary, evil feelings are born of bad company and
whatever is born, is surely to perish, because the unreal has no
existence (2/16). A person, whose aim is God-realization arouses
virtuous feelings, and performs virtuous actions, and so his
evil feelings, disappear. But he, whose aim is, to enjoy worldly
pleasure and prosperity, develops evil feelings and performs evil —
actions, his good feelings are covered. _ oe oo
The term ‘Loke'smin’, denotes that a person, gets several
rights, on this earth. On this earth, particularly, India is the —
most pious land. Even the gods praise, persons who are born, -
in India.They aré more blessed than the gods, because, the gods,
have a yearning for the good fortune of human life, which the
Lord having been pleased, has offered human being in India. A
man, Can attain salvation only, in this human life. So he should
arouse divine nature, cautiously. The Lord, by His special grace,
has granted this human body..The Lord has also offered men all
the resources, including discrimination, to attain salvation. So the
term ‘Loke'smin’, specially denotes human beings. But the Lord,
is equally present in all beings (Gita 9/29). Where there is God,
there is His divine nature. So the expression ‘Bhiitasargau’, has
been used. It means, that all beings can follow the spiritual path.
Human beings, who are absorbed in evil actions, are more __
guilty than those of sinful births—pariah, beasts, birds, insects
and moths etc., because the latter, being purified of sins as a
result of their past actions are going towards higher births, while
the former are degrading themselves, by committing new sins.
But. the Lord, declares that even such sinners by worshipping
Him, with exclusive devotion, can attain eternal peace (9/30-31).
Similarly, the most sinful of all sinners, crossing all sins by

1783,"Verse 6] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1729 |
a raft of knowledge, can attain salvation (4/36). It means, that |
when even the vilest sinner, can attain salvation, and those
of sinful births, can also attain salvation. So the term ‘Bhiuta’ |
(beings), has been used. .
There are several incidents, which show that besides human
beings other beings, such as birds and beasts etc., also possess
divine nature.* Several dogs, are heard observing fasts. At |
Gorakhpur, a black dog accompanied a group of devotees, who
chanted the Lord's name and sat at place, where divine discourses .
were held. At Svargasrama, RsikeSa, a snake was seen under -
a banyan tree. A saint asked it to stay, and he narrated the ~
whole of the Gita. The snake listened to it calmly. When the
text was over, the snake disappeared and was never seen again. :
Thus birds and animals also possess, divine nature, because of -
past impressions, but they, unlike human beings, ‘have no
* In Santiparva, a section of the epic, Mahabharata there is a story.
Sakunilubdhaka was a hunter, who used to kill birds and beasts. One day he
could get nothing to eat, by hunting. Suddenly the sky was overcast and there
was a downpour. So he sat under a tree. On that tree, there lived a couple of _
pigeons. Both of these had flown away. to pick up food. The female pigeon
flew back earlier, because she got drenched. She was shivering and so she fell
down. The hunter put her, into his cage. The pigeon came back and finding
his partner missing, began to lament. Hearing his wail she said, ""My lord,
why are you lamenting? You should discharge your duty, by welcoming a -
guest by removing his cold and satisfying his hunger. I am lying here in the
cage. Hearing her words, the pigeon gathered dry leaves and wood, brought
a burning stick and put it on the dry leaves. The hunter got warmth. He said
to the pigeon, ""I am hungry. What should I do?"" The pigeon said, ""You are ;
my guest. I shall make arrangement to satisfy your hunger."" He thought over
it and finding no other remedy, he took three rounds of fire and jumped into
it. Seeing his sacrifice, the hunter thought that he was very cruel and sinful,
while the bird was virtuous. He determined never to commit such sins, in future.
So he freed the she pigeon. She lamented over the death of her husband, and
finding herself alone, jumped into the fire. A celestial car, moving in the air
arrived, and both of the pigeons, went to heaven.
Seeing both of them going in the celestial car, the hunter threw his weapon away
and decided to be engaged in devotion and adoration, which led him to salvation.

so that our life may be pure, here and hereafter. -

described divine nature, at length. In this chapter, He has described
the twenty-six signs (nine in the first verse, eleven in the second
verse and six in the third verse) of him, who is endowed with
divine nature. He has also described it, in the signs of him who
has transcended, the three modes of nature (14/22—25), (in the ~
twenty virtues of Jnana (knowledge or wisdom) (13/7—11), in

Comment:— -
'Pravrttim ca nivrttim ca jana na vidurasurah'—In the self-

willed and unrestrained environment, and due to the influence

of modern education and fooding of today people do not know,

what to do and what to refrain from. They do not want to know

it. If anyone explains it to them, they regard him as a fool, and

laugh at him. They think that they themselves are wise. Some

* Human beings possessing a demoniac nature, because of lack of fine |

breeding, do not know, what should be done and what should not be done, what

is purity and what is impurity of body, food, speech and behaviour. They do not

know the difference, between falsehood and truth. So they become disinclined 7

towards God, What is truth. Then they do not believe in God, nghteousness

(Dharma), and do not follow their ordinance. They consider the creation to

be evolved through mutual contact of men and women, brought about by lust.

Thus these atheists, inflict pain on others and themselves, suffer a downfall.
"
1786,"1732 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter16
predominance of demoniac nature, they do not translate their
knowledge, into practice. |

Now the question arises, how to know what to do, and what
‘to refrain from. These can be known through a preceptor, saints,
scriptures and thoughts. Discrimination, is also aroused in adversity,
as well as, by beholding saints and going on pilgrimages.

Every being possesses discrimination. Human beings, have the
ability and opportunity to develop it, while, other beings do not
possess ability and get an opportunity to develop discrimination. _
Birds and beasts etc., possess discrimination, which is confined
to their bodily maintenance. Human beings by applying their ~
discrimination, can rear other beings and by renouncing evil
conduct and action, can possess good conduct and perform, /
virtuous actions, as they are free in doing so, while birds and ~—
beasts etc., are not free, because they take birth, to bear the fruit
of their past actions. | |

Persons, who believe in the theory ‘eat, drink and be merry’,
do not, realize, what they should do and what they should, refrain
from. In them like animals divine nature remains concealed. The
Lord has called such persons, also 'Janah (men), because divine
nature can reveal itself, in them.

7

From the term ‘Janah' (men) (16/7), to the expression
‘Naradhaman' (worst among men), the Lord has not used any
term denoting men, in between. It means, that these men, who
in spite of having ability to renounce their demoniac nature, and
to possess divine nature, do not do so, and do not deserve to be
called, men. They are inferior to beasts and creatures, living in
hell, because they are accumulating sins, which will hurl them
into hell and the wombs of demons (16/16,19) while beasts and
creatures of hell by suffering the fruit of their sins, are moving
to higher regions.
"
1787,"Verse 7} SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 1733 :

The Lord, while describing the signs of persons endowed,
with demoniac nature, instead of using the adjectives, beastly etc.,
has used ‘Asubhan’ (impure or inauspicious) and ‘Naradhaman'

(worst among men), because they are more sinful than beasts
etc. The Lord, by using the term ‘'Narah' (man), in the twenty-
second verse of this chapter explains, that only he, who being
free from lust, anger and greed, (the three gates to hell), works
his own salvation, and deserves to be called, a man. The same
fact, has been explained, in the twenty-third verse of the fifth
chapter, by the term 'Narah’.

""Na Saucarh napi cacdro na satyam tesu vidyate'—Those who 7
are endowed with demoniac nature, have not the least idea, of -
what purity is. They do not know, how to behave with parents ;
and elders etc. They do not speak the truth and their conduct, is
impure. They do not think of truth and purity of conduct, because ~
the aim of their life, is to lead a luxurious life. So, they always
hanker after, worldly pleasure and prosperity.

The Lord, in the forty-fourth verse of the second chapter,
declares that those, who perform Vedic rites, in order to enjoy
pleasure and prosperity, cannot have the determinate intellect,
concentrated on God. Then, how can those, having a predominance

| of demoniac nature i.e., hankering after pleasure and prosperity
by foul means, have a determinate intellect, to attain Him? .

Appendix—In the order in which men are endowed with
the demoniac nature, in the same order light of discrimination
disappears. When men endowed with the demoniac nature adhere
to pleasures, they can’t know what they ought to do and what
they ought not to do. Their nistha (faith) is not even worldly, :
then no question arises of its being unworldly. Their nistha paves

. the way to hells.

The men endowed with demoniac nature look upon the

maintenance of their life-breath as the highest goal. Therefore
- they think only of their own happiness, comforts and self-interest.
"
1788,"1734 $RIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 16 }
They are inclined to perform those activities which provide them
comfort and happiness and they don’t do any activity which may
provide them pain and which do not serve their self-interest. In
fact the scripture is the authority in determining what ought to be -
done and what ought not to be done (Gita 16/24). But because
of deep attachment with their bodies and life-breaths, the men
possessing the demoniac nature, don’t obey the injunction of
the scripture, in what ought to be done and what ought not to |
be done. Because of their demoniac nature they don’t listen to -
the gospel of the scripture and even if they listen to it, they
can’t understand it—‘yatanto’pyakrtatmano nainarh pasyantya .

'Nastatmanah'—They do not believe in the existence of a

element, as such, it is merely a mixture of materialistic elements,
in it sentiency develops in the same way as a mixture of catechu -

weak. Their intellect, is concerned only with sensual pleasures. .
They believe in ‘eat, drink and be merry’. They cannot distinguish, ;
between the real and the unreal, virtue and vice, good and bad :
conduct. They have no conception of a soul or the Supreme

‘Dambhamanamadanvitah'—They are full of hypocrisy, .

pride and arrogance. They pretend to be, what they are not, in

order to gain wealth, honour, praise and prestige etc. This is -

hypocrisy. ‘Mana’ or pride, consists in regarding oneself worthy

of honour or adoration, because of one's superiority complex.

Robbers also have such resolves, because they do not want

to rob people of their riches, without injuring them. .

Obsessed lifelong with innumerable cares that end only with death,
steeped in the gratification of desires and accumulation of wealth
as the highest aim, and convinced that, that is the end-all. 11 .
Comment:—

'Cintamaparimeyam ca pralayantamupaséritah'—They are beset .
with innumerable cares, worries and anxieties, till they die. So
they have to follow, a cycle of birth and death.

The cares or worries, can be of two kinds—the spiritual
and mundane. Those, who are worried about their salvation, are
noble. But people possessing a demoniac nature, are not beset
with spiritual worries. They are obsessed with, such cares and
worries, as to how they could maintain honour, praise, fame and a
"
1793,"Verse 11] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1739 _
prestige etc., how they would live long, what would happen to :
their family, wealth and property, after their death and so on.
But the fact is, that a man is worried out of ignorance. The
Lord, provides the necessities of life to people, according to their
fortune.When a person dies, he leaves behind several things and ~
objects, unconsumed. Even a dispassionate saint leaves his loin-
cloth and a pot made of hollowed gourd, when he dies, when a
rich man dies, his riches are of no avail, to him. .
_ There is an anecdote. There was a very rich man. He built
a house of steel, like a safe, because there were so many jewels, -
ornaments and precious stones etc., in his house. The house, could :
be unlocked with a key. Once he went into the house and shut :
it, but the key was left outside. So he died, without food, water .
and air. Similarly a man suffering from a disease, cannot enjoy
delicious dishes, because if he eats such foods, he may die. -
Even dispassionate ascetics, who do not possess, even a single
penny, get the necessities of life, according to their destiny. So,
there is no need for a man to be worried, how he would earn his
living. Saint Tulasi declares, ""The Lord, first decided the destiny
of a being, and then bestowed upon him, this human body. So he -
need not worry, he should adore Him."" Similarly, another saying
goes, that the Lord provides cloth, wood and fire, even for a dead
body, so if a living man, worries about his livelihood, he is very
unfortunate. Saint Ramadasa also declares, ""An ascetic, has got
neither grain nor any animal (for milk or butter etc.,) nor cash,
but at meal-time, he receives everything."" Those possessing a
demoniac nature, do not understand this. They think, that they
obtain things, because they worry and make effort and if they :
do not do so, they may die of starvation. —
'Kamopabhogaparamah'—Those, who look upon the
gratification of desires, as their highest aim, hanker after worldly
luxuries and pleasures. They are steeped in, enjoying the objects
of the senses and in earning money, to enjoy these.
"
1794,"1740 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 16 -
'Etavaditi niscitah'—They believe, that the only aim of life /
is to enjoy worldly pleasures* and prosperity and that sensual
enjoyment, is the supreme source of happiness. They have no
belief, in the happiness of another world. According to them,
this sort of belief is a deception. They do not believe in virtues, ""
vices and rebirth etc. So they want to enjoy, as many pleasures
here, as is possible.
Appendix—The man, who is steeped in pleasures and
prosperity, becomes. blind. He can know neither the world nor
God. By regarding the unreal world as real, he can’t at all cast :
a glance upon God. He regards the non-existent world as real. -
The objects are perishable while he himself is imperishable; :
then how can the perishable gratify the imperishable? .

possessed millions of rupees, they hope to gain more and more

both will perish. , | -
Those who are bound by ties of hope and desire, cannot
stay comfortably, at one place, but those who have become free
from these ties can live at one place happily. - | -
""Kamakrodhaparayanah'—They, are given to lust and anger
ie., they harbour in their hearts, various desires for all kinds of -
sensual enjoyments. When their desires, are not gratified, they :
become angry and inflict pain, upon others. They think, that desires |
are inevitable in life, without these a man becomes lifeless, as =
a stone. Similarly, they think that they can control other beings, -
through anger and if they are not angry, other people, will get
hold of all their possessions. : :
‘Thante kamabhogarthamanyayenarthasaiicayan'—Their aim,
is to accumulate wealth and enjoy sensual pleasures. In order
to fulfil their aim, they adopt foul means, such as dishonesty, 7
cheating, treachery and injustice etc. They do not hesitate even
in usurping charity funds and properties of children and widows.
They believe that foul means, are indispensable in the world
of today. According to them, honesty and justice are merely
theoretical assumptions, which cannot be applicable, in real life.
If they are honest and just, they will have to suffer, and they will
not be able to live, from hand to mouth—such are the beliefs
of people of demoniac nature.
Those people, who hanker after heavenly pleasure and
prosperity by just means, cannot have a determinate intellect,
_ that they have to realize God (Gita 2/44). Then, how can those
people possessing a demoniac nature, who earn money by
foul and unjust means, have a determinate intellect to realize
God? But even those people are free, if they so desire through

Appendix—‘A$apaéaSatairbaddhah’—Here the term ‘Sataih’
stands for infinite (endless). So long as a man is attached to the :
world, his desires don’t come to an end. In the forty-first verse
of the second chapter the Lord declares “bahusakha hyanantasca
buddhayo’ vyavasayinam’”’. “The intellect of the undecided (infirm), :
is scattered in many directions, and is endlessly diverse”. The
reason is that they, having turned away from the imperishable, -
have cognised the reality and attached value to the perishable -
and have been attached to it.

‘Kamakrodhaparayanah’—The people endowed with demoniac -
nature think that desire and anger are inherent in human nature. .
They don’t perceive anything else beyond desire and anger. These .
two are their supreme resort. | 7

_ They hold that they will control. a person through anger.
But how long will they keep control over the person, who has
been under their control because of his helplessness? As soon as
he gets a chance, he will take vengeance upon them and harm
them. Therefore the result of anger is only bad. |

Comment:—

‘Idamadya maya labdhamimam prapsye manoratham'-—~- The
demoniac people, imagine out of greed, that they have gained so
much of money and much more will they gain, by other means, -
fair or foul. They remain engrossed in such thoughts, that the
marriage of their educated son, could bring them so much money;
so much money will be saved by evading taxes, and so much |
money, will be received, through rent and interest.

'‘Idamastidamapi me bhavisyati punardhanam'—The more -
wealth, they hoard, the more greedy, they become. They always -
think, during their daily routine from early morning till late at :
night, only of means to amass hoards of wealth, and to lead a
luxurious | life. | ""

But they forget, that they are growing old and one day, they -
will die a sad death, because they will die thinking of wealth,
which they have accumulated and which they will have to leave
behind and so wealth will cause, them grief. They, due to greed
have to be afraid of their sons and daughters etc. They are also
afraid of servants etc., lest the latter should go, on strike. -

Question:—Strivers possessing a divine nature also think of
earning money. Then, what is the difference between them and
the people, who possess a demoniac nature? /

Answer:—Though both of them seem to possess the same
disposition, yet there is a vast difference, between the two. A
striver's aim is God-realization, so he is not engrossed in hankering
after pleasure and prosperity, while a person of demoniac nature,
gets engrossed, because his aim is to enjoy worldly prosperity |
and sensual pleasure. : : :

‘kamopabhogaparamah’ (Those who are given up desire and
sensuality) used in the eleventh verse. |

People of demoniac nature, out of anger, imagine that they |

have killed a foe and they will kill other people, who are their -

‘Anima and 'Garima' etc., and can burn anyone to ashes, in a

moment. They ridicule those, who are engaged in adoration, and

meditation etc. They regard themselves, as lords of wealth, power ;

filthy hell. 16 a |
Comment:—

'Anekacittavibhranta'— People of wicked nature, are fickle .
minded. They have innumerable desires, and in order to fulfil -
them, they make many endeavours and having many a fancy. They -
do not stick to one idea, and their mind remains confused. .

'Mohajalasamavrtah'—They remain entangled,.in the snare -
of delusion, as described in the verses thirteenth to fifteenth i.e.,
they are enmeshed in vain imagination and given to lust, anger
and pride, and never get rid of these. They are trapped like
an ensnared fish. Entangled in the snare of delusion, they are —
bewildered, by many a fancy or a thought. They are afraid of -
harmful consequences, as a result of their various evil thoughts.

These thoughts are attended by such fear, as, ""We have black
money. If somehow, officials come to know of it, or clerks etc.,

may complain against us, then what will happen? We will harm .
others, but it may cause harm to us also""—thus engrossed in

such thoughts they cannot make any firm resolve. They have to
suffer a lot of pain, when their desires, remain unfulfilled.

'Prasaktah kamabhogesu'—Accumulation of wealth and .
gratification of desires, such as enjoyment of sensual pleasure
and winning honour, praise, name and fame etc., are the aim,
of their existence. | .

'Patanti narake'Sucau'— While living alive, they live in a hell
of delusion, and after death, they are condemned to frightful
hell, such as Kumbhipaka and Maharaurava, where they have
"
1801,"Verse 17] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1747
to suffer, the worst torture.*

Appendix—In fact the men of demoniac nature have already
been condemned to hells because they have been given over to
desire and anger and they are burning in the fire of the feeling
of shortages. Consequently they are doomed to dreadful hells.

- Attainment of the higher worlds or condemnation to hells
depends on a man’s thoughts rather than on his actions and

objects. Thoughts have special value. Actions are reflections
of the thoughts. Therefore the Lord has described the thoughts 2
cherished by men possessed of demoniac nature. |

Self-conceited, stubborn, filled with the pride and intoxication

Comment:—

‘Atmasambhavitah'—They are puffed up with unbounded
pride, of their wealth, honour, praise, name and fame etc. They
have a very high opinion, of their caste, social order, intellect,
learning, rank and position etc. Regarding themselves as superior

~ to others, they consider themselves worthy of their adoration.

* In the hells a being attains the body which has to suffer tortures. If
that body is broken into pieces or boiled in oil or burnt in fire, it does not die
so long as the being does not reap the fruit of his evil actions.
"
1802,"1748 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 16 |
'‘Stabdha'—They are too arrogant, to behave politely even
with saints and an incarnation of God and to bow to these. If
under unavoidable circumstances, they have to bow to their
superiors, they bow to them haughtily. -
‘Dhanamanamadanvitah'—They remain intoxicated with, the
wine of wealth and pride. They are proud of their acquaintance,
with people who hold high ranks and positions. They rely on -
riches and on their status. They think, that they have such
resources, that they can acquire anything they desire, and they |
can destroy anyone, as they have an approach, with high officials ;
and ministers. -
""Yajante namayajiiaiste dambhena'—They perform ostentatious |
sacrifices, in order to, win honour, name and fame. They feed
people of the priestly class, with meagre food, and show that -
they have fed them with rich and delicious dishes.
| They perform sacrifices, and offer charity, without paying
attention to scriptural ordinances, only to influence people. They
decorate temples and conduct special religious celebrations, for
pomp and show, and self advertisement, when some distinguished 7
dignitaries visit a temple. This sort of worship, in temples is
actually, not for adoration but for gaining name and fame, or
for pleasing officers, for their own self-interest.
The operaters of cowpens feed the healthy cows properly,
but underfeed the crippled, disabled and dry cows. Moreover, _ -
they misuse funds, for their selfish motive. They make a lot of
collections, but spend only little, to run religious institutions and
use such funds for their own family expenses. ,
Even strivers, observe hypocrisy. They engage themselves
in meditation, adoration and telling the beads of a rosary etc.,
when they see anyone coming, otherwise, they remain engaged’ -
in playing cards and worldly gossips etc. All this hypocrisy, is
to win honour, name, praise and money.
When there is ostentation, even in strivers, what can be said,
"
1803,"Verse 18] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1749 .
about ostentation of people possessing demoniac nature?
'Avidhipirvakam'—They act against scriptural ordinances.
They perform sacrifices, without reverence and faith. Similarly,
they offer charity to the, undeserving. They view, all things in .
a perverted way (Gita 18/32). :
Appendix—The people, endowed with the demoniac nature, _
are jealous of others and they perform sacrifices in order to .
show that they are in no way inferior to others, rather they
are superior to them. They perform sacrifices in order to win ;
name and fame, they don’t believe in its reward. If anyone else ;
performs a sacrifice, they think that he also does it in order to =
win name and fame. Having no faith in God and in the other
world, they disregard scriptural ordinances. Only those people :
who believe in God and in the next world and also believe that -
a particular action will bring a particular result, care for the
scriptural ordinance. :
All the activities of the demoniac natured people are
ostentatious. But they take the pride within, that their sacrifice
will be far better than that of others. Being proud of their learning ~
they consider themselves as learned and wise and regard others
as foolish and ignorant. In fact they live in a fool’s paradise.

People.:possessing wicked nature, are given to egoism, force,
arrogance, lust and anger. They depend on these propensities, in
the same way, as devotees depend on God. They believe, that
a person without these propensities, is humiliated and crushed.
So, they cultivate these and perpetuate them, so that they may :
win honour, praise, name and fame, and may keep other people
under control. _ |
‘Mamatmaparadehesu pradvisantah'—The Lord says, that those
people hate Him Who dwells in their own bodies, as well as, in
the bodies of others. The ordinances of seriptures and jurisprudence ;
(Smrtis), are His own ordinances. Those thus disobey Him, and -
are malicious against Him, are thrown into hell. They despise
the Lord, in two ways. First they do not obey the voice of their
conscience, which tells them what is right and what is wrong. _
Secondly, they despise, insult and distress other people, who are
none other than, the manifestations of the Lord.
'Abhyasiiyakah’—These malicious people, find fault with Him,
as well as, with others. They say, that the Lord 1s partial, because
He protects the devotees, and destroys the wicked. They are -
_ jealous of saints and ascetics, who are virtuous and they believe,
that all saints, ascetics, devotees and strivers, also possess vile
propensities, such as attachment, aversion, lust, anger, selfishness |
and ostentation etc. They oppose, adoration, meditation, fasts and :
pilgrimages etc., declaring these as futile pursuits, which bear
no sweet fruit, because they themselves, have received nothing
out of them. They have merely wasted, their time. Thus, those |
demoniac people, follow a path, contrary to the right one. a
Appendix—The men endowed with demoniac nature are very
obstinate and they adopt a stubborn attitude in what they believe
to be true. This is the principle that only the man who is sad
himself, causes sadness to others. The men of demoniac nature
remain afflicted with sorrows, so they cause sufferings to others
also. They don’t perceive virtues in others but perceive evils in

Comment:— | | -
'Tanaham dvisatah kriransamsaresu naradhaman'—The =
demoniac nature, (described in the fifteenth verse of the seventh
chapter and the twelfth verse of the ninth chapter) has been -
explained in detail, from the seventh verse to the eighteenth verse
of this chapter. Now, (concluding this topic in the nineteenth
and the twentieth verses of the chapter) the Lord declares, that
such people who bear malice for other people, and are bent -
upon doing ill to them, and possessing a demoniac nature, are
very cruel. They take delight in, committing violence. They
are the worst of men, because the beings dwelling in hell, are
becoming pure, after receiving the fruits of their evil deeds, while -
they by committing cruel deeds, are paving their way to hell.
Therefore, in the Ramacaritamanasa, it is mentioned, that it is
better to reside in hell than to have the company of wicked or
vile persons, because their company creates such seeds, which :
are not destroyed even after getting, their fruits in hell and |
eighty-four lac forms, of lives.
The Lord, has declared that desire is the root of all
sins (3/37). When a man has a desire to earn more money, he
adopts wrong means, such as falsehood, fraud and knavery and
even commits sins, such as smuggling and robbery, and does not
"
1806,"1752 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter16
even hesitate to commit murder. Thus, he becomes more and
more cruel. So, he has to bear pain in the wombs of demons,
and also in foul hell.
‘Ksipamyajasramasubhanasurisveva yonisu'—To call these -
- people, by their name, to see them and to remember them, is
very unholy. Such people are called 'Asubhan' (evil-doers). The
Lord, hurls such cruel persons, according to their nature, into
the wombs of demons i.e., He sends them, into the wombs of
cruel beings such as dogs, tigers, lions, snakes and scorpions
etc., not only once, but again and again so that they may be -
purged of their sins. . | -
Actually every being is a fragment of God, and so man is His.
The Lord is a disinterested friend, of all beings. So by regarding —~
these as His own, He despatches them into the wombs of cruel _
beings, to purify them of all their sins. Thus, being purified
they, may attain eternal bliss or salvation. He is different from
_ other friends and kinsmen, who provide comfort and luxuries to
a man whom they regard as their own and enable him to get
entangled, in worldly pleasures. -
As a good teacher, punishes a pupil, so that he may become
learned, the most merciful Lord, throws even atheists into wombs
of demons, so that they may be purified of their sins, and attain
salvation, because He regards them, as His own. |

Comment:— oe | oe

'Asurim yonimapanna midha janmani janmani mamaprapyaiva
kaunteya'—In the preceding verse, the Lord declared, that He
sends persons possessing demoniacal nature, into the lower class _
of wombs of beasts and birds. Here also, He declares, that in this
human life they have got a rare opportunity of God-realization,
yet instead of realizing Him, they go into the wombs of demons,
and again and again, go on taking birth im demoniacal wombs.

By the term 'Mamaprapyaiva', the Lord means that He ;
regrets for His act of bestowing that human body, on a being.
He had offered the human body, in order to enable him, to attain ~
salvation. But, he had proved treacherous, because he, instead of
attaining salvation, sank down, to a still lower plane. . :

A being, during this human life, even though of the most -
vile conduct, swiftly may become a soul of righteousness and
attain, eternal peace (Gita 9/30-31) and even at the time of death,
may attain the Lord (Gita 8/5). The reason is, that the Lord is
the same for all beings, (Gita 9/29) and so He has provided an
opportunity to all beings, to attain Him. Birds and beasts, because -
of their undeveloped discrimination, cannot attain Him, but there
is no restriction from the Lord, even for them. So the Lord is
very sad, when He sees that human beings, instead of availing
a golden opportunity to attain salvation, sink to lower planes. -

'Tato yantyadhamam gatim'-—'Their sins, do not totally perish
even during demoniac births. So, they have to go to still lower
planes viz., hells. | _

Here, a doubt arises as to why the Lord has said, that these .
deluded beings do not attain Him, but sink down to a still lower
plane, when there is no opportunity for them, to realize Him, in
the demoniac birth. The clarification is, that the Lord has said
so, because man was given an opportunity to realize Him, in
the human life, before his demoniac birth, but he did not avail
of that opportunity. Hence, he gets a demoniac birth. It means,
"
1808,"1754 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 16 ,
that human beings, instead of attaining Him, first fall into the
wombs of demons, and then sink down to still lower planes of

foul hells; such as 'Kumbhipaka’ etc.

The Lord bestows this human body, upon a being, so that a
man may attain salvation. But he being overpowered by desires, .
selfishness and pride, commits sins, such as robbery, knavery,

- treachery and violence, which result in outward fruit and
inward influence. A person, has to suffer according to evil .
actions, of the past. But, those, who inflict pain on him, commit ~
new sins, which will bear painful fruits. Moreover, the sins leave
their impression on the ego. That is very disastrous, because :
that impression in the form of evil feelings, instigates him to -
commit sins, again and again. Therefore, unless and until, a man
attains salvation viz., unless he dispels these evil feelings from
his ego, these will induce him, to resort to evil actions here, and
hereafter, and will lead him to demoniac wombs and foul hell,
where he will have to suffer torture. 7

Among the demoniac beings, such as beasts, birds, ghosts,
insects and moths etc., also, it is seen that some of them are
more cruel, while others are milder, according to the nature of
their previous birth. Even when the Lord by His grace bestows
upon them a human body, desire (lust)-and anger persist in their
ego which are the impressions, of previous birth. The marks of
those, who return from hell, are excessive anger, harsh or bitter
speech, poverty, enmity towards kinsmen, company of the mean |
and service, for the mean. Similarly, those who perform virtuous
actions, to attain heaven, go to heaven. There, they enjoy the
vast heaven, as fruit of their virtuous actions, but their nature

does not undergo, any change. The four marks of those returning
from heaven, are—{1) inclination towards offering charity,
(2) sweet speech, (3) adoration for the gods, and (4) efforts to
"
1809,"Verse 21] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1755 :
satisfy members of.the priest class. A being, can change his :
nature, only during this human life. |
Link:—The Lord, in the preceding verse, declared that .
people of demoniac nature, instead of attaining to Him, fall
into the wombs of demons and then sink down to a still lower
plane. The Lord, in the next verse, gives the reason why, first
they fall into the demoniac wombs, and then sink down to a
still lower plane.

Comment:—
'‘Kamah krodhastatha lobhah trividham narakasyedamh
dvaram'—The Lord, in the fifth verse, declared that divine
nature is conducive to liberation and the demoniacal, to bondage.
Then what is the root of demoniac nature? Desire, for worldly :
pleasures, prosperity, honour, praise and comforts etc., is the root
of demoniac nature, which leads human beings to hell. Desire,
anger, greed, delusion, intoxication of wealth (arrogance), and
jealousy have been regarded, as the six enemies. Out of these
Six enemies, in the Gita, also there is mention of three—desire, :
anger and greed; while at some place, there is mention of two
only attachment and aversion;-while at some other place only
desire, has been declared, as the enemy of strivers. All the six
are practically of the same nature. Out of these, desire is the.
root which binds a man (Gita 5/12). :
"
1810,"1756 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 16 .
In the thirty-sixth verse of the third chapter, Arjuna asked :
Lord Krsna, ""By what, is a man impelled to commit sin, as if by
force, even against his will?"" The Lord, replied that it is desire,
which is later transformed into wrath, and is an all-devouring,
sinful enemy. When desire, is not fulfilled, it gives birth to wrath. .
But,. here in this verse desire (lust), anger and greed have been |
mentioned, as three enemies. It means, that an inclination towards
pleasure is desire (lust), and inclination towards accumulation,
is greed. Where, only the term ‘Kama’ (desire), is given, it also
includes desire for pleasure and accumulation of riches. But, when
both the terms ‘Kama’ (desire) and 'Lobha’ (greed), are quoted -
independently, the term ‘Kama’ stands for desire for pleasure, -
while ‘Lobha’ stands for desire for accumulation. When, there -
is any obstruction, in the fulfilment of these inclinations, anger :
springs. When there is an excess of desire, anger and greed,
delusion is born. . -
From desire, arises anger and from anger delusion (Gita 2/62-63).
If desire is fulfilled, it gives birth to greed, and from greed comes
delusion. In fact, it is desire which is transformed into anger and
greed. Delusion, leads to the mode of ignorance and then perfect
demoniac nature, prevails. -
""NaSanamatmanah'—Desire, anger and greed, degrade a
man. Those, who hanker after worldly pleasure and prosperity,
regard these three evil propensities, as conducive to their welfare.
But, actually a man who falls a prey to these faces degradation
or ruination.
'Tasmadetattrayarn tyajet'—When a person, comes to know that
desire, anger and greed, are three gates to hell, he should renounce,
these. How to renounce them? The Lord, in the thirty-fourth
verse of the third chapter, has declared that attachment (desire) .
and aversion (anger) through the feeling of agreeableness and
disagreeableness abide, in the objects of senses but a striver should
not come under their sway i.e., he should not perform any action,
against the ordinance of scriptures, being overpowered by desire,
anger and greed. If a man comes under their sway, he is ruined.
"
1811,"Verse 22] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1757 -
Appendix—tThe sense of enjoying pleasures is ‘lust’ and the |
sense of accumulation is ‘greed’. If anyone causes an obstruction
in the fulfilment of lust and greed, then anger ensues. These three
are the root causes of the demoniac nature and they cause all sins. |
At the time of death, persons and objects are left behind but :
the demoniac nature of a man paves his way to hells.

The man freed from the three gates to hell, pursues his salvation
and then attains the Supreme Goal, O son of Kunti (Arjuna). 22
Comment:—
'Etairvimuktah kaunteya tamodvaraistribhirnarah _
dcaratyatmanah éreyastato yati pararn gatim'—Desire, anger and
greed, which were termed the gates of hell in the preceding verse,
have been called the gates to darkness, in this verse. Darkness is
born of ignorance (Gita 14/8). A man, swayed by the gates of hell, -
never thinks ""These riches, wife, family and friends, were neither
with me, nor will remain in future, and at present also they are
separating from me. If I have a sense of mine, with them, I may
be damned."" It means, that desire for prosperity, pleasure and
other worldly things, which are transitory and perishable, leads, |
a man to darkness. He does not think of the consequences, of his
attachment for them. But, he who having been free from desire
etc., practises what is good for him, attains the Supreme Goal.
So a striver, should be cautious, against desire, anger and greed.
A striver, practises spiritual discipline, to purify himself of
"
1812,"1758 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter16  —
evil feelings, and evil conduct, but he does not pay attention

to evil propensities, such as. desire (lust) and greed etc., which

he possesses. So a striver, should be on guard against these.
Moreover, he should think of the Lord with form or without
form from early morning, till late at night, and from the day he
has realized His importance, to the time of death.

The term, 'Etairvimuktah’ (liberated from these), does not
mean, that a striver after being free from evil conduct, should _
follow spiritual discipline. But it means, that a striver having the
aim of God-realization, should try to be free from desire, anger, —
greed and other evil propensities. It is because of these propensities,  _
that a striver, commits sins and does not progress spiritually. In
fact, a man (soul) being a ftagment of God, is sentient, pure and -
naturally, a store of bliss, but his inclination towards the world, _
has resulted in impurity in him, so if he develops a disinclination,
towards the world, he would naturally, make spiritual progress.

The expression 'Sreyah dcarati' (practises what is good) means,
that a striver should perform only prescribed actions, and not
prohibited ones. He should not translate, the evil propensities —_-
(such as desire or lust and anger), into practice. He should try
his best to be free, from them. If he finds that his efforts are
going in vain, he should invoke the Lord, and pray to Him to
liberate him from these evils. Gosvami Tulasidasa prays, to -
God, ""O Lord, my heart is Your residence, but several thieves
(evils), have settled there. I request them to leave it. But they
want to reside there, forcibly"" (Vinaya Patrika 125/2-3). It means,
that he is unable to be free, from these evils. So he seeks refuge
in Him, so that He may protect him, from these. .

Appendix—‘Etairvimuktah’—To be free from desire, anger
and greed means—to have the aim to renounce them and not
to be swayed by them. Even the virtuous action performed out
of desire, anger or greed, is not conducive to salvation. So a
striver should be very careful to renounce them. Even the virtuous
"
1813,"Verse 23] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1759 “
conduct, such as chanting the Lord’s holy names and meditating
on Him, does not lead to salvation, unless the striver renounces
them, because they are the root causes of sins (Gita 3/37).

It is because of desire, anger and greed that righteousness and ”
ethical propriety of the society are lost; which is very harmful for
the world. The men of demoniac nature are steeped in desires,
anger and greed. They perform virtuous actions such as religious
sacrifice and offer charity for mere ostentation, not for salvation.
But the strivers of divine nature, instead of being overpowered .
by desire, anger and greed, perform virtuous actions for their ;
salvation, which naturally involves the welfare of the world. -
The: men of demoniac nature are envious of such strivers and
they think them to be senseless (foolish); but these strivers take
pity on those men of demoniac disposition and pray to God to -
provide them with good sense (moral sense).

in an arbitrary way, according to their sweet will* disobeying
the ordinances of scriptures. The reason, is that they attach
| importance only to the seemingly good activities. They do not.
_ bother to get rid of their evil feelings. —_

Though they have evil feelings, yet they are proud of their
outward good actions. It is because, of their pride, that their
virtues are transformed into evil, their glory into blame, and their
renunciation into attachment, and pleasure, which lead them to their |
downfall and ruin. It is because of their internal evil feelings, that —_-
they act in an arbitrary way, according to their own sweet will. -

A patient, intends to discard unwholesome diet, and plans to
take wholesome food. But out of attachment, takes unwholesome
diet, which worsens his disease, similarly, people from their ~-
own view-point, make an attempt to perform good actions.

But evils—desire, anger and greed take them under their sway
and they act in an arbitrary way, disregarding the ordinance of
scriptures and are thus, damned.

""Na sa siddhimavapnoti'—Those, possessing demoniac nature, -
perform supposedly good actions, such as religious sacrifice etc.,
casting aside the ordinances of scriptures. Thus they may attain
benefits, like wealth, and honour etc., but they do not attain
perfection, in the form of purity of heart. |

""Na sukham'—They do not attain Sattvika happiness because

* (A) Here in the verse the expression ‘Kamakaratah’' denotes one's own
unrestrained self-will while in the expression ‘Kamakarena’ used in the twelfth
verse of the fifth chapter there is desire for pleasures. The former looks at
the actions while the latter looks at the fruit of the action. But ‘Kama’ (Desire)
is the root in both of them. Oo ae

(B) Here a point needs attention that in this chapter from the seventh
verse to the twenty-third verse the term 'Kama' (Desire) has been used nine
times in the context of the demoniac nature (16/8, 16/10, 11, 12, 12, 16, 18,

21, 23) (in 12 verse two times each). It means that desire is the root of the
demoniac nature. a

in their hearts the burning feeling of desire and anger, etc.,
persists. They may derive pleasure, born of contact with objects,
which are only sources of sorrow (Gita 5/22). —

'Na param gatim'—They do not attain the Supreme Goal, 7
because firstly they do not believe in it. Moreover, their actions,
performed out of desire, anger and greed, are not conducive to
attainment, of the Supreme Goal. |

Their acts are good. So they can attain perfection, happiness
and the Supreme Goal. But they do not attain these, because -
they possess evil propensities, such as desire (lust), anger, greed :
and pride, which are stumbling blocks, in their attainment. It =
is because of these evil propensities, that their good actions,
generally convert into evil and vice. Therefore, they do not get all -
these things. Had their activities been evil, by nature, then there -
would have not been any question of their attaining, perfection,
happiness and the Supreme Goal.

Appendix—People of demoniac nature, because of their
pride, regard themselves as perfect and happy——‘siddho’harh
balavansukhi’ (Gita 16/14) but actually they are never perfect ;
and happy—‘na sa siddhimavapnoti na sukharh’. Their hearts
burn with the fire of pride and malice.

what ought to be done and what ought not to be. Having known |
what is prescribed in the ordinance of scriptures, thou shouldst
act accordingly in this world. 24 - |
Comment:— _
'Tasmacchastram pramanam te karyakaryavyavasthitau'— ;
Those, who are attached to their life-breath, do not know what
should be done, and what should be refrained from. So, they are
specially inclined towards demoniac nature.Therefore, Lord Krsna,
advises Arjuna to act according to the ordinance of scripture. :
The conduct and words, of saints and great souls, are also ~
based on scripture. So obedience to these, is also obedience
to the ordinances of the scripture, because they have become __
saints and great souls, by following the ordinances of scripture. -
In fact, the ordinances of scriptures are the ideas, precepts, and __
principles, and acts of God-realized souls. |
The expression 'Sastrarn pramanam', means that a person, who
wants to attain eternal bliss, should readily renounce whatever is
prohibited by the scripture, and accept what is ordained by it.
'Jiiatva Sastravidhanoktarh karma kartumiharhasi'* — People = -
of demoniac nature, do not know, what to do and what to refrain
from (Gita 16/7). So, they do not attain perfection. Lord Krsna
says to Arjuna, that he should act, according to ordinances of
the scripture, because he possesses the divine nature. ""
First, Arjuna thought, that sin alone would accrue to him,
by killing his kinsmen in the battle. So the Lord declared,
""Happy are the Ksatriyas (members of the warrior class), who
are called upon to fight, in such a battle that comes of itself, as
an open door to heaven"" (Gita 2/32). Here, the Lord says that
he should discharge his duty,. according to the ordinance of the
scripture, because it cannot lead him to bondage. An act, which

which has been bestowed upon him in order to realize God by performing
noble actions. | |

"
1817,"Verse 24] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1763 -
is performed with selfishness and pride, leads to bondage while
the action which is performed in an arbitrary way against the
ordinance of scriptures, leads to ruin.

One's own duty of fighting in the battle, seems one of cruelty
and violence, but actually a Ksatriya doing his duty incurs no
sin (Gita 18/47). It means, that a person who discharges his
duty in accordance with the ordinance of scriptures, incurs no sin.
He incurs sin, only when he performs actions, with selfishness
and pride, in order to harm others. .

Human life, 1s successful only, when a person without being -
attached to the body and life-breath, performs actions according 7
to ordinances of scriptures, for God-realization. -

Appendix—The Lord in the seventh verse declared that the _
people of demoniac nature don’t know what to do and what to
refrain from. Here the Lord declares that their demoniac nature will
be wiped out by acting according to the ordinance of the scripture.

Here a doubt may arise how will the people, who have not
studied the scripture, know what to do? The clarification is that -
if they aim at salvation, they themselves will know what to do,
because necessity is the mother of invention. But if they don’t
aim at salvation, even having studied the scripture, they will not
know what to do; on the contrary their ignorance will thrive on the .
assumption that they have a very good knowledge of scriptures.

Seventeenth Chapter |

| INTRODUCTION :

The Lord, in thé twenty-third verse of the sixteenth
chapter, declared that he, who having cast aside the ordinances .
of scriptures, acts in an arbitrary way, according to his sweet
will, attains neither perfection nor happiness, nor the Supreme |
Goal. Listening to the Lord's statement, Arjuna thinks that only
a few people know those ordinances. A majority of people do -
not know these ordinances, but they worship the gods according
to their caste, social order (asrama), family tradition and innate -
faith. Due to their disregard for the ordinances of the scriptures, _
they should be regarded as demoniac, but due to their faith,
they could be considered men of divine traits. So Arjuna wants
to know, where such people stand. Therefore, he puts a question
to Lord Krsna, in the first verse.*

* To treat this (seventeenth) chapter as an explanation of the twenty-seventh
verse of the ninth chapter (Whatever you do and whatever you offer, do that
as an offering to Me) is not reasonable because the twenty-seventh verse of
the ninth chapter is included in the topic ‘offerings to God’ which begins from
the twenty-sixth verse and is concluded in the twenty-eighth verse with the
result of these offerings. But here is the topic of faith.

tHere the topic is based on the twenty-third verse of the sixteenth
chapter because in both the verses there is the mention of ‘having cast aside
the ordinances of the scriptures’. Instead of ‘under the impulse of desire’ here
the expression ‘endowed with faith’ has been used; similarly instead of ‘acts’ the
expression ‘performs sacrifice’ and instead of ‘attains neither perfection, nor .
happiness nor the Supreme Goal’ the sentence ""What is their position—Sattva,
Rajas or Tamas have been used.

of the Gita, in the form of the dialogue, between Lord Krsna and -
Arjuna, is for the welfare of all beings. Both of them, had people
of the Kali age in view, because the Dvapara age, was coming
to an end. So Arjuna thinking of the people of Kali age, asks -
Lord Krsna, the position: of those who have good feelings and
are also endowed with faith, but they have not acquired accurate _
and elaborate knowledge of scriptures.* So, they disregard the

ordinances of scriptures, through ignorance. People in general,
will have little knowledge, of the scriptures. Moreover, it will ;
be difficult for them to get company of saints and great souls,
as they will be rare in Kali age. In spite of their being rare,
if anyone wants to get their company, he can have it. But the |
trouble is, that in Kali age several hypocrites, disguise themselves
as saints. Thus, it becomes difficult.to recognize them. So it
becomes very difficult to have company of real saints, and to
derive benefit from them. Therefore, such people neither know
the ordinance of scriptures nor have the association of saints
and great souls. But, they worship gods and perform austerities,
with innate faith. So Arjuna asks, about their position. Is it, of
goodness, passion or of ignorance?

is included in divine nature, while the modes of raja (passion)
and tama (ignorance) are included in demoniac nature. The
mode of passion, resembles the mode of ignorance, in certain
respects.* In the sixty-second and sixty-third verses of the second
chapter in the Gita, it is mentioned, that anger springs from
desire, which is a mode of passion, while from anger arises
delusion, the mode of ignorance. Similarly, in the twenty-seventh ;
verse of the eighteenth chapter, a doer, who is swayed by sorrow
and who is given to violence, is said to be passionate, while in .
the twenty-fifth verse of the same chapter, violence has been .
called, a mark of the. mode of ignorance, and in the thirty-fifth -
verse, sorrow, a mark of firmness of the mode of ignorance.
Thus several signs of the mode of ignorance and of passion, :
are similar. SO a 7 OO _
Sattvika feelings, thoughts and conduct, are included in
divine nature, while the rajasika and tamasika, are included in
demoniac nature. A man's position, is decided. in accordance
with, his nature. Here, by the term 'position’, Arjuna wants to
know what is the fate of such a man, as he also asked, in the -
thirty-seventh verse of the sixth chapter. .
Here, Arjuna addresses the Lord as Krsna (One who attracts).
He wants to ask, of what status, He will consider such a man ;
i.e., what is his status and what is his end.
Now a question arises, whether the Lord attracts persons, or
whether they are attracted, according to the fruit of their actions.
The answer is, that a man receives the fruit of his actions, but
the controller of those fruits, is the Lord. He awards the fruits, |
according to their action. But, being a disinterested friend of all,
He throws them into hell, to purify them, of their sins, and then
* Sattvaguna (the mode of goodness) is ten times superior to the Rajoguna
(the mode of passion) while the mode of passion is ten times superior to the
Tamoguna (the mode of ignorance). It means that the mode of goodness is a
hundred times superior to the mode of ignorance. | |

he attracts all of them, towards Him. So the Lord says, for the
people of demoniac nature, that those deluded beings, instead
of attaining Him, go down to lower planes (16/20). It means,
that the Lord is sad, when he sees. that human beings, instead -
of attaining Him, go down to lower states. . |

of nature, is of three kinds—sattvika (good), rajasa (passionate)
and tamasa (ignorant). Lord Krsna, asks Arjuna to hear about
these three, from Him. . |
In the preceding verse, in the expression ‘Sattvamaho -
rajastamah,’ the conjunction 'Aho' (Or), has been used, which
denotes that according to Arjuna 'sattvam' (good), stands for
divine nature, while rajastamah'’ (passionate-ignorant) stand, -
for demoniac nature. It means, that according to him, there are
only two divisions. As far as bondage is concerned, the Lord |
also includes both the rajas and the tamas, in demoniac nature, -
when he declares that demoniac nature is conducive to bondage -
(Gita 16/5). But, there is a difference between the two—the
rajas and the tamas. The rajasa (passionate) people, perform
actions, according to ordinance of scriptures to get their fruit. _
So having enjoyed, in heaven the heavenly pleasure, they enter
(return to) the world of mortals, when their merit is exhausted
(Gita 9/21). But the tamasa (ignorant) people do not perform
actions, according to ordinances of the scripture. So they sink
deep (Gita 14/18). Thus the Lord, divides the faith of people, -
possessing a demoniac nature, into two parts, the rajas and the
tamas, and asks Arjuna to hear from him, of the three kinds of
faith— sattvika, rajasa and tamasa, separately.

kinds of faith. In the next verse, He explains, why it is of three
kinds. |

Comment:— CO e —

‘Sattvanuriipa sarvasya Sraddha bhavati bharata'—Here, the -
expression 'Sattvanurapa’ stands for ‘Svabhavaja', which was used
in the preceding verse. The term 'Sattva’, stands for inner sense.

So the faith of a man is in accordance with his inner sense. As a .
man's inner sense is sattvika, rajasa or tamasa, so is his faith.

The term 'Sarvasya’, denotes 'dehinam’ (the embodied), used _
in the preceding verse. It means, that the faith of each person, :
whether he knows the ordinances of the scriptures or not, believes :
in them or not, acts, according to them or not and he may belong
to any caste, creed, country, social order, of any tradition but, ;
faith of each and all is of three kinds. | -

'‘Sraddhamayo'yam purusah'— A man's character is judged,
by his faith. As a man's faith is, so is his character. |

""Yo yacchraddhah sa eva sah'— As a man's faith, is so is
his 'Nistha’, (state of being, conviction) and according to his
conviction is his fate. His feelings and actions, are according to -
his faith. So long as, he maintains affinity with the world, he is
the same as is his nature or his inner sense.

A man is inclined towards the world by regarding it, as
true, while he is inclined towards God, by having faith in Him.
Without faith a man, cannot progress in the spiritual sphere,
whether he follows the discipline of action, of knowledge or |
of devotion.

Faith, occupies an important place in a man's life. As a
man's faith is, so is he (17/3). He may not be so today, but in
the course of time, he will become so.

Today, it is difficult for a striver, to recognize his natural
faith, because there are innumerable sects and religions. Having
"
1825,"Verse 3] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI | 1771 a
read and heard, different opinions and principles, he finds himself
in a fix. He cannot decide, what his aim is, and what. he should
do. In such circumstances, he should give a serious thought, to his
internal feelings which are untainted by any external influences,
of association, of a preceptor or scriptures. Thus he comes to /
know, of his natural inclination or faith.

Every being, has an inclination to be free from all SOITOWS,
and to attain eternal bliss. This inclination, is aroused in human :
beings, because of their past influences, present education,
environment and heredity. They make their decisions, according ~
to their inclination or nature. This resolution, decides their faith. -
Sattvika faith, leads to spirituality, while the tamasa and rajasa .
ones lead to the mundane world. So, the sattvika faith is spiritual, -
while the tamasa and the rajasa faiths, are mundane Le., the _
sattvika faith is divine nature, while the tamasa and the rajasa
faiths, imply demoniac nature. The seventeenth chapter, has been
started in order to enable people to renounce demoniac nature,
and to reveal divine nature. The reason, is that those who want
to attain salvation, should renounce the demoniac nature and .
should acquire divine one. | |

The faith of the people, who want to attain salvation is
sattvika, of those who want mundane pleasures, prosperity and
also heaven etc., is rajasa and of those who believe in 'eat, drink
and be merry’ as well as in indolence, heedlessness and excessive
sleep etc., is tamasa. Faith consists, in the acceptance of the
existence of God and in His realization. Where there is faith,
love reveals itself naturally, because the soul is a fragment of |
God. So, as soon as, one develops faith, he is attracted towards
Him. When having a disinclination, for the Lord, he remains
absorbed in worldly pleasures and prosperity, believing in the
mundane. This sort of faith or belief, is not real, it is a misuse
of faith. This mundane faith, leads to a downfall. The faith, that
he belongs to a particular caste(varna) and a particular social
"
1826,"1772 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 17 .
order (aSrama), is a higher sort of faith, than mundane faith.

But, the best and the real faith, is the faith in God, saints,
liberated souls and scriptures. Such faith leads to salvation.*

Those, who have neither knowledge of scriptures, nor
company of the great souls, can also have faith in spirituality |
or God, because of the impressions sarhskara of the past. Such
people naturally believe in God, and are engaged in virtuous
actions, such as religious sacrifice, charity, austerity, pilgrimage,
fast, good company and study of scriptures etc. Even if they do :
not perform such virtuous acts, their faith can be recognized, by _
the sattvika food, they eat. . -

All beings, such as human beings, birds, beasts, plants and
creepers etc., whether moving or not assumed someone as superior -
to them and depend upon him or it. When adversity visits them, -
all take shelter in someone, who is superior to them. He, who
has deemed anyone superior to him, and taken shelter in him,
he may believe in God or not, he has, in fact accepted God,
in principle. He, who goes on viewing superiority of one, over
another, in respect of age, learning, quality, wisdom, ability, :
power and status etc., he will have to accept, finally the most
superior One of whom, there is no superior. All superiority, ends
in Him and He is God.

‘Purvesamapi guruh kalenanavacchedat' .

(Yogadarsana 1/26)

“He is the preceptor of the most ancient ancestors, because
He is above, a time limit.”

Everybody concedes, someone or the other, as superior to :
him, from his view-point. This faith in superiority, is according
to feelings of his inner sense. These feelings constitute his faith.

These feelings, remain different in different persons. So their

*In the mundane faith there is predominance of pleasures, in the religious

faith there is predominance of feeling and in the spiritual faith there is
- predominance of the truth.
"
1827,"Verse 3] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1773 -
faith is also, distinct. , oe . ,

A man's faith is sattvika, rajasa or tamasa, according to
his nature. All beings, are endowed with the three modes. of
nature—sattvika, rajasika or tamasika (Gita 18/40). One of :
them may predominate the other two (Gita 14/10), in every being.

As nature always undergoes changes, so its modes also change.

So a striver, whose aim is God-realization, without assuming |

any affinity, with modes of nature, should remain unperturbed,

by them. |
_ The soul is a fragment of God. So when a man, finds :

predominance of a mode either of passion or of ignorance, he

should not regard himself, as mean or low. Being a fragment

of God, he (soul), is pure. It is his company or environment, by

which one mode of nature predominates, by suppressing the other -

two. As the nature of a man is, so 1s his faith—sattvika, rajasa

or tamasa. So a striver, should keep good (sattvika) company,

should live in good environment, and should study the scriptures.

By doing so, his nature and faith, will be sattvika (good) and

these will lead him, to salvation. On the other hand, by bad -

company, environment and literature, his faith will be rajasika |

or tamasika, which will degrade him.

Appendix—Faith is a ‘bhava’ (sentiment). As is a man’s
sentiment, so is his self. The bhava (sentiment) is of two -
kinds—‘sadbhava’ and ‘asadbhava’. The one which leads to God,
is ‘sadbhava’ and the one which leads to the world is ‘asadbhava’.

In the divine nature there is predominance of ‘sadbhava’ while

in demoniac nature, there is predominance of ‘asadbhava’. |
‘I am a striver’-—In it if there is the predominance of

‘asadbhava’, it causes pride (false pride) and if there is

predominance of ‘sadbhava’, it causes ‘svabhimana’ (Self-

respect). Pride causes demoniac nature but Self-respect causes

divine nature. If a man thinks that he is superior to others, he

becomes proud of his superiority; and if a striver thinks of his
"
1828,"1774 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA , {Chapter 17 -
duty, he is full of Self-respect that he can’t perform any action
which is an obstacle to his spiritual progress. Being proud a man
can perform an action contrary to his spiritual practice; but if
the striver has Self-respect, he will feel shy in performing any _
action which 1s contrary to his spiritual discipline. ‘Svabhimana’
will lead him to the ‘Sattvika’ faith while ‘Abhimana’ (pride)
will lead him to the ‘Rajasika’ and “Tamasika’ faiths. | |

Good (sattvika) men worship the gods; the passionate (rajasika)

Comment:—
'Yajante sattvika devan'—The sattvika (good) — people, |
possessing divine nature, worship the gods. Here, the term ‘Devan’
denotes the five chief deities—Visnu (the preserver), (Rama or
Krsna etc.), Siva (the destroyer), Ganesa, Durga (Power) and
the Sun, because the term 'Deva’, stands for God (Divinity) and »
His nature viz., divine nature, which is conducive to liberation .
(16/5). Thus, strivers possessing the sattvika (good) faith worship,
anyone of five chief deities, according to their natural faith. The
worship of twelve Adityas, eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, and two
Aévini Kumaras, without any selfish motive, is also regarded as
sattvika worship. _ a | 7

and the demons. They are included among the gods. The gnomes,
hanker after the accumulation of wealth, and then guard it,
while the demons are bent upon the destruction, of others. The
passionate, worship them, to satisfy their own desires and to
destroy others, = = — © | ,

| ‘Pretanbhitaganamscanye yajante tamasa janah'—The
ignorant people, worship spirits and ghosts. Those, who are
dead are called 'Preta', while those who are in the forms of the -
life of ghosts, are 'Bhuta’. : ,

Here, the manes should not be included in the term ‘Preta' ~
(spirit), because those, who worship the manes as a part of their -
duty without any desire for the fruit of their actions (worship), |
are sattvika (good). The Lord in the Gita, has not prohibited the -
worship of manes (Gita 9/25). Those who worship the manes,
having a desire for fruits, such as their own safety and reward -
etc., go, to the manes. Such worshippers, regard their manes
as their favourite deities, who hold the highest positions. So,
they go to the abode of the manes, they cannot go to higher
regions, which are beyond the abode of the manes. But, those
who worship the manes as a part of their duty, without having :
any desire for fruits, are sattvika (good or pure), they are not
rajasa (passionate).

Those, who feed dogs and crows selflessly, obeying the
ordinance of scriptures, do not attain these. Similar, is the case
with those, who worship the manes, without any desire for fruits.
Their worship, leads them to salvation. Similarly obsequies, such
as Narayanabali and Gaya-Sraddha (offering of water, food etc.,
to the Brahmanas in honour of the manes), which are sanctioned |
by scriptures, are indispensable. These must be performed, so
that the soul of the dead persons, may attain higher states, such
as salvation etc. Such actions, are sattvika. |

Those, who while performing (yajiia) sacrifice, worship
Lord Ganega and Navagraha (nine planets) etc., according to
"
1830,"1776 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 17 -
ordinance of scriptures, without any desire for fruit, actually
worship the scripture, in the sameway, as a chaste wife of
even a demon, attains salvation, not because, she has served
her demon-husband but because, she has obeyed the Lord, the
saints and the scriptures. In the twenty-fifth verse of the ninth |
chapter, the worship of gods, has been mentioned to outline the
fate of worshippers, while in this vérse the worship of gods, has
been. mentioned to judge, the faith of a worshipper. So the term -
""Yajante’, has been used here. Thus the. Lord, explained that a
man worships, a deity according to his conviction, or faith. .
Appendix—The ‘“Sattvika’ persons who worship the gods, -
go to the gods after death, the Rajasa persons who worship :
. demigods (gnomes) and demons, go to them and the “Tamasa’ -
persons who worship ghosts and evil spirits, join the ghosts and
evil spirits (Gita 9/25). | ~
In the Gita, the term “Yajiia’ has a wide range, within which
religious sacrifice, charity, austerity, vow and performance of
duty etc.,—all are included (Gita 4/24-25). Therefore here also
within the term “Yajante’—performance of all duties and actions
should be included, out of which, Yajiia (religious sacrifice) is :
important. ‘Pretanbhutaganarhscanye’—Our manes are ghosts for
others and the manes of others are ghosts for us. Worship to
manes is not “[amasika’, but worship to ghosts is “Tamasika’.

Comment:— -
'ASastravihitarh ghoram tapyante ye tapo janah'—Those men _
perform dire austerities which are not sanctioned by the scriptures
rather forbidden. It is because of their tamasika intellect (intellect
enveloped in darkness) (Gita 18/32) that they themselves do
not know the ordinance of scriptures. Moreover, they are not
prepared to accept those ordinances, and act upon these, even
if, those ordinances, are explained to them by some person.
‘Dambhahankarasarmyuktah'—They, are full of hypocrisy and
egoism. They believe, that people who are engaged in adoration,
meditation and study of scriptures, are hypocrites. So they also |
pretend to be, what they are not, and are puffed up with pride,
because of their false intelligence, wisdom and knowledge etc.
They think that they can bring other people round, to their view-
point; and they need not listen to the scriptures, because they |
possess, enough knowledge.
'Kamaragabalanvitah'—The term 'Kama’, stands for lust, for
worldly pleasure. They remain engrossed in those pleasures 1.e.,
they remain attached to them. Impelled by the force of desire,
they have a thirst for these and so they want to secure and
maintain them. Thus,. they hanker after worldly'‘pleasure and

as the only. goal-of human life. They: have the feelings, that if
having. obtained this human life, they. have not enjoyed worldly
pleasure, they are just like beasts. If they have not acquired those :
materials, for enjoyment, what have they: gained? Without those |
enjoyments, their life has gone in vain. They are always given,

to sense-enjoyments. They perform austerities, obstinately with _
a view to acquire material for worldly enjoyment.: oo

- 'KarSayantah Sarirastharn bhitagramam'—They believe, that .
austerities consist in tormenting the group of five elements (earth, .
water, fire, air and ether), in their bodies.. According to them, -
austerity means bodily torture. -

- In the fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth verses of this
chapter, there is a description of the austerities of the body, speech ~
and mind. There is no mention of physical torture. Austerity
is performed very calmly, without tormenting the body. But the
austerities, referred to in this verse, are performed by tormenting
the body, against the ordinances of scriptures. So these are called
violent austerities. oS -

‘Mam caivantahSarirastham'—They, also torment the Lord,
‘Vho is lodged in their hearts. As God is seated in their hearts as
their very self, so when they torment the self, they torment God. |
Moreover, they torment Him, by disobeying His teachings.
'Tanviddhyasuraniscayan'—The Lord, declares that such
people should be known to be of demoniacal resolves. Here, the
expression ‘Asurani$cayan’, does not denote people of ordinary
demoniac nature; but those who are extremely demoniac, mean
and atheistic. | | 7
In the fourth verse, the term.'Yajante' (worship), has been
used, for those people who neglecting the ordinances of scriptures
due to their ignorance perform worship, with faith. But here
"
1833,"Verse 6] - SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 17799
the term, -‘tapyante’ (practise), has been used for people, who
intentionally neglect the ordinances of scriptures and are also
lacking in faith. The reason is, that people of demoniac resolve,
attach great importance to violent austerities, according to their .
- own fancy and whims. The mark, of their austerity is tormentation |
_ of body. They instead of believing in God, and the scriptures,
believe in austerities. They perform, violent austerities against
ordinances of the scriptures. They remain hungry, for a long
time, lie on thorns or nails bare bodied, stand on one leg only,
sit facing fire and perform other violent austerities, of such type, -
to torment their bodies. © =... | -

In the twenty-third verse of the sixteenth chapter, it is
mentioned that. those, who. having cast aside, ordinances of
scriptures, act under.the impulse of desire, attain neither perfection, _
nor happiness nor achieve the Supreme Goal. It means, that they
do not secure the full fruit of their actions, because they attach
importance to external activities, instead of internal feelings.

But, here people of demoniac resolves, go to the lower wombs

and hell, because they are given to hypocrisy and egoism, etc. .
Moreover, they neither have faith, nor want to listen to ordinances

of the scriptures and not act upon these.

In the twenty-third verse of the sixteenth chapter, there is .
reference to disobedience of the ordinance of scriptures through
indifference, in the first verse of this chapter, there is disobedience,
through lack of knowledge while, here it is, intentional and wilful
disobedience. Here the performance of austerities is made having

Comment:— | |
'Aharastvapi sarvasya trividho bhavati priyah'—In the fourth :
verse, the Lord, explained the means of ascertaining the conviction ~
of a person by his sattvika, rajasa and tamasa worship. But how
to know the conviction of a person who has no faith, and interest, -
in worship? The answer is, that every person, whether he is a -
believer or a non-believer, belonging to any sect or religion, has
to eat food. So.a man's conviction or faith can be known by the
food, which is. dear to him. By what dishes is a man naturally
tempted viz., on hearing, seeing and tasting the food articles,
by which the mind is attracted, that-will determine, his sattvika, -
rajasa or tamasa, faith,
Some may think that this is a description of three kinds of
food. If it is viewed from a gross point of view, the approach may
appear correct. But if we ponder over it deeply, it is not correct.
This is not description of three kinds of food. But actually it
indicates a person's taste for food in order to judge his faith.
The terms 'Sarvasya' (all) and 'Priyah' (dear), have been used
to indicate, that each person out of all human beings, wants to
eat a particular kind of food—sattvika, rajasa or tamasa, which is
dear to him. Thus, his nature is inferred from the nature of food
he likes and eats. Similarly 'Yajiiastapastatha danam' (sacrifice,
austerity and charity)* are also of three kinds. It makes out
*Here the term ‘Yajiia’ stands only for sacrifice, not for all duties or |
actions that are to be performed because besides the 'Yajfia’ (sacrifice), austerity

that a person studies books, keeps company, visits places and is
engaged in different sorts of activities, according to his sattvika,
rajasa or tamasa, temperament. |

'Tesarn bhedamimarh Srnu'—Lord Krsna asks Arjuna, to note _ -
the distinction of sacrifice, austerity and charity, according to a
man's temperament. A man, offers charity to a Brahmana (member
of the priest class), while another person offers charity, to a
common man. Some keep company with virtuous persons, whose |
food and conduct etc., are pure, while others keep company with -
evil persons.* , -

It means, that people of sattvika temperament like sattvika -
(good) food, company, environment and actions, etc., while
people of rajasika (passionate) temperament, have rajasika ;
tastes, and those of tamasika (ignorant) temperament, like food, -
company, environment and actions, which are not sanctioned
by scriptures. :

Appendix—T wo kinds of actions are performed by a man _
according to his temperament—secular and scriptural. Therefore
here within ‘food’, the secular actions (eating, drinking and the -
way of living etc.,) and within ‘austerity, sacrifice and charity’
the scriptural actions should be taken (understood).

and it is eaten, less than the appetite* by chanting the name of

__ [_An Important Fact Pertaining to the Topic |

In this context, it seems as if there is a description of three
types of food. But actually, it is a description of a person's

| inclination, which can be judged by the nature of food, which |
*The quantity of the food should be moderate, neither more nor less.
"
1839,"Verse 10} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1785 :
is dear to him. The following points, clarify it.
(1) In the seventh verse of this chapter, the Lord uses the
term 'Sarvasya', to indicate that all human beings, like three
kinds of food, according to their inclination. That inclination, -
decides a man's conviction. The term 'priyah' (dear), has also
been used in the eighth and tenth verses, and ‘Ista’ (dear) in the
ninth verse, which indicate a man's inclination, or taste. Had .
there been a context of food, the Lord, instead of using the term
‘priyah' (dear) or ‘Ista', would have said, that these are Sattvika .
foods, or the tamasika ones etc. ——
(2) The second argument, is that while mentioning the sattvika -
food, the Lord first explained the result of taking sattvika food, ;
and then sattvika food. It.is so, because a sattvika person, thinks
of the consequences of eating a particular food or performing -
an action, before he eats food, or performs an act.
_ A rajasika person, first eats food and then thinks, of its
adverse effect. So in rajasika food, first there is a description of
food and then its result, in the form, the pain, grief and sickness.
As far as the effect of the tamasika food, is concerned, the
Lord has not even mentioned it. It is so, because a tamasika
person, out of delusion does not think of the adverse effect,
of the food eaten. He does not think—whether it 1s earned by |
fair means or foul, whether it is pure or impure, whether it is
sanctioned by scriptures or not. He eats the food, like an animal.
It means that he, who eats sattvika food, possesses a divine nature, _
while he, who eats either rajasika or tamasika food, possesses,
a demoniac nature. | |
(3) Had the Lord described the food, He would have described
the food in more details, such as that livelihood, should be earned
by honest means; the food should he cooked by wearing clean
clothes in a well cleaned and pure kitchen; it should first be |
offered to God, and then eaten by thinking of Him, and chanting
His name. This sort of food, is sattvika. — ee
"
1840,"1786 — SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter17

Similarly, He would have described the rajasa food.
Livelihood should be earned by fair means or foul, having
predominance. of pride and. selfishness. The food should be
eaten for taste and fashion, and it should be eaten by. having ~
attachment, to it. This food. is rajasika. | :

In the same way, food is earned by foul. means, such as
falsehood, fraud, theft and robbery etc., without any sense of —
purity and cleanliness, in an impure atmosphere, the food items,
may be meat and egg etc., no attention is paid to how the food = _-
is cooked. One who takes food, does not wash his hands and feet —_—--
and takes it with his shoes on. No cleanliness is maintained and
it is eaten, in an impure atmosphere. Such food is tamasika. .

But here the Lord, has described the foods, which are dear
to the sattvika (good), the rajasika (passionate) and the tamasika
(ignorant), so that their inclinations, or faith could be known.

(4) Besides this, in the Gita where there is description of
food, there is reference only to the eaters, as ‘others restrict
their food’, (4/30), ""Yoga is not for him, who eats too much, but -
for him who is temperate, in food' (6/16-17), ‘Whatever thou
eatest' (9/27) and 'He who eats, but little’ (18/52).

Similarly, in the seventh verse of this chapter, the term 'tatha -
(also), denotes that a man performs sacrifice and austerity, and 7
offers charity according to his sattvika, rajasika or tamasika,
temperament. Similarly, in this chapter from the eleventh verse to
the twenty-second verse, also there is description of the nature of
those, who perform sacrifice and austerity, and offer charity. |

In the Upanisads, (Parts of different branches of Vedas) it is
mentioned 'As is the food, so is the mind’. As the food, a man
eats, so is his mind. So a man should eat pure food, because it |
purifies his mind. The place, seat, scene and atmosphere where |
he eats, the food should be pure and holy, as these also effect a
"
1841,"Verse 10} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1787 -
the mind: Moreover, feelings and thought of a cook should be
pure, and good. a Oo
Before, having a meal, a person should wash both the hands,
both the feet and the mouth. He should sit on a clean and pure
seat, with his face towards the east or the north. Then he should | .
offer food to the Lord, by. reciting verses—"" Whosoever offers to
Me with devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit or water, that offering :
of love, of the pure of heart I accept” (Gita 9/26). After this, ;
he should take a little water, on his palm and reciting a verse,
""The act of offering is God, the oblation is God. By God, it is
offered into the fire of God. God is verily to be attained by him .
who always sees God in action"" (Gita 4/24), one should drink -
it. Then, he should put the first morsel of food into his mouth |
by chanting the name of the Lord. While chewing a morsel, he - .
should recite the sacred mantra (hymn), of sixteen words ‘Hare _
Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare Hare, Hare Krsna Hare
Krsna Krsna Krsna Hare Hare’ (or chant the name of his favourite
deity), two times. Thus he chews a morsel thirty-two times,
because there are sixteen words in the sacred hymn (formula).
Thus, the food becomes digestible and nourishing and one remains -
absorbed, in the adoration of the Lord by chanting His names,
which purify, the food. |

If a person, while having a meal has evil propensities, such
as hatred, envy, jealousy, fear and greed, his food is not digested -
well, and he suffers from indigestion. So, while eating food,
he should be free from all these evil propensities, and should
remain calm and pleased. It is heard, that a dog is allowed to
run after a calf before a cow is milked. The cow grows angry,
after seeing the dog. That milk is offered to soldiers, so that
they may become cruel. |

An experiment was made on some horses. Some of them
were fed with milk of cows, while others were fed with the milk
of buffaloes. The former could cross a stream, while the latter
"
1842,"1788 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter17  _
could not. Similarly, if there is a fight between a bullock and |
a buffalo, the buffalo defeats the bullock. But if both of them
draw a cart in the heat of the sun, the bullock is more active. The
reason is that milk of the cow contains sattvika nourishment.

As good and evil feelings, have their effect on food, sohave ~
looks. If an evil person or a hungry dog, has a look at food, it
becomes impure. So what to do? He who wants to eat that food,
should think that Lord Himself in that form has come to eat the
food. So, first he should offer a part of it to Him, and then eat
the remaining food himself. By doing so, the food is purified. 7

Secondly, those who take a share of the calf from the milk :
of a cow, make the milk impure. If they milk the cow, after the -
calf has been well-fed, the milk is pure.

The feelings of a person, who eats, and of the person, who
offers food, have also their effect, on food. (1) Food which is -
offered with great pleasure, is of superior quality. (11) The food
offered with pleasure, but the eater thinks that he has saved
some money, by receiving free food——-it is considered of medium
quality. (iit) Food offered with a feeling of compulsion, that he
has been forced to offer the food, because someone has arrived, ""
and the eater eats the food having the feeling of selfishness—that
food is, of an inferior quality.

In the Gita it is mentioned, that good persons are devoted
to the welfare of all beings (5/25, 12/4). It means that the things |
and actions of persons, who are devoted to the welfare of other
beings, are pure and holy.

The following verses, should be recited when a meal is over—

“All beings come forth from food, food is produced. from
rain, rain ensues from sacrifice and sacrifice, is born of action.
Action has its origin in Brahma (Vedas), and the Vedas spring
from the Imperishable (God); therefore the all-pervading (Brahma),
ever rests in sacrifice"" (Gita 3/14-15).

Then, in order to digest food he should recite ""Becoming the
"
1843,"Verse 11] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1789 -
fire which dwells in the bodies of living beings, and mingling |
with the upward and downward breaths, I digest the four kinds
of food"" (Gita 15/14), and: move the navel, with the middle
finger slowly.

Link:—Having explained, that the faith of a person can be
known by his worship or by the food, which is dear to him, the
Lord now explains, the three kinds of sacrifice, by which a man's -
faith or inclination, is known.

Sacrifice (yajna) which is performed, according to scriptural
law, by those, who expect no reward and believe firmly, that it is
their duty to offer the sacrifice, is sattvika (good). 11
Comment:—
'Yastavyameveti'—Being blessed with human body a man, -
becomes eligible to perform the sacrifice according to his caste
and social order, with a firm belief, that it is his duty to do so,
and he should not expect any reward, either here or hereafter. |
The terms ‘eva’ (only), and ‘Tti' (thus), have been used, to
emphasize the fact, that it is his duty and it must be done. He
should, have no other consideration, except performance of
duty, for duty's sake.
‘Aphalakanksibhih'— A man, expects no reward, either here
or hereafter, for sacrifice, which he offers.
'Yajiio vidhidrsto ya ijyate'—The sacrifice, should be offered,
according to the ordinance of scriptures.
If he expects no reward, then why should he perform a
sacrifice? The Lord, answers 'Manah samadhaya (mind having
"
1844,"1790 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter17
reconciled), 1.e., it-is his duty, to perform it. . a

The term 'yastavyam’*, denotes that sacrifices should be
offered, as a duty. When a man offers sacrifice having desire of
gaining honour, praise and riches here, and heaven and luxuries,
in the next birth, he is attached to the sacrifice. But if he performs
it, without any kind of reward, his affinity with it is renounced
and (in absence of selfishness and pride), his ego is purified.

In it there is a vital point, that when a doer performs an ~
action, he gets affinity with it. An action, is in the image ofa =~
doer viz., as is the doer, so is his action. The Lord, in the third
verse of this chapter, declares, ""As is a man's faith, sois he"" and ~~
he acts according to his faith. It means, that as affinity of adoer
with an action remains, there is every possibility of his getting
into bondage. But if he performs an act, as a matter of duty
without having any attachment for it, his affinity is renounced
and he gets liberated. How is an action to be performed, only for _
duty's sake? A person, has to do nothing for himself. He should —__
have no affinity, with any object, time and place etc. He should
perform his duty, according to the need of the hour. Thus, he
will not desire to reap the fruit of action, and will not be bound.

On the other hand, attachment leads him, to bondage. It is
declared in the Gita—""The Yogis (men of action) perform actions,
only with their senses, mind, intellect and body, abandoning
attachment"" (5/11). It means, that a Karmayogi, should not have
any affinity with body, senses and mind. It also implies, that
he should not have any. affinity, with the ladle, the place and
materials for oblation. | _ ,

Sacrifice, and its fruit, both have a beginning and an end,
they appear and disappear, while the soul is imperishable and

_ * Duty is the action which should be performed, which ts according to |
One's capacity and by which the aim is achieved. ae -

eternal. But, he (the soul) assumes his affinity with actions, and

their fruits. Until he renounces this affinity, he gets entangled, .

in the cycle of birth and death (Gita 5/12).
Sattvaguna, enables a man to renounce his affinity with the -

world, and leads him to God-realization, therefore, it is called

as 'Sat' or transcendental.* All the qualities of the divine nature

are Sattvika. But a person possessing divine nature realizes God,

only when he transcends the three gunas (modes of nature). _

| * In the Srimadbhagavata in the twenty-fifth chapter of the eleventh

section besides the three Gunas there is also the description of the state which

transcends the three Gunas while in the Gita there is the description of the

three Gunas only. Why is it so when Lord Krsna is the speaker in both of -

them? The answer is that when the sacrifice is performed as a duty (17/11),

gifts are made as a duty (17/20) and an action is performed as a duty (18/9),

the person has no affinity with actions and their fruits, and so the Sattvika

actions turn into transcendental ones.
At the end of the seventeenth chapter also the Lord while describing

the Lord's name ‘Sat’ out of the three names ‘Orn’, ‘Tat’, ‘Sat’, declares that

all the actions which are performed for the sake of the Lord become ‘Sat’

viz., real (transcendental) (17/27). It means that the actions of a Karmayogt

become transcendental when he renounces attachment to the actions and their

fruits, while the actions of a Bhaktiyogi become transcendental when they

are performed for the sake of the Lord. So there is no description of the state

which transcends the three Gunas. .
In the Gita it is also mentioned the Sattvaguna (The mode of goodness)

binds (14/6) and those established in Sattvaguna rise to the higher regions

(14/18). Why? The answer is that it is not Sattvaguna which binds but it is

attachment to it which binds (14/6, 13/21). Similarly the assumption that one |

is established in Sattvaguna also leads him to bondage (14/18).

sake of ostentation, know, O best of the Bharatas (Arjuna), that
such sacrifice is rajasika (passionate). 12 SO |
Comment:— | 3 a
‘Abhisandhaya tu phalam'—Sacrifice, which is performed |
to acquire the desirable and to avert the undesirable, is 'rajasa
sacrifice’. If anyone performs a sacrifice, in order to obtain
riches, name and fame, honour, obedient servants, sons, family —-
and heaven etc., this is desire, to acquire the desirable. Our
enemies should be destroyed; we should never be dishonoured, —
disrespected and slighted; we should never face unfavourable
circumstances—this is desire, to avert the undesirable. _ -
‘Dambharthamapi caiva yat'—Sacrifice which is offered by _-
a man, showing himself off, as a virtuous, good, charitable,
righteous and great person for ostentation and for self glorification, -
is rajasika. It includes sacrifice, offered by people of demoniacal
nature, as described in 16/15 and 16/17.
""Ijyate bharataSrestha tarh yajiiarn viddhi rajasam'— Sacrifice
offered, in expectation of reward or for ostentation, is rajasika. ;
: Such sacrifice is offered, strictly according to the ordinance
of scriptures. The reason, is that if it is not performed according
to the ordinance of scriptures, it will not bear full fruit. Similarly,
if either the method or the action, happens to be contrary, to the
sanctioned one, it will bear a contrary fruit i.e., it may be harmful
for the performer. But the person who offers a sacrifice only for
ostentation does not care much, about the ordinance of scriptures.
By using the term ‘""Viddh1', Lord Krsna, wants to emphasize
the fact that mundane attachment (desire), is the root cause of
the cycle of birth and death. So, Arjuna should beware of it. ©
Appendix—The term ‘yat’ used in this verse expresses the idea
that whatever sacrifice or charity or austerity is done in expectation
of reward or for the sake of ostentation is ‘Rajasa’. :

Sacrifice, which is not in conformity with, the ordinances of
scriptures, in which no food is offered, no 'mantras' are chanted,
no donation is made and which is without faith—that sacrifice, is ;
of the nature of ignorance viz., tamasika. 13
Comment:— | _
‘Vidhihinam'—There are different methods, for different kinds :
of sacrifice, in which there is guidance for the altar, utensils for -
oblation, direction and seating etc. Similarly, different materials -
are used, in the sacrifice for different gods and goddesses etc.,
as in the sacrifice for the Goddess Durga, the cloth and material -
of red colour are used. In tamasa sacrifice, the ordinances are
not followed, but are renounced, due to indifference.
'Asrstannam'—Tamasika people, who offer wealth as sacrifice,
do not offer food, as charity to Brahmanas, because they think
that Brahmanas will become idle, if they get free food and they -
could not work. |
‘Mantrahinam'—In tamasika sacrifice, sacred hymns are not
chanted, as tamasika people think, that a sacrifice is performed by
offering oblation, because it kills germs, and fragrance, spreads.
But there ts no need for the chanting of sacred hymns.
‘Adaksinam'—No sacrificial donations are paid to a priest |
or Brahmanas, 1n tamasika sacrifice, because people of tamasika
temperament, think that they have offered food to them already.
If they offer fees to them, they will become idle and lazy, and
will create a problem of unemployment, and so on. According
to them, such Brahmanas are a burden on the earth. But they do
not think that if they do not offer fees or food to the Brahmanas,
the Brahmanas may or may not become idle and lazy, but they
"
1848,"1794 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA fChapter17
themselves will become heedless, by renouncing their duty.
'Sraddhavirahitarh. yajitarh tamasam paricaksate'—As_ far
_ as, offering an oblation into the fire, (yajiia) is concerned, the
tamasika people think that it is very foolish*, that food articles;
such as grain, churned butter, barley, rice, coconut, date, palm
etc., which are useful to maintain the body, should be burnt
| in a fire. If they perform sacrifice, that is only to gain name,
fame, honour and praise, without obeying scriptural ordinances,
without distributing food, without chanting hymns, and without
paying any donations. a BS
They have no faith, either in scripture, or sacred hymns, = -
or sacrifice or-its fruit; out of delusion. They act, contrary to
ordinance of scriptures. They are just like, the people of the Kali ~
age, who do not believe in caste and social order, and who are __
engrossed in activities, contrary to ordinances of the scriptures.
In tamasa sacrifice, a man having cast aside the ordinance
of scriptures, acts according to his own sweet will (Gita 16/23)
and it is offered without faith (Gita 17/28). These two feelings
are involved in it. So, he attains, neither the occult power, nor — -
the highest goal, nor even happiness, here or hereafter. He rather
descends into the womb of an insect, a bird or a beast or into
infernal regions (14/18). Absence of faith, is the cause of their
damnation. As they perform forbidden actions, without faith,
they must get punishment for it.
* When a farmer mixes the seed in the earth, its production is thousands
of times more than the seed sown when the crop is ripe. Similarly the oblation
offered by chanting scriptural hymns will certainly bear fruit. So far as the seed
mixed in the earth is concerned, it is material as the earth is insentient while
the oblation offered into the fire is divine because gods are sentient; and that
oblation results in rain which is very useful. Manuji has declared:
~ ""The oblation offered into fire strengthens the rays of the sun and those
strengthened rays result in rain (Even the modern scientists accept this fact).""
All beings come forth from food, from rain food is produced (Gita 3/14) |
and rain ensues from sacrifice (Gita 3/14).
"
1849,"Verse 14] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1795 /
In a sacrifice, if the doer, his knowledge, actions, fortitude, :
intellect, company, the scripture and eatables, are sattvika, it is
sattvika sacrifice, if they are rajasika, it is rajasika sacrifice, and
if they are tamasika, it is tamasika sacrifice.

Worship of the gods, of the Brahmanas, teachers, elders and
the wise (liberated soul) with purity, uprightness, celibacy and non-
violence—this is said to be, the penance (tapa) of the body. 14
Comment:— , .
'Devadvijaguruprajnapijanam'—Here the term ‘Deva’,
particularly stands for Lord Visnu, Lord Siva, GaneSa, Goddess
Durga and the Sun-god, the five chief deities of the category of
the Lord. So a devotee, should worship his favourite deity, out
of the five, without having any desire for fruit.* |
Twelve Aditya, eight Vasus, eleven Rudras and two
ASvinikumaras—these thirty-three gods, are also included in
the term 'Deva'. The gods, who are worshipped in sacrifices,
pilgrimages, fasts (vows) on special festivals and occasions, such
as sacred-thread ceremony and marriages etc., are also included,
in the term ‘Deva’. Their worship is sanctioned by scriptures.
- as the Supreme while the others are regarded as gods by them.
"
1850,"1796 §RIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter17
So, they should be worshipped, in accordance with ordinance
of the scriptures. |

Though the term 'Dvija' (twice-born), denotes Brahmanas,
Ksatriyas and Vaisyas, but here in the context of worship, it
stands only for, the Brahmanas.

_ Here the term 'Guru' (teachers) stand for parents, elders,
preceptors and those, who are senior in age, and superior, learning _
and social order etc. Obedience and service to them, offering
flowers, incense, light and food, to them and steps to please
them—all these are included in their worship. .

Here the term 'Prajiia' (the wise), stands for liberated souls. ~
Their worship, consists in carrying out their orders, following
their principles and treating them, with reverence from the heart. _
In fact, Brahmanas and preceptors are venerable, from aworldly -
point of view. But a liberated soul, is adorable and venerable,
from a spiritual point of view. We should respect them from the
core of our heart, rather than externally. Respect which comes
from one's heart, is real respect.

Saucam'—Here the term 'Saucam' (purity) stands for external ~
purity i.e., purity of the body, with water and earth. External
purity, causes internal purity. Through purity, a man realizes
that filth in the form of excrement, urine, perspiration, phlegm
and spit etc., continuously comes out of the body, though it is
purified again and again. Moreover, this body consists of impure
bones, flesh and marrow etc. This body is nothing but a factory
to produce filth and urine. Being conscious of the impurity
and filthness of the body, a man rises above the body. Having
done so, he has no sense of superiority in him, in respect of
social order, stage of life, status and position etc. In order to,
inculcate these feelings, purity is observed.

These days, some people complain that those who maintain
purity, hate others. It is wrong. Maintenance of purity, does not
mean hate for others. It merely means, that this body can never
"
1851,"Verse 14] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1797 |
remain pure, though it may be made pure again and again, with - |
water and earth etc. |
Learned people regard the body as impure, because it is born |
of the parent's semen and menstrual discharge, it is nourished |
by the food eaten, it is full of excrement, urine, spit, saliva and |
sweat etc., it is mortal, and it is made clean, with water and earth. |
'‘Arjavam'—It consists, in the absence of crookedness i.e., there |
should not be any stiffness and twist, in a body. Man who has |
pride, becomes crooked. So a striver, who wants to attain salvation |
should renounce pride, by doing so, he develops uprightness. /
""Brahmacaryam'—It consists in abstaining from sex. One who
observes celibacy, should take the following precautions. - |
; (ij) He should not remember past sexual intercourse. - |
(Gi) He should not talk to women, with attachment. (iii) He
should not joke, with them. (iv) He should not gaze at them. - |
(v) He should not talk to them, in loneliness. (vi) He should not _ |
think of sexual intercourse. (vii) He should be determined not |
; to indulge in sexual intercourse. (viii) He should not indulge in |
sexual intercourse. |
A person, in the state of celibacy and in retired order |
(Vanaprastha), and renounced order (Sannydsa), must preserve ~ |
his seminal fluid, in action and thought. A householder, can have |
sexual intercourse with his wife, after the period of the mense |
every month, according to ordinance of the scriptures. Such a |
person, who observes this rule, 1s considered a celibate, even |
during his family life. A widow, who controls her sex desire, |
attains the same goal as a celibate does. |
In fact, a celibate is he, who is firm in the vow of celibacy |
(Gita 6/14). But if there is seminal emission during sleep or |
because of a disease etc., when a person does not want discharge |
of semen, it means that he is, firm in celibacy. So a celibate, |
should have pure feelings and never allow his mind to be diverted, |
: towards a woman. Even if, by chance it is diverted he should |
|
|
|
|
|
|
"
1852,"1798 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 17 |
have a firm determination, to observe celibacy. _ | |

‘Ahirnsa'—Total lack of violence is Ahishsa. A man, commits
violence out of selfishness, anger, greed and delusion. Usurpation |
of others property, is violence out of selfishness, hurting or
murdering others is violence out of anger, killing an animal; for - |
meat and leather, or murdering a person in order to get money, |
is violence out of greed, and striking a dog or plucking a branch
of a tree or kicking anyone, is violence out of delusion. |

'‘Sdrirath tapa ucyate'—Worship of the gods etc., purity, = |
uprightness, celibacy and non-violence—this is penance (tapa) /
of the body. Pilgrimage, vows and self-control, should also be |
included in the penance of body. Penance, in which a body is .
tortured, is not a noble type of penance, because such a person, |
who performs violent penance, is known to be, demoniac in his 7 |
resolve (17/6). Noble penance, consists in following the path of
self-discipline, according to ordinance of scriptures and family |
traditions etc., and also in tolerating the unfavourable circumstances
happily. It involves, control over the body, senses and mind. |

In Yoga, where there is description of its eight parts, there is |
description of Yama’, first of all. Yama (self-restraint), consists
of harmlessness, veracity (truthfulness), continence, non-stealing |
and non-acquisition of property (YogadarSana 2/30). These are
also five Niyamas (religious vows). They are purity, contentment, |
askesis, study of Vedas and self-surrender to God (Yogadarsana |
2/32). Out of these two, more importance is attached to Yama,
because in it there is control over body, mind and senses etc., |
while in Niyama, a man has to follow religious vows.*

A layman may regard, bodily torture as bodily penance. |
But actually having been detached, from the mundane, one who |
practises self-restraint or renunciation, is superior to him, who

*The demons such as HiranyakaSipu, Hiranyaksa and Ravana etc., |
possessed Niyamas i.e., they practised religious vows but they had no Yamas |
viz., self-restraint. ce enmeeenene weer |
"
1853,"Verse 15] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1799
tortures his body, because, peace immediately follows renunciation |
(Gita 12/12). External penance, does not lead to God-realization,
but it can be conducive to God-realization, through internal purity.
So a striver, besides practising Yamas (self-restraint), should also
practise Niyamas (religious vow), as and when, required. |
Appendix—In the penance of the body, renunciation is
important; as in worship there is renunciation of one’s superiority
complex, in maintenance of purity there is renunciation of indolence
and heedlessness, in uprightness there is renunciation of pride,
in celibacy there is renunciation of sex, in non-violence there is
renunciation of one’s own comforts. Thus renunciation involves .
the penance of the body. .

*A man should utter true and pleasant words. He should neither utter

Loving, sweet, artless and gentle words, which are free from

| The words, which are altogether free from violence, envy,
jealousy and enmity etc., which are full of love, compassion,
forgiveness, generosity and good wishes and which do harm to
none, at present or in the future, are 'Hita’, viz., beneficial.
'Svadhyayabhyasanam caiva'—A study of the sacred books,
such as the Gita, Ramayana and Bhagavata etc., and explaining /
these to others, and describing the glories of the characters of the
Lord, and His devotees, and narrating these to others, is '‘Svadhyaya'. ~
Recitation of sacred books, such as the Gita etc., again and -

persons, things and circumstances etc., is not permanent, but |
short-lived. Cheerfulness, which is revealed by giving up evils, |
remains permanent, and the mind, then becomes serene. |
A man's peace of mind is disturbed, when he depends on |
the perishable worldly persons, such as his wife, sons and other
members of the family, as well as, property and riches etc. If, instead | |
of depending on the perishable, he depends only on the Lord, Who |
is eternal and imperishable, he can never lose, peace of mind. |
The methods to remain cheerful— |
(3) One should be free, from attachment and aversion, to |
persons and circumstances etc. -
(11) One should not be partial, out of selfishness and pride. |
(311) One should be full of divine traits, such as compassion, |
forgiveness and generosity etc. . |
(iv) One should have feelings for the welfare, of all beings. . |
(v) One, whose diet is balanced and regular, whose nature |
favours living in loneliness, who is reserved, who is temperate in |
sleep and recreation, according to ordinance of scriptures, such
a striver, gains cheerfulness of mind, very quickly. |
‘Saumyatvam'—A person, who remains free from feelings of - |
violence, cruelty, ruthlessness, ferocity, jealousy etc., and who |
has faith in the Lord's virtues, such as compassion etc., and His |
omnipresence, possesses gentleness or placidity. His placidity, is
not disturbed, even if anyone uses harsh words for him, insults |
him, accuses him or there is loss in business etc. |
'Maunam'—Here, the term ‘Maunam’, stands for mental |
penance. Real silence, consists in remaining equanimous in |
the pairs of opposites, such as favourable and unfavourable |
circumstances, union and disunion, attachment and aversion,
pleasure and pain etc.* |
* Here the term 'Maunam’ does not stand for absence of speech. Had it |
- been so, it would have been included in the penance of speech. |

|
"
1856,"1802 _ §RIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter17
Constant application of the mind, to the words of ‘saints,

to the thought of virtues, glories and character, of the Lord as
described in the sacred texts, such as the Gita, Ramayana and
Bhagavata as also to the thought of the welfare and salvation of
living beings, is also included in the term ‘Maunam’.

'Atmavinigrahah'—When mind becomes thoroughly disciplined
and steady, it is called 'Atmavinigrahah’. Moreover, real self-
control, consists in concentrating the mind and diverting it, as
and when a person so desires. It means, that he should not be
controlled by the mind, rather he should control it. | :

'BhavasamSuddhih'—A pure state of mind, free from
selfishness and pride, having the thought of welfare of others,
is purity of nature. A man's nature, becomes pure when he thinks :
of the Lord and depends only on Him, and nature becomes -
impure, when he depends on the perishable world.

'‘Ityetattapo manasamucyate’—Thus penance, which has
predominance of mind, is called the penance of mind.

Appendix—A man should remain cheerful even in unfavourable
circumstances. He should remain unaffected by circumstances. He -
should remain placid (gentle), even after hearing the undesirable
utterances of others. He should not let the mind be free but make
it contemplative because by leaving it free, there is enjoyment
of pleasure and it does not become contemplative. He should
renounce the ‘miidha’ (deluded), ‘ksipta’ (volatile) and ‘viksipta’
(sometimes constant, sometimes volatile) inclinations of the mind.

He should never think ill of anyone. All this is penance of the mind.

Link:—Now the Lord, in the next three verses, describes

In the Gita it is seen that Arjuna puts questions attaching importance to
actions while Lord Krsna answers attaching importance to feelings. In the fifty-
fourth verse of the second chapter Arjuna asked “How does the man of stable
mind speak?"" The Lord replied that he who is neither happy in favourable
circumstances nor unhappy in unfavourable ones, is a sage of stable mind.

while the rajasika and the tamasika, should be discarded. The |
reason, is that the former one, is conducive to liberation, while
the latter ones, lead to bondage. Therefore, the Lord, has used
the term ‘trividham' (threefold), in order to explain, that the |
sattvika penance, includes the threefold-penance, of the body,
mind and speech.
'Sattvikam paricaksate'—Penance performed with supreme |
faith, without expectation of reward, is called sattvika.

'‘Satkaramanapijartham tapah kriyate'—People of rajasa
temperament, perform sacrifice, in order to win respect, honour
and reverence, in society. They expect others to respect them, as
men of penance, possessing self-control, truth and non-violence. —_______
They perform it, so that people may bow to them, wash their
feet, offer flowers and garlands to them, wave lights before them,
and touch their forehead with the dust of their feet. During their 1
life, and after death, they may have a funeral procession with
grandeur, make monument, and offer flowers, sandalwood paste, |
water and clothes etc., to monuments.
‘Dambhena caiva yat'—Though they have no faith in penances,
yet they perform these, for the sake of show. They sit cross-
legged, start counting the beads of a rosary and worshipping
God, by way of ostentation. |

""Tadiha proktam rajasam calamadhruvam'—The fruit of rajasa |
penance, is said to be uncertain and perishable. It means, that a
penance which is performed in order to win respect, honour and __
reverence bears perishable fruit, while penance which is performed _-
for ostentation, may bear fruit or not, and the ostentation may
be, a success or not. ,
‘The expression ‘Iha proktam,' means that a person gets |
the reward of the rajasika penance, here in the world. Sattvika
people, go to higher regions—heaven etc., the tamasika, descend -
to lower regions—hell etc., while the rajasika, remain in the ©
middle regions (Gita 14/18). Therefore, rajasika penance, bears = -
fruit here, in the form of respect, honour and praise: |
Can a rajasika person perform penance of the body, mind
and speech? He can worship the gods, by expecting a reward. ~
He can be gentle and can study scriptures. But he cannot observe ,
celibacy and non-violence. He cannot be placid and cheerful,
because projection and distraction of the mind, disturb him, -
because of his desire. Moreover, how can his nature be pure,
when he performs penance, in order to win respect, honour and ~
reverence? So a rajasika person, cannot perform, the threefold
penance fully. .

A gift, charity which is made, to one from whom no return is
expected, with the feeling, that it is one's duty to give, and which
is given at a proper place and time and to a worthy person, that =
gift is held to be Sattvika (good). 20
Comment:— : | | | |
Here in this verse, there are two kinds of gifts: (4) A gift is
_ made to one, from whom no return is expected, and regarding
it as a duty. (ii) It is made at a proper place and time and to a
worthy person. — | .
""Datavyamiti yaddanam diyate'nupakarine deSe kale ca patre
ca'—A person, should offer a gift while regarding it, as his .
duty. He has to give things in charity to others, because he has
wrongly claimed these, as his own. One, who has got possession
| over some things, has responsibility to give these to others. So, ~
he should make a gift without expecting any return, at all, here
| or hereafter.
Whom should it be given? The answer is, that it should be
given to those, who have neither done good to him, nor there
is any possibility of getting return in future. It does not mean, .
that he should not give to those, who have done him good. But
it means, that by doing so he should not regard it, as a gift. He
cannot repay the debt of persons, who have done good to him, by |
merely making a gift. So he must help them, without regarding TO
it as a gift (charity). A gift, which is made with expectation of
some return, is called rajasika.
The expression 'Dese kale ca patre ca’, has a double meaning
and both of these should be taken here in this context. :
(i) A gift should be made, at a place, where it is needed
1.e., 1t should be made, in the place which 1s affected (e.g.,) by
drought, flood and famine etc. It should be made at a time, when
it is needed. It should be made to a needy person. |
(i1) It should be made at a place of pilgrimage, such as the
Ganges, the Yamuna, the Godavari rivers or Kuruksetra, Prayaga |
"
1861,"Verse 20} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1809 ;
and Kasi etc., and on sacred occasions, such as the full moon and
the last day of the dark fortnight Sankranti, (the passage of the
sun from one zodiacal sign to another) etc., to a learned person,
who is well-versed in the scripture, or to. a pious and virtuous, -
hermit or beggar, or to any other deserving candidate. /

'Taddanam sattvikarh smrtam'—Such a gift, is held to be
sattvika. Actually, all things in the universe, are not anyone's
personal property, they belong to all the beings. So, a thing
should be given to a person who needs it, because he has a claim
on it. It should be given to him, because it actually belongs to
him. It means that we have assumed, the things which are not .
ours, as ours. So, we should give these to him, who needs them, _ “
with the conviction that actually such things do not belong to |
us, but they belong to him, who needs them. -

Thus a gift, by making which, any connection with the thing -
gifted, and with its reward, and with the act of making the gift,
is totally renounced, is called 'sattvika’. _ |

Appendix—This ‘Sattvika charity’ is in fact renunciation.

This is not the charity about which it has been said “If you offer -

charity, it bears its fruit a thousand times”, because in it there

is affinity with ‘the reward of a thousand*. But in renunciation

affinity is cut asunder. The charity which is made with the hope

of a return becomes ‘rajasa’—‘yattu pratyupakarartham’ (Gita
17/21). In order to negate this ‘rajasa’ notion, here the term
‘anupakarine’ has been used.

The mode of goodness in the Gita has been described
‘anamaya’ (flawless) (Gita 14/6) because it is conducive to
renunciation. In ‘Sattvaguna’ (the mode of goodness) affinity is |
renounced; in ‘Rajoguna’ affinity is established; in “Tamoguna’
delusion is caused.

A gift, which is made with the hope of a return or in |
_ expectation of a reward, or in a grudging spirit is said to be,
rajasika (passionate). 21 -
Comment:—
'Yattu pratyupakarartham'—A rajasika gift, is made with Te
the hope of return. Rajasika people, think that if they make
a gift to the family priest, of their relatives, the relatives will -
also give gifts to the former's family priest. Thus, their family .
priest will get money. Similarly they want to offer a gift to the
priest, who is an astrologer, so that he may tell them the lucky
moment of the marriage of their sons and daughters, and also a
of their journey, and business etc. Moreover, they want to make
the gift to a priest, who is a physician, so that he may give them
valuable medicines. Thus the gift, which is made to expect a
return, is called 'Pratyupakarartha’. | o
‘Phalamuddisya va punah'—This gift, is made with a view,
that it will bring some unseen reward or heavenly pleasure.
Rajasika people, make a gift at places of pilgrimage, (the
Ganges, the Yamuna, Kuruksetra etc., and on sacred occasions,
such as the last day of a dark fortnight. (Amavasya), the full
moon (Purnima) and eclipses etc., and to deserving learned ,

priests, who have studied the Vedas. But, because of the desire
for reward, it has been called rajasika. So Lord Krsna, has not
mentioned, that it should be made, at a proper place and time _
and to a worthy person. _ | | |
- Here, the term ‘punah' (then or again), has been used to
denote, that such a person first thinks of the man, to whom he |
is indebted or from whom he expects a reward, and then he :
makes a gift. | :
'Diyate ca pariklistam'—A rajasika gift, is made in a grudging
and helpless mood, under compulsion or force. Whatever they ;
give, is given, in a miserly manner, by being grieved, at heart. -
They believe, that by giving more, the habits of a donee will get
spoiled, while they could suffer loss. So, it will be difficult for
them, to run their lives smoothly. Thus they make petty gifts, _
in a higgling way. :

Comment:— |
'Asatkrtamavajiidtam'—A tamasika gift, is made without
respect, in a disdainful spirit. When a priest, comes to receive
the gift, to the house of tamasika people, they treat him with
contempt and say that he did not come to their house, when his
presence was required. Another member of the family says, that |
"
1864,"1812 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 17 .

they should not be ensnared by such priests, they should instead

give to the poor and the needy. They regard them as a dog, who

should be given a morsel of food, otherwise it will bark. Sucha

gift 1s called tamasa, because by it ordinance of scriptures and |

the Brahmanas (members of the priest class), are dishonoured.
'Adesakale yaddanam'—Out of delusion, the tamasika people,

do not attach any importance to proper place and time. They say,

that they have to make a gift, so it could be made, at any place

and time. Thus they offer the gift, by dishonouring the ordinance

of scriptures, because they instead of attaching importance to the ”

ordinance of scriptures attach importance to the money.’ :
""Apatrebhyasca diyate'—The tamasika people, give charity

(gift), to an unworthy person, arguing that food given as a gift,

will satisfy the hunger of that person also, and so it is, also a -

virtuous action. Moreover, they assume that the people of the

priestly class, have made such rules, to earn their livelihood.
""Tattamasamudahrtam'—Such a gift is declared to be tamasika. Se
Question:—In the Gita it is mentioned, that the tamasika people,

go downwards (1.e., into the wombs, of insects, birds and beasts -

or into infernal regions) (14/18), while in the Ramacaritamanasa |

it is mentioned, that charity (gift) given in anyway leads to

the good. Thus, the two statements seem to be contradictory. .
Answer:—Tamasika people go downwards, but this rule is a

not applicable for gifts, because when a person makes a gift,

he has to renounce his affinity for the gift. It is because of this

renunciation, that even tamasika charity, is not conducive to

hurl one to downward regions. So, a gift has been eulogized, |

in Srimadbhagavata (12/3/18), in Manusmrti (1/86) and also in

Ramacaritamanasa (7/103 b). The reason, is that a person who

has even little renunciation, cannot have a downfall.
Secondly, in this Kali age, when the hearts of people have

become very impure, a concession has been granted by the Lord, .

that charity (gift) given in any form, leads a man to the good. |
"
1865,"Verse 22] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1813
By making gifts, a man develops this trait, in his nature and
that trait, will lead him to the good. So a gift should be made
even without respect. So a saint has interpreted the expression
' ‘'Sraddhaya deyamasgraddhayadeyam,'’ that a gift should be -

offered with reverence, but it should be offered even, if there :
is nO reverence.

A gift of food, water, clothes and medicines should be
made to a needy recipient, without much thinking, whether he | .
is worthy or unworthy, and whether the place and time, are -
auspicious or not. Offer food, to a hungry man, water, to a -
thirsty person, clothes to the naked and medicines to the sick. .
Similarly, the act of freemg a man from fear and torture etc., is
a gift of fearlessness, which should be made. These gifts, are to -
be made, according to the need of the moment.

One point is to be kept in mind, that an unworthy person, — ,
should be given only so much of food and water, that he may
not die of starvation or thirst. If he is given more, he may again
indulge in sins, such as violence etc.

A devotee, beholds His Lord in all beings. So he worships
his Lord, by performing his duty, instead of giving charity (gift), .
to a person (Gita 18/46). It means, that a devotee's activities, a
are connected with God.

In this chapter from the eleventh to the twenty-second
verses, the sattvika sacrifice, penance and gift, are included in |
divine nature,while the rajasika and tamasika, are included in
demoniac nature.

The fruit of rajasika sacrifice, penance and gift, can be
divided into two parts—seen and unseen. The seen fruit, can
further be divided into two parts—immediate and future. The |
"
1866,"1814 a SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 17
immediate fruit of rajasika food, is that it satisfies hunger, while _-
its remote fruit, is that 1t causes diseases. Similarly, the unseen
fruit can also be divided into two parts—here and hereafter. As. -
sacrifice, which is performed for the sake of ostentation (17/12),
the penance which is performed, in order to win respect, honour
and reverence (17/18) and a gift which is made with the hope of .
a return (17/21), bear fruit here.* But, if these are performed, in
order to attain heaven, they bear fruit, hereafter. Rajasika sacrifice,
which is performed for its fruit (17/12), and the gift made for a
reward (17/21) can bear fruit, here as well as, hereafter. Out of .
those, who perform sacrifice, in order to attain heaven (2/42-43; -
9/20-21) and those ‘who perform sacrifice, penance and make
a gift, for ostentation, respect, honour, reverence and reward,
follow the cycle of birth and death.t But the tamasika people _
who perform tamasika sacrifice and penance (17/13, 19) have a
fall (14/18), into the foulest hell (16/16), into demoniacal wombs
(16/19) and go down, to the lowest state (16/20). -
Those, who go to heaven, as the fruit of their sacrifice, suffer
from envy, jealousy and vanity theret. Satakratu, the king of -
'* The future fruit of the seen and the fruit here of the unseen of the |
rajasika mode though seem similar yet are different. As the food will bear fruit
in the form of diseases, that is future fruit of the seen. But the sacrifice which
is performed so that a son may be born bears fruit here in the form of the birth Te
of a son by turning itself into fate. So it is the fruit here of the unseen.
Tif the rajasika people's ostentation is excessive (17/12, 18), it may be
conducive to hells.
tIn heaven also there are three categories—high, middle and low. Those
who belong to the high category have vanity, because they are superior to the :
other two types and they are envious of those who are of the same category.
| Similarly those of middle class are proud as they consider them superior
to those of the low class and have a burning sensation having seen the superior
heavenly luxunes of those of the high class.
In the same way those of the low class are envious and jealous of the
other two classes as well as of their own class and they are proud when they
think of those who have not attained heaven.
"
1867,"Verse 22] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI | 1815 ;
gods, is. pained, because of atrocities of demons. Moreover, he :
has a burning sensation, in his heart when he beholds anyone
performing penance, because he thinks that the person is doing

so, in order to usurp his throne. Now, the question arises, why -
has he to suffer this burning sensation, when he is purged of |
those sins, which are obstacles to heavenly enjoyment (9/20).

The answer is, that it is the fruit of his violence of animals, |
which he commits, while performing sacrifice. - ,

Secondly, all actions performed with an interested motive, are
tainted: with some blemish, as fire is clouded by smoke (18/48). -
When all action are clouded by defects, there should be many more -
defects, in the actions which are performed for their fruits. So, -
in the scriptures, it is mentioned that after performing a sacrifice, |
the person should express penitence. But through penitence, all
the sins do not perish; their signs are left, in the same way, as -
dirt remains in the threads, even when a cloth is washed with
soap. So, even the gods such as Indra, has to suffer, by facing ee
unfavourable circumstances.

Actually, all defects perish, only when a person discharges 7
his duty, without expecting any fruit and surrenders those _
actions, to God. When he realizes that he is only God's, all his
sins of millions of ages immediately disappear.* Lord Rama in _
the Ramacaritamanasa declares, ""As soon as, a being has an _ ee
inclination for Me, his sins of millions of ages, disappear.""

Thirdly, Arjuna asked Lord Krsna, ""By what is a man,

Their residence (of the three categories) in heaven is not permanent because
they have to return to the world of mortals when their merits are exhausted
(Gita 9/21) and they remain worried after thinking of it. .

*The evils such as envy and jealousy etc., are not the fruit of actions
of the past but they develop because of the impurity of heart. When a man |
performs actions prescribed by the scriptures in order to reap their fruit, |
his heart is partially purified which leads him to the heaven and heavenly
pleasures. But when a man has the only aim of God-realization, his heart is
thoroughly purified. :
"
1868,"1816 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 17 |
impelled to commit sin, as if by force, against his will?"" Lord
Krsna replied, ""It is desire (craving), it is wrath, born of the
mode of passion"" (3/37). It means,. that it is desire born of
the mode of passion, which forces a man, to commit, sins. So °
rajasika sacrifice, which is performed with a desire for its fruit,
may involve sins.

Persons, who perform rajasika and tamasika sacrifice, are of |
demoniac nature, while persons who perform sattvika sacrifice
have divine nature. But if a person, is attached to traits of divine
nature, this attachment too binds him (Gita.14/6).. |

Appendix—In the scripture it is related that in Kali age, :
offering charity is the only ‘Dharma’ (righteousness), therefore
charity given in any way, leads to salvation. It means that in Kali
age, performance of virtuous actions such as sacrifice, charity _
penance and vow (fast) etc., according to the ordinance of the
scripture, is difficult; therefore a person should inculcate the habit
of giving gifts to others without hoarding them for himself. So -
charity should be certainly made somehow or the other.

penance and gifts etc., should be performed, in order to please |
God, without expecting any reward whatsoever. Every action, has
a beginning and an end. Similarly, there is union and disunion, of
its fruit. But the Lord ever remains the same, without undergoing |
any kind of change. So, the expression 'Tat' denotes, that the Lord
ever remains, the same while the expression 'Anabhisandhaya |

So a striver, should ever remember the everlasting Lord, and

renouncing the feelings of '[ness and 'Mineness’, should perform,
the acts of sacrifice, penance and gift, by regarding them as His -
Own, with the power given by Him, for His sake only. This is
the real achievement of human life. So a striver, has to realize 7
God, Who is known as ‘Tat’, and he has to renounce affinity,
for the world which seems real.

Devotees of the Lord, uttering other names of the Lord such
as Rama, Krsna, Govinda, Narayana, Vasudeva and Siva etc., ee
begin their acts. All these names also denote the term, 'Tat’.

Seekers of salvation, perform various acts of sacrifice, —
penance, gift, pilgrimage, meditation, trance, chanting and
study of scriptures etc., for the Lord's sake by obeying Him, to |
please Him. The:reasons is, that all bodies, organs, minds, hearts,
souls etc., and also we belong, to the Lord. Thus our so-called,
property and riches, also belong to Him. So we belong to God
and God is ours and with this conviction, all actions, should be
performed, to please Him, only.

Appendix—The Lord by the term ‘tat’ (that) referring to
"
1872,"1820 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 17 :
distance and invisibility means that the Supreme Person is
‘alaukika’ (unearthly)—‘uttamah purusastvanyah’ (Gita 15/17).

but is an object of faith and belief.

‘The word ‘Sat’ is used in the sense of Existence Absolute and — ,
saintliness; and so also, O Partha (Arjuna), the word ‘Sat' is used,
in the sense of a praise-worthy, act. 26 |
Comment:—

‘Sadbhave'—The existence of God, is known as ‘Sadbhava’.
The Lord, Who is_ without attribute and endowed with attributes,
Who is formless and also with form, and His incarnations such — ne
as Visnu, Rama, Krsna, Siva, Sakti (Durga), GaneSa and Sun-
god—all are included with in, ‘Sadbhava’. Thus the Lord, Who
ever exists everywhere, and Whose names, forms and sports, are
innumerable, is 'Sadbhava’, (reality). /

'Sadhubhave'—The noble dispositions, of the mind, such as
compassion and foreiveness etc., which have been described in
various spiritual disciplines of different sects and which are conducive
to God-realization are included in 'Sadhubhave', (goodness).

'‘Sadityetatprayujyate'—The term, ‘Sat’, is used in the sense
of Existence Absolute and goodness. It means that the term ‘Sat’, 7
"
1873,"Verse 26] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1821
is used for the Lord, Who is permanent and unchanging and :
for, the divine traits such as truth, forgiveness, generosity and
renunciation etc., which are helpful in God-realization.
'Prasaste karmani tatha sacchabdah partha yujyate'—All :
noble deeds, which are conducive to God-realization, are said
to be praiseworthy. Similarly, all other rites, such as initiation of
sacred thread, marriage etc., as well as, charity and construction :
of wells, temples, hospitals etc., which are sanctioned by scripture,
are included in 'Pragaste karmani' (praiseworthy acts ). The word
‘Sat’, is used, in the sense of all these praiseworthy acts.
Appendix—Existence of God is called ‘sadbhava’ which never -
ceases to be—‘nabhavo vidyate satah’ (Gita 2/16). Generally all
believers accept that there has always been a singular power which
is above all, is the controller Supreme and is also immutable. How _
can the universe, which is kaleidoscopic and which disappears,
be said to be ‘is (existent)’ or permanent? The reason is that the
world, which is perceived and known by senses and intellect etc., -
neither existed in the past nor will exist in future and at present
is also perishing—this is everyone’s experience. The senses and -
intellect etc., by which the world is perceived and known also
belong to the same class to which the world belongs. Even then
it is surprising that the world in spite of being non-existent (‘not’) |
appears to be existent (‘is’) and permanent (constant). Had the ee
universe really existed, it would have not changed; and when it
changes, it means that it is non-existent. Therefore in fact this
existence, instead of being of the world and of the body, is of God,
in Whose light the non-existent world appears to be existent (‘is’).
The noble dispositions of the mind are called ‘sadhu bhava’. |
The term ‘sat’ has been used for noble dispositions because
they are conducive to God-realization. The noble dispositions
viz., virtues and good conduct are divine traits (divine nature).
The divine nature is ‘sat’ (real) while the demoniac nature is
‘asat’ (unreal). All the means which lead to salvation are ‘sat’
"
1874,"1822 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter17  -
and all the actions which are. conducive to. bondage are ‘asat’.
| All evils and misconduct are ‘asat’ while their renunciation is
‘sat’. Renunciation of the ‘asat’ (unreal) is ‘sat’.and acceptance _
- of the ‘sat’ is also ‘sat’. In fact as much need as there is of
"" the renunciation of the unreal, so much need is not there of
owning (adopting) the real. Without renouncing the unreal, the
real tacked from outside does not subsist. But by renouncing the
unreal, the real is revealed. Therefore by renouncing the unreal,
the real is realized. |
All the virtuous actions ordained by the scriptures such as
sacrifice, penance, charity, pilgrimage, vow or fast, worship and __-
marriage etc., being praise-worthy are ‘Satkarma’. But if these
praise-worthy actions have no affinity with God, they instead of
being called ‘sat’ (the real), remain merely actions ordained by __
the scriptures. Though devils and demons also perform virtuous
actions such as penance etc. Yet they lead to bondage and become
‘asat’ actions because they are performed with a selfish motive -
and are meant to harm others (Gita 17/19). By those actions
even if the Abode of Brahma is attained, they have to return
there from (Gita 8/16). Men, who work for God-realization,
don’t meet with an evil end (Gita 6/40) because its fruit is ‘sat’
(real). The actions which are performed for the welfare of all -
beings, by renouncing selfishness and pride, are indeed praise- = _ ,
worthy ‘Satkarma’. | |

Comment:—

'Yajiie tapasi dane ca sthitih saditi cocyate'—Steadfastness __
(faith), in praiseworthy action, such as sacrifice, penance and -
gift etc., is called ‘Sat’. So steadfastness in sattvika sacrifice,
sattvika penance and sattvika gifts, alongwith, promptness in
their performance, is called ‘Sat Nistha’ (Real faith). |

The term 'Ca' (and), denotes that besides steadfastness, as
mentioned above, faith in selfless service, hospitality, obedience,
truth, chastity, pilgrimage and performance of one's duty,
according to one's caste, creed and social order etc., is known ;
as, real faith. -

‘Karma caiva tadarthiyam sadityevabhidhityate'—Besides
these noble deeds, there are two kinds of acts—the mundane
and the spiritual, = 7

(1) All the acts of earning one's livelihood according to one's
caste and social order, such as teaching, business and farming _
etc., and also eating, drinking, sitting, standing, walking, awaking
and sleeping etc., are mundane. ;

(2) Meditation, adoration, utterance of the Lord’s name, loud
chanting and listening to the glories of the Lord, and the saints,
etc., are spiritual acts. ;

If both these activities, are performed with reverence and - -
faith, without expecting any reward by giving up one's comfort,
only for the Lord's sake, they become ‘Sat’. Such acts having
affinity with God, Who is Real, are included, in divine nature,
which leads to salvation. : oo |

If a piece of a pot is put into fire, the fire converts it into its
own form. It is the speciality of fire, that the shred takes the form
of fire. Similarly action, which is performed for God, becomes
Godly i.e., that action leads to God-realization. In fact, an action
by itself is insignificant, but because of its performance for
God, it has gained significance. | |
"
1876,"1824 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter17 ~
The Lord, by the term 'Tadarthiyam' means to say that all
spiritual practice of a striver, who wants only God-realization
or salvation, without having any craving even for the highest -
- heavenly enjoyments, becomes 'Sat'. In this connection, the :
Lord mentions that that none, who works for self-redemption or
God-realization meets with an evil destiny (Gita 6/40). Not |
only this, but He also declares—the seeker of Yoga of equanimity,
also transcends the fruit of actions performed with some motive,
as laid down in the Vedas (Gita 6/44). The reason is, that
actions perish by bearing fruit, but the spiritual practice |
(act) done, for the sake of the Lord, does not perish, rather it
becomes ‘Sat’ (Real).
Appendix—In the twenty-fifth verse of this chapter, there
is mention of the performance of actions without aiming at -
the rewards—‘anabhisandhaya phalam’. Now here is mention
of the performance of actions for the sake of the Supreme.
Those who want to attain salvation, act without aiming at the -
reward—‘moksakanksibhih’ (Gita 17/25) and those who want to attain
devotion, perform all actions for the sake of God (Gita 9/26—28). -
The action which is connected with God becomes, ‘sat’ viz.,
bears ‘sat’ fruit and also the action by renouncing affinity with
the ‘asat’ becomes ‘sat’. :

Link:—In the preceding verse, the Lord declared that
acts performed for the Lord's sake, become 'Sat' (Real). Now,
the question arises, what is the result of acts which are not
performed, for the Lord's sake (i.e., which are performed without .
faith in Him).

Whatever oblation is offered, whatever charity (gift), is

given, whatever penance is performed and whatsoever, is

done, without. faith, is called ‘Asat', O Arjuna, it is of no. avail

Comment:— |

_ 'Aéraddhaya hutar dattarh tapastaptam krtam ca yat'—If

acts of sacrifice, penance and charity, which are sanctioned by

scriptures, are performed without faith, these are called 'Asat’.

Demoniac people, do not believe, in the next world (hereafter),

rebirth, righteousness and God. They act against scriptures.

Sacrifice and penance, performed by them, are against the :

ordinance of scriptures. |
Now the question arises as to why they perform sacrifices

and penance, when they have no faith in them. The answer is, _

that they perform these to win praise, regard and honour.

. ‘Asadityucyate partha na ca tatpretya no iha'—An action,

such as sacrifice etc., which is performed without faith, is -

called 'Asat’. It is useless in this life, as well as, in the next.

If actions are performed, expecting a reward, with faith, -

according to the ordinance of scriptures, they bear fruit here,

in the form of riches, prosperity, obedient sons and chaste wife

etc., and hereafter, in the form of the attainment of heaven etc. ,

If they are performed, without expecting any reward, with faith -

and in accordance with scriptures, these having purified the

heart and lead to God-realization. But if these are performed |

without faith, they are of no avail, either in this world, or in ©

the next world. : |
Now, a question arises, that sinful acts such as injustice,

tyranny, fraud, falsehood and forgery etc., should not bear any

fruit, because these are performed, without faith and the person,

does not expect any reward. The answer is, that they bear fruit,

because whatever action is performed with attachment, bears

fruit, even though the doer (agent) does not want it. So, people |
"
1878,"1826 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter17  -
of demoniac nature, go.to demoniac wombs, and to hell. |
Any simple and insignificant act, if it is performed, without
expecting any reward, for the Lord's sake, becomes 'Sat', andleads  ~
to God-realization. But, if an important act, such as sacrifice and
penance, is performed with faith, and according to the ordinance
of the scriptures in expectation of reward, it perishes, by bearin gg.
fruit and does not lead to God-realization. If an act is performed
without faith, it becomes 'Asat’ i.e., it does not bear any fruit,
here or hereafter. It means, that in God-realization it is faith
(feelings), not an act, which has predominance.
Sadbhava (existence of God), Sadhubhava (noble dispositions __
of the mind), noble deeds, steadfastness in 'Sat', and actions for
the sake.of the Supreme—these five are called ‘Sat’, as these are
conducive to God-realization. ee | ~
Why do acts without faith become 'Asat'? The Lord, by
_His grace has described virtuous actions,.in the scriptures, so __
that a man by performing these, may attain God-realization. But
those actions turn to be 'Asat', when these are performed without
faith. Their faithlessness should induce the people to hell etc.,
but because actions performed by them, are good (virtuous), so
their actions are of no avail, i.e., they do not bear any fruit, and ;
this is punishment, for such people. __ Se
It is proper, on the part of a man, that he should perform
acts of sacrifice, penance, gift and pilgrimage etc., which are
sanctioned by scriptures, with faith, having no expectation for
fruit. The Lord, by His special grace, has bestowed upon us |
this human body, so that we may perform virtuous actions,
with faith for the Lord’s sake. Those actions, will prove to be
useful for the welfare of all beings, here as well as, hereafter.
So, such noble actions should be performed with faith, in order
to please God.

One, who knows the threefold faith, in the right perspective, :
will possess good faith and renounce, the passionate and the dull
ones. As soon as, he renounces the two (because of his good .
faith), he realizes his real and eternal affinity, with God, which

Eighteenth Chapter 7
INTRODUCTION
The Lord, in the thirty-ninth verse of the second chapter |
referred to Sankhyayoga (the Discipline of Knowledge) and
Karmayoga (the Discipline of Action). These two very disciplines
were mentioned in the third verse of the third chapter as Sankhya |
Nistha and Yoga Nistha. Arjuna wanted to know these two paths 7
(Disciplines). But, as Lord Krsna could not get an opportunity -
to explain divine nature and demoniac nature, from the seventh :
chapter to the fifteenth chapter, so Arjuna could not express his
curiosity, from the third chapter to the seventeenth chapter. — -
Having mentioned the two paths, in the third verse of the
third chapter, Lord Krsna in the first verse of the fourth chapter,
explained that He taught the imperishable Yoga, to the sun-god. -
Arjuna asked Him, how he could believe, that He taught the
Yoga to the sun-god because His birth, came later, while the -
birth of the sun-god was earlier. The Lord in response to his
question talked of His divine births (incarnations) and the Tattva
of Karmayoga. In the thirty-fourth verse of the fourth chapter,
He directed him to gain, that knowledge from men of wisdom, -
by obeisance, by questions and by service to them. Again, in the
forty-second verse of the fourth chapter, He commanded him to
establish himself in Yoga viz., Karmayoga (in the form of even-
mindedness). So Arjuna, at the beginning of the fifth chapter,
asked Lord Krsna which of the two, the path of knowledge or |
the path of action (Karmayoga), was decidedly better, for him.
The Lord, answered his question, in the fifth chapter and started
the sixth chapter on his own.
In the thirty-third and the thirty-fourth verses of the sixth
chapter, Arjuna put a question on restlessness (fickleness) of
"
1882,"1830 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
mind. The Lord, answered his question in brief. Arjuna, from the
thirty-seventh to the thirty-ninth verses, put the question, ""What
fate does a striver, whose mind wanders away from Yoga (at the -
time of death), failing to attain perfection in Yoga, meet with?"" |
The Lord, answered the question in the sixth chapter. In the last
verse of the sixth chapter, the Lord declared his devotee the best
Yogi among all the Yogis. The Lord, started the same topic in
the seventh chapter, where he described devotion, in particular.

Lord Krsna, at the end of the seventh chapter, while describing
His entire form, used the terms Brahma and Adhyatma etc. So at ”
the beginning of the eighth chapter, Arjuna put seven questions :
for the clarification, of those terms. The Lord, answered the
first six questions in brief, while He explained the seventh .
question—how He is to be realized at the time of death, in
detail. Then He described the topic, which was left, in the seventh -
chapter, in the ninth chapter and upto the eleventh verse of the
tenth chapter. Arjuna, was very much pleased,when he heard in _
the ninth, tenth and eleventh verses of the tenth chapter, of the
devotees and the Lord's compassion to them. So Arjuna, from
the twelfth to the eighteenth verses, praised Him and prayed :
to Him to tell him in detail about His power of Yoga and His
glories. Having described His tmportant glories, at the end of the
tenth chapter, He declares,""What need is there, O Arjuna, for the .
detailed knowledge ? I stand, supporting the whole universe, with - |
a single fragment of Myself.""Hearing these words Arjuna, prayed
to Him to reveal to him His cosmic form. Having revealed His
cosmic form, the Lord declared, that by unswerving devotion
He can be seen and known and even merged into. -

At the end of the eleventh chapter the Lord explained the
merits of devotion and before that also He explained the merits of
the worship of His absolute aspect (4/34—37; 5/13-—26; 6/24—28
and 8/11—13). So Arjuna at the beginning of the twelfth chapter
asked, ""The devotees who with their minds constantly fixed in :
You adore You and again those who worship the Imperishable
"
1883,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1831 -
and the Unmanifested—of these two, who are better versed

in Yoga?"" In response to his question Lord Krsna, explained
devotion and devotees, in the twelfth chapter, while worship -
of the Imperishable and the Unmanifested, in the thirteenth and ;
the fourteenth chapters. In the twenty-first verse of the fourteenth
chapter, Arjuna asked,""What are the marks of him, who has
transcended the three modes of nature? What is his conduct and |
how does he get, beyond the three modes?"" So the Lord explained

the marks and conduct of such a transcendental person, and also |
explained, exclusive devotion, as the means to attain that state. -
The Lord, started the fifteenth chapter, in connection with His ~
exclusive devotion. At the end of the chapter, He declared that

a person who knows Him, as the Supreme Person worships Him, ;
with his whole being (heart or spirit). He means that persons of

divine nature, worship Him. It connotes, that persons of demoniac -
nature, do not worship Him. Before this chapter also, in the :
fifteenth verse of the seventh chapter and in the twelfth verse -
of the ninth chapter, demoniac nature, while in the thirteenth

verse Of the ninth chapter, divine nature have been described, ;
in brief. So the Lord, started the sixteenth chapter, to explain

divine nature and demoniac nature in detail and explicitly.

Arjuna, put the question, at the beginning of the seventeenth /
chapter, on faith which was in connection with the Lord's - -
declaration, which he made, in the last but one verse, of the
sixteenth chapter. The Lord, answered his question by describing
the faith, of three kinds in the seventeenth chapter. Now Arjuna,
expresses his desire to know severally, the truth about the two |
paths of knowledge and of action, which were mentioned by :
Him, in the third verse of the third chapter.

Comment:— , —

‘Sannydsasya mahabaho tattvamicchami veditum tyagasya ca
hrsikeSa prthakkeSinisidana'—While addressing Lord Krsna as
""Mahabaho'"", Arjuna means to convey that being omniscient, He is |
able to explain all the topics. So He should satisfy his curiosity
in such a manner, that he may understand the topic easily. :

By addressing Him as 'Hrsikesa,’ Arjuna means that He is
the Lord of senses, and inner-controller, of all beings. So He :
should explain to him everything in connection with the nature :
of 'Sannyasa’, and ""I'yaga’, even if he does not demand. |

By using the term 'KeSinisidana’ he means, that as He frees
His devotees, from all troubles and problems, He should also -
remove his doubts.

Generally, a curiosity is expressed with two purposes, (i) to
translate it into practice, (ii) to understand the principle. Those, -
who want to understand the principle, can become learned by
possessing bookish knowledge, and can even write books, but :
they cannot attain salvation. But those, who after understanding
principle, translate it into practice, can attain salvation.* |

Arjuna also expressed the curiosity, so that, having known .
the principle, he may translate it into practice. a oo

The term 'Sankhya' used in the expression ‘Esa te'bhihita
sankhye' (Gita 2/39) has been termed 'Sannyasa’, here. The Lord,
regards the terms 'Sankhya’ and 'Sannydsa as synonyms—as in the :
second verse of the fifth chapter, He uses the term 'Sannyasah’,
in the fourth and the fifth verses the term 'Sankhya’', while in
the sixth verse again 'Sannyasa'. Therefore here also 'Sankhya’,
has been termed 'Sannyasa’.

Similarly the term, ""Yoga' used in the expression 'Buddhiryoge

* Having known the unreal as unreal a man cannot attain the real, so long
as he does not fix ‘Realization of the real’ as the topmost aim of his life.
"
1886,"1834 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 :
tvimarn smu’ (Gita 2/39) stands for the term 'Tyaga', used here.
The Lord regards the terms ‘Yoga’ and 'Tyaga', as synonyms
as—'Sangath tyaktva', in the forty-eighth verse of the second -
chapter and in the fifty-first verse of the same chapter ‘Phalarm |
tyaktva', in the third verse, of the third chapter 'Karmayogena
yoginam’, in the twentieth verse of the fourth chapter 'Tyaktva
karmaphalasangam’, in the fourth verse of the fifth chapter ""Yogau',
in the fifth verse, ""Tadyogairapi gamyate,' in the eleventh verse,
‘Sangam tyaktva’, and in the twelfth verse 'Karmaphalarh tyaktva’, .
and in the twelfth verse of the twelfth chapter 'Tyagat'. All these -
expression have been used for 'Karmayoga’. Therefore, Arjuna has -
used the term, ""Tyaga' for 'Yoga' 1.e., the Discipline of Action, here.
In fact, Sannyasa, consists in renouncing one's affinity
completely with matter through discrimination, while ‘Tyaga’, -
consists in giving up attachment for actions and their fruits. He,
who does not get attached to actions and their fruits, is said to :
have attained to Yoga (6/4). - |
Appendix—At the beginning of the third chapter, Arjuna
in a complaining mood told Lord Krsna his confusion between ""
Karmayoga and Jiianayoga; at the beginning of the fifth chapter
he wanted to know which of the two Yogas was better and here
he wants to know the true nature of the two. ,

The Blessed Lord said:

The wise, understand by Sannyasa, the giving up of all actions, |
prompted by desire; the learned, declare the abandonment of the
fruits of all actions as Tyaga. Some philosophers declare, that
actions should be given up as an evil, while others say, that acts .
of sacrifice, charity and penance, are not to be given up. 2-3 |
Comment:— ;

These are the four views of the men of wisdom— |

(1) 'Kamyanam karmanam nyasam sannydsam kavayo viduh'— -
Some men of wisdom, declare that Sannyasa means, the giving
up of all actions prompted by desire, to gain, the favourable and
to get rid of, the unfavourable. | -

(2) 'Sarvakarmaphalatyagam prahustyagam vicaksanah'—

Some learned people, declare that abandonment of fruits of all
actions, is relinquishment i.e., ""Tyaga' (relinquishment), consists :
in performing actions, without desire for fruits.

(3) 'Tyajyam dosavadityeke karma prahurmanisinah'— Some |
men of wisdom, declare that all actions, should be given up, -
as an evil.* : -

(4)'Yajiiadanatapahkarma na_ tyadjyamiti capare'—Some
philosophers declare, that other actions may be given up, but
sacrifice, gift and penance, are not to be given up.

The above-mentioned, four views can be divided into two
parts—the first and the third divisions are in connection with
‘Sannyasa’ (Sankhyayoga), while the second and the fourth

* According to the Sarnskrta grammar, the term 'Dosavat’ has a double
meaning—all actions should be given up as an evil and evil actions should
be given up. But here according to the men of wisdom, the former meaning
iS appropriate.
"
1888,"1836 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
divisions, are in connection with 'Tyaga' (Karmayoga). But in
these two similar divisions also, there is a little difference. In
the first division, actions prompted by desire, are to be given
up, while in the third division all the actions are to be given up. ~
Similarly, according to second opinion, there is abandonment of :
the fruit of actions, while according to the fourth one, other actions
except sacrifice, gift and penance, are to be abandoned. .

How is the Lord's view superior to those of other thinkers
is discussed as follows:—

(1)'Kamyanam karmanam nyasam sannyasam'—Here, all
actions prompted by desire are given up,* yet there remain :
obligatory actions, of daily routine and also those that are -
performed on special occasions or at places of pilgrimage etc.
Therefore this view is not perfect, because in it, neither the
renunciation of doership, has been mentioned nor has it been
mentioned, that one gets established, in the self. But in the Lord's -
view, both these factors are involved. In the seventeenth verse of
this chapter, there is mention of the renouncement of doership,
when the Lord declares, ""He, who is free from egoistic notion -

* Actions are divided into five kinds— | -

(1) 'Nityakarma’ —The daily activities as enjomned by the scriptures such |
as prayer in the morning, noon and evening known as ‘Sandhya’ and recitation
of ‘Gayatri mantra’ (the sacred Vedic hymn) etc.

(2) 'Naimittikakarma'—The actions which are performed, on account of |
some place of pilgrimage or special occasions etc., are called ‘Naimittika-
karma’. Actions sanctioned by scriptures, at the places of pilgrimage such as - :
Prayaga, Naimisaranya and Puskara etc., and on occasions, such as on the days
of eclipses, full moon and dark fortnight (Amavasya) and the eleventh day
of every fortnight (Ekadasi), as well as on the birthday and day of marriage
etc., are included in this category.

(3) ‘Kamyakarma’—The religious rites, performed in order to gain praise,
honour, son, riches, fame etc., and to get rid of diseases, poverty and other :
undesirable circumstances etc., are known as 'Kamyakarma’.

(4) 'Prayascittakarma’—Actions which are performed, in order to get |
rid of the sins of present or the past, are called actions of repentance i.e.,
‘Prayascittakarma’.

(5S) Necessary (obligatory) actions—The profession, such as farming,
business, service etc., as well as actions as eating, drinking, sleeping, awaking
etc., are regarded as necessary (obligatory) actions, of daily routine. ,
"
1889,"Verse 2-3] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 1837 :
and whose intelligence is not tainted.” Similarly, he remains -
established in the self, has been explained, when he declares, ""He

may kill all these people, he does not kill, nor is he bound.""

(2)'Tyajyam dosavadityeke'—In this view of the men of -
wisdom, -it is said that all actions should be given up, as an .
evil. But all actions cannot be renounced (Gita 3/5), and even
the body cannot be maintained, without action (Gita 3/8). So
the Lord, has called this sort of renunciation of one's duty, as
rajasika and tamasika (18/7-8).

(3) 'Sarvakarmaphalatyagam'—In this first view of
relinquishment, there is relinquishment of fruit i.e., relinquishment -
of desire.* Relinquishment of attachment cannot be included in -
it, because by doing so, the view of the men of wisdom and -
the view of the Lord become one. The Lord declares, ""Duties
must be performed, relinquishing attachment to action and to
its fruit"" (Gita 18/6). .

(4) 'Yajiiadanatapahkarma na tyajyam'—Sacrifice, charity and
penance, are not to be given up. But besides these three, there
is no mention of other actions, which one performs according to ~
one’s caste and social order etc., whether they should be performed
or not. So this view is imperfect. According to view of the
Lord, all duties and pious acts such as pilgrimage etc., must be
performed relinquishing, attachment and fruit (18/5-6).

PLOLDESES Ht .

Link:—Having cited the four views of the men of wisdom, on -
the subject of Sannyasa and Tyaga, in the preceding two verses,

* Where there is mention of relinquishment of fruit, there it should be
regarded as the relinquishment of the desire for fruit, because the fruit cannot
be relinquished. Every action, bears some fruit or the other. When a farmer -
farms a field, it will bear fruit, either desirable or undesirable. Similarly a
businessman, may gain or lose, as fruit of business. Thus success or failure,
is the fruit of action. But when a man relinquishes desire, his affinity for fruit,
is automatically renounced (Gita 18/12). Therefore, the Lord, has advised to
remain even-minded in success, and failure, and this even-mindedness 1s called
""Yoga' (Gita 2/48). This even-mindedness, means that the person should not |
be attached, to fruits of actions. —

addressing Arjuna, as the best of men, says that relinquishment
has been declared to be of three kinds—sattvika (good), rajasika
(passionate) and tamasika (ignorant). According to the Lord, the -
sattvika relinquishment, is real relinquishment. But, in order to
show the superiority of sattvika relinquishment, He has mentioned ;
the passionate and the ignorant forms, of relinquishment, also.
In discussing the threefold relinquishment He wants to convey,
that a striver should adopt only sattvika, relinquishment, by giving
up the rajasika and the tamasika, ones. |

from the seventh to the ninth verses.
As the Lord discriminates between the soul (the real) and the body (the
unreal) first of all (2/11—30) because the discrimination is very necessary for
a Yogi, similarly here he begins the topic of relinquishment of the desire of
fruit and attachment to action regarding it as indispensable for Yogis.

yajiiadanatapahkarma na tyajyarn karyameva tat

yajno danam tapascaiva pavanani manisinam

Acts of sacrifice, charity and penance are not to be given up, -
but should be performed; for these, (sacrifice, charity and penance) ;
are purifiers of the wise. 5
Comment:— - -

'Yajiiadanatapahkarma na tyajyarn karyameva tat'—Here,
the Lord has supported the view of the men of wisdom, (18/3).

He does not criticize any opinion, in harsh words. He takes the
right view of other thinkers, and adds his own belief to it. Here °
He supports the view of other thinkers, that sacrifice, gift and -
penance should not be abandoned. He adds His own opinion that
these should be performed, because they are purifiers of the wise. |

'Yajiio danamn tapascaiva pavanani manisinam'—Here the term
‘Caiva', denotes that besides acts of sacrifice, gift and penance, -
other acts of daily routine, in connection with body and occupation
etc., should also, be performed as they are purifiers of the wise.

Men, who endowed with equanimity, renounce the fruit of action, -
are wise (Gita 2/51). Even such men of wisdom, are purified by

acts of sacrifice, gift and penance etc. But the same acts, lead
those to bondage, whose senses are not under control, and who

perform acts, in order to enjoy pleasure.

In this verse the Lord, in the first half has used the compound -
expression 'Yajiadanatapahkarma’, while in the second half, He _ -
has given these as separate terms 'Yajio danarh tapah.’ Why? He
wants to convey in the first half, that acts of sacrifice, gift and
penance should not be abandoned but surely performed, while
in the second half He means to say, that each of these acts 1s
purifier of the wise.

Appendix—The term ‘manisi’ means thoughtful. The actions
which are performed, for the welfare of others, without having
any selfish desire, are purifiers viz., they having removed evils,
bad conduct and sins etc., are conducive to great Bliss. But if
those actions are performed in order to satisfy one’s own desire
and to do ill of others, they cause impurity viz., cause horrid

is My decisive and firm belief. 6 | | :
Comment:— | |
'Etanyapi tu karmani sahgarn tyaktva phalani ca kartavyaniti
me partha niscitarn matamuttamam'—Here the term ‘Etani’, denotes /
acts of sacrifice, gift and penance, mentioned in the preceding
verse, while the term ‘Api’, denotes other acts in connection with,
one's occupation such as business and farming etc., bodily acts, _
such as eating, drinking, walking, sitting and sleeping-waking
etc., in accordance with, scriptural injunctions and other necessary
acts, of daily routine. If actions are performed, without having
any desire and attachment, for the welfare of others, the flow
of actions is towards the world viz., actions are not for one's
own self-interest at all, these are totally for the good of others.
Thus we get united with God. But if they are performed with -
attachment and desire, for fruit etc., these lead to bondage and
not allow the individuality to vanish. |
In the Gita, in certain contexts, there is mention of
relinquishment of attachment, while in others, the Lord talks
of relinquishment, of fruit of actions. Here, in this verse, both |
are mentioned together. It means, that where there is a mention
of the one, the other should also be presumed. So a_ striver,
should neither be attached to action, nor to the fruit, of actions.
By doing so his attachment for the mind, intellect, senses, body
and other possessions, is shaken off (Gita 5/11).
Attachment is subtle, while desire for fruit of action, is gross.
"
1893,"Verse 6] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1841
The attachment of sentient soul, to insentient and perishable world,
leads the soul to its birth, in good and evil wombs (Gita 13/21).
As soon as this attachment is relinquished, a striver, realizes his _
natural detachment. — |
Philosophers differ, in their views about the universe. Some
of them regard it as unreal, like a dream, others hold it, as
kaleidoscopic like a body, while still some others believe, in
its existence, like water, which always remains in the form of
snow, cloud, vapour etc., but never perishes. Thus they hold
different views. But they all agree, that perishable matter has .
no affinity, with the imperishable self. So a striver, instead of
being entangled in discussions and arguments, whether matter -
is real or unreal, or beyond the real and the unreal etc., should
give up affinity, with the universe, an evolute of Matter. In fact,
the universe including, this body is ever undergoing a change, -
while the soul ever remains the same, without any modifications.
A striver, has to realize this fact.
Whatever circumstances, we are placed in, are the fruits of -
actions performed, in the past; and actions we are performing
now, will bear fruit, i future. So a striver, should neither be
attached to persons and things he possesses, nor have a desire :
for what he expects to receive, in future. He should not have
any desire, for fruits.*
Why should, the desire for fruits of actions be given up?
The reason 1s, that actions have a beginning and an end and so 7
has their fruit. So desire and attachment, for the fruit should |
be given up. Actually, there is no attachment, in the self, it is
merely assumed. :
In reality we cannot give up, what is ours and also cannot .
give up, what is not ours. We cannot give up the self, as fire
cannot give up heat, and light. We also cannot give up the things
belonging to others in this world. We can give up things, which
*The term 'Phalani’ has been used in plural number because such people
expect the fruit in the form of comforts, luxuries, praise, honour and fame
etc., here and in heaven hereafter. According to the opinion of the Lord, desire
for all these fruits should be renounced. : |
"
1894,"1842 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 5
are not ours but we have only assumed these as ours. We have
assumed matter and its evolute, and the body as ours. So we
have to give up this assumption. => = :
A man, should discharge his duty, very carefully and promptly, :
by giving up attachment and desire, for fruits, according to the
ordinance of scriptures, whether it is significant or insignificant.
The reason is, that when we are not concerned with its fruit, no |
question arises, whether the action is trivial or significant, and
whether it bears meagre or rich fruit. An action, appears to be
superior or inferior, due to desire for fruit, while in Karmayoga, -
the desire for fruit, is to be renounced. A follower of the Discipline -
of Action, performs action to get rid of attachment. In the Gita,
it is mentioned, ""Action is said to be the means of the sage, who ""
wishes to attain to Yoga (in the form of equanimity)” (Gita 6/3),
""Not by non-performance of actions does a man, attain freedom -
from action"" (Gita 3/4). When he performs action for himself,
he gets attached to it. So a striver, following the path of action,
performs actions for the welfare of others. With his physical body, ~ :
he does good to others, with his subtle body he thinks, of the
welfare of others, and with the causal body his trance, is also 7
meant for the welfare of others. By doing so, his attachment
for action, is easily wiped out. Attachment is the only obstacle
to God-realization. As soon as a Karmayogi, gets rid of this
attachment, he realizes God automatically (Gita 4/38).
The term 'Kartavya’, stands for action which we can perform,
which must be performed and which is conducive to perfection.
The aim of this human life, is to attain perfection, not to enjoy
pleasure or suffer pain. Even other beings, such as birds, beasts, |
creepers, moths, trees and plants etc., come across favourable and
unfavourable circumstances, in the form of pleasure and pain. But
they do not know what actions, they must perform. Moreover,
they have got no right, to attain perfection. The Lord, declares
that this is His decided view, in which there is no room for
doubt, and.also this is His best view, which is perfect, according |
to scriptures and which is conducive to perfection.
Appendix—In this verse there is mention of relinquishment of CB
"
1895,"Verse 7] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1843 .
attachment to actions as well as to their fruit—both. Attachment |
to action and to its fruit is the main bondage, having relinquished

which a man attains Yoga viz., becomes Yogarudha—‘yada hi -
nendriyarthesu na karmasvanusajjate’ (Gita 6/4). :

Virtuous actions performed in only a disinterested way |
lead to salvation. But if virtuous actions are performed with an
interested motive, they are conducive to bondage—‘abrahma- a
bhuvanallokah punaravartino’rjuna’ (Gita 8/16).

Link:—The Lord, in the fourth verse of this chapter, declared -
relinquishment, to be threefold. So, in the next three verses, He a
describes them.

| Verily, the renunciation of any duty that be prescribed, is not
proper. Its abandonment (tyaga) through delusion (ignorance), is ~
declared to be tamasika (of the mode of ignorance). 7
Comment:—

[The Lord, describes the threefold relinquishment, because :
Arjuna wanted to abandon his duty (Gita 2/5). So Lord Krsna, -
by explaining the threefold relinquishment wanted to warn
Arjuna and other human beings, that one should not abandon
one's duty, but should abandon attachment to it and also, it's
fruit. This abandonment, is called sattvika abandonment, which
leads a man, to freedom from worldly bondage.

Also, the Lord, in the seventeenth chapter described faith and
food etc., of three kinds. So here also, He describes abandonment
of three kinds.]

'Niyatasya tu sannydsah karmano nopapadyate'—The Lord
in the preceding verse, explained His decisive and firm belief.
"
1896,"1844 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 ~
But this tamasika abandonment, is quite contrary and inferior,
to that. So the term 'tu' (verily), is used here.

Duty that ought to be discharged, must be discharged. One's =
profession, according to one's caste and social order, hospitality,
sacrifice, prayer and recitation of Gayatri mantra (the sacred
Vedic hymn) and such other acts, should not be abandoned. Such |
abandonment if resorted to, is Tamasika and, is the abandonment
of ordained duty (Niyata Karma).

'Mohattasya parityagastamasah parikirtitah'— Abandonment
of any such act, out of delusion (ignorance), is declared to be :
tamasika. Not to attend, an urgent meeting or divine discourse, -
not to attend to sick parents; not to attend the court, at the right .
time and such other negligence, out of heedlessness, idleness and
laziness, are examples of tamasika abandonment. -

What is the difference between 'Vihita Karma’ and 'Niyata
Karma?’ All actions, which are sanctioned by scriptures, are called |
'Vihita Karma’. All those actions sanctioned by scriptures cannot -
be performed, by a person because there is mention of several
fasts, on all dates and days. If a man observes all those fasts, .
when will he have meals? But, out of those action sanctioned
by the scripture, the duty that ought to be done, according to
one's caste, (social order), stage of life and circumstances, is |
called 'Niyata Karma’. All the occupations of the four castes _
(Varnas)—Brahmana, Ksatriya, Vaigya and Sidra, are included
in the 'Niyata Karma’.

If one's duty is abandoned, out of delusion, it is tamasika
abandonment, and if it is abandoned, in order to gain pleasure
and rest, it is rajasika abandonment. But if the duty is discharged :
by abandoning the desire for fruit and also attachment to it, it
is sattvika abandonment. It means, that a tamasika person gets
entangled in delusion, a rajasika in comforts and luxuries, while
a sattvika person, discharges his duty carefully, without expecting
any reward. A person abandons his affinity, with actions and their |
fruits, because of this sattvika nature or sattvika abandonment,
"
1897,"Verse 8] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1845 -
not the rajasika and the tamasika ones. In fact, the latter two,
are not abandonment, in the true sense of the word.

A layman regards abandonment of actions, as real ~
abandonment. But according to Lord Krsna, real abandonment :
consists in abandoning attachment, and desire, which lead to
bondage (Gita 13/21). -

If external abandonment, is regarded as the real abandonment, |
every dead person should attain salvation, because he abandons
ali the worldly possessions, as well as his body and he does
not even remember, them. Therefore internal abandonment of :
attachment and desire etc., is real abandonment, which frees a 7
man, from bondage. |

Appendix—A man is more responsible to discharge his
prescribed duty than to perform actions sanctioned by the _
scriptures. As the act of ‘watching’ by a watchman and ‘the supply
of water’ by a water-hut-man are their duties—‘niyata karma’
for which they are specially responsible. If a person abandons -
his duty, he is considered very much guilty for 1t. Renunciation
of one’s duty leads to commotion. Therefore a person should -
not abandon his duty whether he is paid more or less for it
or whether it provides him more comfort or less comfort. In
these days there is disorder in the society because people don’t
discharge their duty. If a person does not discharge the duty |
allotted to him, what will be its consequences for him? If the ee
duty is abandoned, out of delusion, it is Tamasa abandonment
and such a person sinks downwards to lower births and lower
regions—‘adho gacchanti tamasah’ (Gita 14/18).

He, who abandons action, because it is painful or from fear :
"
1898,"1846 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
of physical suffering, does not gain the reward of relinquishment
by practising such rajasika abandonment. 8
Comment:— -
""Duhkhamityeva yatkarma'— Rajasika people, think that all
the acts of sacrifice, penance and charity etc., sanctioned by the
scriptures, are painful because in performing these, there are so
many restrictions. Moreover, a lot of money has to be spent. They
hold this opinion, because they have no faith in the scriptures,
the next world, and the actions prescribed by scriptures.
| 'KayakleSabhayattyajet'—Rajasika people, think that in the
performance of actions sanctioned by scriptures, and the social -
decorum, they have to suffer hardships, by foregoing bodily .
comfort.* They feel dependent and sad, while discharging their .
duty, according to their caste (social order), and stage of life, _
and in obeying their parents, teachers and masters. But, they feel
independent and happy, while they work according to their own
will. They do not want to be governed, by scriptural ordinances. —
They want to lead a lazy, idle and carefree life of a Sadhu, or
a pensioner, by abandoning household affairs,.which involve -
physical and mental effort.
Here, a doubt arises, that in gaining true knowledge, there is
mention of perception, of evil and pain (Gita 13/8) while, here it
is mentioned, that action which is abandoned, because it is painful -
or from fear of physical suffering, is rajasika relinquishment, and
here, relinquishment of action is forbidden. These two statements
seem contrary. The clarification is, that these are not contrary,
but the topics are different. There, it is mentioned, that one
should perceive evil and pain, in pleasure and so should abandon, ,
pleasure. But here, it refers to performing, one's duty. So duty
must not be relinquished, rather it must be performed. Perception
of evil and pain, in pleasure develops dispassion, which leads
. to God-realization, while relinquishment of one's duty, because
* A man feels physical suffering because of his attachment to the body
and the sense of mine with it.
"
1899,"Verse 9] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1847 :

it is painful or full of physical suffering, leads to bondage (Gita

3/9). Fruit of both the rajasika and tamasika relinquishment, is

tamasika, which leads people to sink deeply (Gita 14/18). >
Now a question arises, that a devotee, who attends divine °

discourses and listens to glories of the Lord, develops dispassions

and so he renounces daily duties and is absorbed in devotion, ,

and adoration, should his relinquishment not be regarded as |

rajasika? No, actually it is not so, because God-realization, is

the aim of human life. So if a striver, renounces other action,

and is engaged in devotion and adoration etc., he performs his -

real duty. He cannot indulge in heedlessness, and indolence. -

But,those who practise rajasika or tamasika relinquishment, will

indulge in evil propensities, such as heedlessness and indolence

etc., because they are interested in pleasure. | -
'Sa krtva rajasam tyagam naiva tyagaphalam labhet'— Peace,

immediately follows, renunciation. But a rajasika person, does

not attain peace, as fruit of his relinquishment, because, his —

relinquishment is meant to gain rest, comfort and luxuries etc., as this

can be seen, even in animals. So, such a person instead of attaining 7

peace, has to receive punishment, as a fruit of neglect, of his duties.
Appendix—Renunciation leads to ‘Supreme Peace’—‘tya-

gacchantiranantaram’ (Gita 12/12) and the fruit of attachment

is ‘pain’—‘rajasastu phalarhn duhkham’ (Gita 14/16). A person _. a

possessing the mode of passion does not attain peace, the fruit of

renunciation; but certainly suffers pain, the fruit of attachment.

Comment:— | : : ~
_ ‘Karyamityeva yatkarma niyatam kriyate'rjuna'—Here, the

particles ‘Iti’, and ‘Eva’, have been added to the term 'Karyam’,

7 which denote that the prescribed duty is only to be performed,
without any selfish motive, or desire for its fruit. By doing so, the
doer's affinity with action, is renounced. So action (duty), does
not lead him, to bondage. He is bound, only if he is attached,
to action and its fruit, (Gita 5/12). a

All duties,. which have been prescribed by the scriptures, -
according to. a person's caste, social order, position and |
circumstances etc., are included in the ‘Niyata Karma’. He
should discharge those duties, very promptly and enthusiastically, _
abandoning idleness, laziness and heedlessness. So the Lord,
in the context of the Discipline of Action, has used the term
‘Samacara’ (perform efficiently), (Gita 3/9, 19). -

- ‘Sangam tyaktva phalarh caiva'—He should not be attached
to actions, or the means (instruments) of actions, nor should he _
have desire, for the fruit. : ,

'Sa tyadgah sattviko matah't—Sattvika Tyaga, consists in.
relinquishing attachment for action, its fruit and also the desire, |
for its fruit. In rajasika relinquishment, actions are abandoned,
because these are painful, and they cause physical suffering; in
tamasika relinquishment, actions are abandoned, out of delusion,

* In the Gita where there is description of the three modes of nature (7/12;
14/S—18, 22; 17/1-2, 8—13, 17—22 and 18/20—28, 30—35, 37—39) the
order is Sattva, Raja and Tama, while here the order is reversed. The reason :
is—(i) If the Lord after the sixth verse (in the seventh verse) had described
Sattvika relinquishment; there would have been the repetition of the Lord's

- decided view and Sattvika relinquishment. (ii) Something is proved superior
if the inferior things have already been described. Therefore the Lord in order
to prove superiority of the Sattvika relinquishment first describes the Rajasika
and the Tamasika ones. (iii) In the verses tenth to twelfth there is description ,
of the Sattvika renouncer. So the Sattvika relinquishment is given in the ninth
verse so that they may be connected. ;
"
1901,"Verse 9] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1849 -
while in sattvika relinquishment, actions: are not abandoned,
but are performed carefully and promptly, according to rules
and regulations, without expecting any reward. By sattvika ~
relinquishment, our affinity with actions and their fruit, is
renounced, while in rajasika and tamasika relinquishment, it
seems that we are not at all concerned with actions, but actually |
internal affinity, is not renounced. The reason is, that in rajasika |
relinquishment, a man abandons actions, because these are painful
and they cause physical suffering. So one remains attached to
his comforts. Similarly, in tamasika relinquishment, when a man ”
abandons action out of delusion, he remains attached, to delusion. =
Thus even abandonment (relinquishment), leads to bondage, while
performance of actions promptly, in accordance with the scriptural |
injunctions, leads to emancipation. -
Appendix—In the mode of ignorance there is delusion
(ignorance), in the mode of passion there is selfishness; but in
the mode of goodness, there is neither delusion nor selfishness -
but there is renunciation of affinity. A Sattvika person performs |
the obligatory actions (prescribed duty) because they ought to be ;
done. There is a vital point which needs attention, and that is,
that when an action is performed as a matter of duty, the affinity
with it, is renounced. In the worldly disciplines (Karmayoga and
Jfianayoga) the breach of affinity with the body and the world |
is important. Therefore a striver should perform every action -
by regarding it as his duty. External abandonment of actions is
conducive to bondage but the performance of actions as a matter
of duty, without having affinity with them, leads to salvation.*
* In the unworldly discipline (discipline of devotion), affinity with God
is important. Therefore a devotee should not practise spiritual discipline such
as chanting or loud chanting the Lord’s holy names and meditation etc.,
with the mere sense of duty but should practise it, in a loving manner by
regarding it as service or worship to his dearest beloved, in order to please
Him. God’s everything (His name and Form etc.,) should be loving to him.
He should feel delighted while performing actions for God’s sake. As a
medicine is taken by a patient with the sense of duty but food is not taken
with the sense of duty but it is taken in order to satisfy hunger; similarly
"
1902,"1850 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter18  -
Here a doubt may arise that in this verse there is mention
of the performance of action rather than Tyaga (relinquishment),
then how is it ‘Sattvika tyaga’? The clarification is that ina  _
Sattvika doer, there is neither delusion, nor selfishness, nor ;
attachment nor desire for fruit; but he performs actions with
the sense of duty; therefore as the doer has no affinity with
the action, it is ‘Tyaga’ (relinquishment). Duty remains in the :
insentient division, in it there is no affinity with the sentient.
When a man (the Self) assumes his affinity with the body, then
he is connected with the actions performed with the body. If he ,
does not assume his affinity with the body but only discharges _
his duty, he will not be connected with actions. It is named -
‘Tyaga’ because in it there is renunciation of affinity with the
body and the world. In it there is renunciation of affinity with
both—the action and its fruit. -

which lead to rebirth (2/42—44; 9/20-21) and the prohibited

'Tyagi'—The real abandoner (renouncer), is he, who has neither _
aversion to a disagreeable action, nor attachment to an agreeable

the least, affected by action or inaction (Gita 3/18; 4/18). Such ~

can, an embodied being, abstain from actions? He may relinquish 7
acts of sacrifice, gift, penance and pilgrimage etc., but how could
he abandon eating, drinking, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping
and waking etc.? | | =

Again, internal relinquishment (relinquishment from the
heart), is real relinquishment. External relinquishment, is unreal
and temporary. A man, relinquishes external actions, in a trance. |
But this trance, is also an action, because in trance, affinity with
causal body, persists. So there is deviation in trance, also.

No one can remain inactive, even for a moment (Gita 3/5). -
Man, does not attain freedom from action, by non-performance -
of action, nor does he attain to perfection, by mere renunciation -
of action (Gita 3/4). |

A man being sentient, ever remains, uniform and immutable,
while Prakrti is mutable and kaleidoscopic. So long as, a man
is attached to prakrti and its evolute, the body, and identifies -
himself with it, he cannot abandon actions entirely, because he
regards actions of the body, as his own. .

Further a man has assumed his affinity with prakrti, by
neglecting discrimination. He has assumed the self, as the body
and the body, as his own. It is because of the assumption of |
egoism, and mineness, that the embodied being cannot abandon -
actions, entirely.

'Yastu* karmaphalatyagi sa tyagityabhidhiyate'—He, who
relinquishes his affinity for action and its fruit, is a relinquisher.

So long as he has his affinity with agreeable or disagreeable, |
good or bad action, he is not a relinquisher. When a man assumes
things and actions, as his own, he gets attached to them. Moreover,
he is also attached to fruits, of those actions. But, as soon as,

* Here the term ""Tu' denotes that the person who relinquishes the fruit
of actions is superior to common mundane people because his aim is God-
realization or salvation.
"
1906,"1854 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter18
his aim is to relinquish the fruit of action, all his actions are -
- directed, towards the welfare of the world. The reason is, that

he realizes, that he has received everything from the world, and

so everything belongs to the world. Besides, actions and their
fruits, appear and disappear, while he ever remains, uniform and
immutable. Having this sort of discrimination, he gives up the
fruit of actions, very easily. Such a person, who relinquishes the
fruit of action, is called a relinquisher. |

There neither was nor is, nor can be, nor is there any
possibility, of affinity of the immutable self, with the mutable
fruit of action. It is out of ignorance, that man has assumed this
affinity. As soon as, this assumed affinity, is renounced, he is _
called a renouncer. This can be explained by an illustration.

When a person renounces his kinsmen and becomes an
ascetic (saint), from his heart, prosperity, adversity or ruin of. _
the family, makes no difference to him. The reason is, that he
gives up his assumed affinity, with his family. This was a two-
way affinity—from his side, as well as, from the side of the -
family. But, as far as his affinity with prakrti is concerned, it is
only he, who has assumed this affinity, prakrti has not assumed
it. So, if he wants to relinquish this affinity, he can relinquish
it easily, without any doubt.

Appendix—This verse has been uttered from the viewpoint —
of Karmayoga. In Karmayoga there is renunciation of the desire —__
for fruit while in Jaanayoga—there is renunciation of the sense
of doership.

‘Relinquishment for the fruit of action’ means to relinquish
the desire for the fruit of action.-:The reason is that the fruit for
action can’t be renounced, as the body is the fruit of action, how .
will it be renounced? Having eaten food, hunger is satisfied,
how will this satisfaction be renounced ? Having farmed the land,
how will corn be renounced? Therefore in the Gita, renunciation
of the desire for the fruit (of action) has been mentioned as
relinquishment for the fruit of action.
"
1907,"Verse 12] : SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1855
In fact the external relinquishment is not real relinquishment
but the internal relinquishment is the real relinquishment. If a
person, having renounced the world, externally, goes to a solitary -
place, the body which is the seed of the universe, still remains .
with him. When a person dies, all things including his body
desert him but death does not lead him to salvation. Therefore .
our desires, the sense of mine and .attachment bind us, the
universe does not bind us. When we do nothing for ourselves,
our affinity with actions is renounced—‘yajnayacaratah karma
samagram praviliyate’ (Gita 4/23). -

Comment:— :
‘Anistamistam miSram ca trividham karmanah phalam'—An
action, bears three kinds of fruit—pleasant (good), unpleasant :
(evil) and mixed. In the world: generally, a. person reaps mixed
fruit for his actions. For example, when a man earns money,
by working hard, he gets the necessities of life, this is pleasant
fruit. But he has to pay income tax, or again, there is loss of
money, this is unpleasant fruit. It means, that his pleasure is
partial, and in unpleasantness there is a part of pleasantness, :
"
1908,"1856 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter18  -
because there is no creature, in the world, that is not bound by
the three modes of nature (Gita 18/40). This world, is a place
of sorrow or suffering (8/15, 9/33). But.no circumstances, are -
totally pleasant or totally unpleasant. There is predominance of
one or the other. In fact, the fruit of actions is mixed, because
all actions are clouded by defects (18/48). |
- ‘Bhavatyatyaginam pretya'—Common folk, not renouncers,
reap these three kinds. of fruit. Actually the actions and their
fruits, are connected with prakrti, not with the self, because the
body, senses, mind and intellect etc., are evolutes of prakrti.
When a man (self), performs. actions, being attached to them, he _~
has to reap pleasant, unpleasant and mixed fruits, in the form of
| favourable and unfavourable circumstances. These circumstances,
make him happy and sad which feelings bind him. -

He who feels happy, in favourable circumstances, cannot
escape sadness, in unfavourable circumstances. So long as, he
enjoys pleasure, he will have to suffer pain. He cannot be free, -
from. worry, sorrow, fear and agitation etc.

By the expression 'Pretya bhavati', the Lord means that those __ -
who, do not relinquish the fruit of actions, have to reap pleasant,
unpleasant and mixed fruits, after death. But by the expression
‘Na tu sannyasinarn kvacit' He wants to convey, that those, who
have relinquished the fruit of actions, have not to reap the fruit, = -
here or after death. It means, that the non-relinquishers do reap
the fruit after death, but they may also reap it here.

'Na tu sannyasinam kvacit'—Renouncers (relinquishers),
have not to reap the fruit of their actions, here or hereafter.
The favourable and unfavourable circumstances, as the fruit of __
actions, appear, but they are not-affected by them, because they
remain neutral. Moreover, they realize the reality, that the self
needs, neither action nor anything. They: perform all the actions,
for the welfare of others. Actions performed, with their physical
body, the thoughts possessed, with their subtle body and the
trance with their causal body—all are for the welfare of others.
"
1909,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1857 -

The reason is, that whatever they possess is of the world, and

so it is to be utilized for the welfare of the world. They commit

an error when they think of their own welfare, only. This is to -

keep his individuality intact. =.
Here, in the term 'Sannyasinam’' there is identity between the

relinquisher (Karmayogi) and renouncer Sannyasi (Sankhyayogi). A

Karmayogi, remains detached from actions, while a Sankhyayogi,

remains totally unconnected with, actions. A Karmayogi, has no

desire for the fruit of action 1.e., he has no feeling of mineness

with it, while a Sankhyayogi, relinquishes his egoism. If the feeling :

of mineness is renounced, the feeling of egoism, is automatically -

renounced. Similarly, the feeling of mineness, is renounced, with

the renouncement of egoism. So, in the context of Karmayoga,

the Lord has first mentioned the abandonment of, the sense of .

mineness, and then of egoism (2/71) while in Sankhyayoga, he ~

has reversed the order (18/53). In both, there is relinquishment

of affinity with prakrti and its evolutes. -
Arjuna asked Lord Krsna, that he desired to know severally,

the nature of renunciation, (Sannyasa) and of relinquishment .

(Tyaga). Therefore, the Lord by using the term 'Sannyasinam’;

wants to convey that a-Karmayogi, thinks that nothing is his,

nothing is wanted by him and nothing is to be done for him.

Similarly, a Sankhyayogi thinks that nothing is his and nothing

is wanted by him. A Sankhyayogt does not assume his affinity

with prakrti and its evolute, and so there is no need to say, that

nothing is to be done, for him.
Here, the Lord instead of, using the term “Tyaginam’, uses

the term ‘Sannyasinam’, in order to convey, that state of neutrality

which 1s obtained by men of renunciation, (Sankhyayogi) is also

reached, by men of action (Karmayogi) (Gita 5/4-5). Secondly, -_

till now the Lord explained, that a Karmayogi, remains detached

and neutral. Now, by using the term 'Sannyasinam’, He means to ~

convey that, He will explain how to attain that state of detachment,

or neutrality by Sankhyayoga. -

1910,"1858 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
oo An Important Fact in
Connection with Actions oo

'‘Purusa’ and 'Prakrti', are two distinct entities. 'Purusa’ is :
never subject to change while 'Prakrti', always undergoes change.
When a man, identifies himself with prakrti, or in other words
he identifies himself with the body then the actions done by his __
body become his actions. Further he develops, a sense of mine,
with the objects acquired. In this mineness, the desire for things
unacquired, springs. Till these evils, such as desire, mineness, _
and identification subsist, an activity is called an action. When — _
one renounces this identification, his actions do not bear fruit ~
for him, and turn into inaction. When a liberated soul, realizes -
the self, actions performed by his body are neutralized actions,
(Gita 4/18). Actually, all actions are performed, by the modes -
of nature. But, a man by identifying himself with prakrti (body)
thinks, ""I am the doer"" (Gita 3/27; 13/29).

Actions are of three kinds—Kriyamana* (actions of the —
present), Sancita (accumulated action of the several past human
lives, and also of this life til now) and Prarabdha (some of = -
the actions, whose fruit man has to reap, during this life, in the
form of favourable and unfavourable circumstances).

Knyamana Karma (actions of the present)
Fruit (These bear fruit) Sarnskara (Impressions) ;
| | (These leave impressions)
Seen Unseen |
Immediate In future Laukika Paralaukika :
(afterwards) (here) - hereafter
Pure (prescribed actions) Impure (prohibited actions)

*New actions can be performed only in human life and so are their
impressions (Gita 4/12; 15/2). Other lives such as of birds and beasts etc., are
only to reap the fruit of the past actions.
"
1911,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1859 ~

Kriyamana actions are of two kinds— Good and evil. Actions —
which are performed, in accordance with ordinance of scriptures,
are called good, while actions performed against ordinance of -
scriptures, out of desire, anger, greed and attachment, are evil.

These bear fruits, in two forms—direct fruit, and fruit in the
form of impression (influence). Direct fruit is divided into two |
kinds—seen and unseen. The seen fruit, can further be divided into
two—immediate and remote. As the immediate fruit of tasteful
food, is that it satisfies hunger and its fruit in future, is that
it gives strength. Similarly, he who eats chilli in excess, with -
food, has a burning sensation, in the tongue, mouth, throat, ears oF
and eyes. That is immediate fruit. It causes disease, in future,
and is future fruit.

Similarly, unseen fruit, can either be reaped here, or -
hereafter. Acts of sacrifice, gifts, penance, pilgrimage and
chanting etc., can bear fruit here, in the form of riches, sons,
praise and honour etc.,* and hereafter, in the attainment of -
heaven. Similarly, fruit of evil actions such as theft, robbery
and murder in the form of fine, imprisonment and execution is
unseen fruit, which is reaped here, while birth as birds, beasts, 7
insects and creepers, and residence in hell is fruit, which is
reaped hereafter.

In this connection, a point needs attention. If the fruit of |
evil actions, is reaped here, in the form of fine, imprisonment, :
insult and reproach etc., it will not have to be reaped hereafter.

The Lord is omniscient. He maintains a record of all the sins,

committed by a person, and the fruit, reaped by him. So, whatever
punishment is given, to a man is always just, because the Lord
is a disinterested friend, of every being. He being omniscient,

knows how much punishment he has suffered, as fruit of his

evil actions, and how much more he has to suffer. So pain or

*Here the future fruit of the seen and the mundane fruit of the unseen
seem similar yet are different. The future fruit of the seen is reaped direct .
without becoming ‘Prarabdha' while the mundane fruit of the unseen is reaped
by becoming 'Prarabdha’.
"
1912,"1860 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter18 ~-
punishment, that is inflicted upon a person, is the fruit, of his
sinful action.*

* In this connection I heard an anecdote. There was an honest gentleman = -
in a village. In front of his house there was house of a goldsmith. One day
some customers gave a lot of gold to the goldsmith, to prepare ornaments. .
The constable on night duty, came to know about it. So at night he murdered
the goldsmith and wanted to run away with the box full of gold. The honest
gentleman, saw him going away. He caught him red handed, and challenged
him. The constable wanted to pacify him, by offering him a share of the gold.

But he did not agree, because he was honest. The constable whistled and
having heard the whistle several other constables, came there. They caught the
honest man. He was charged with murder and theft. A case was filed against -
him. When he was presented before a magistrate, he tried to argue, that it ;
was not he, but the constable who was a criminal. But other constables also -
confirmed, that he had been caught red handed by them, committing a theft,
having committed the murder. ;

The magistrate after listening to the statements of all of them finally
gave a judgement, that the gentleman would be hanged to death. The -
honest gentleman muttered, ""In the domain of the Lord there is no justice.

I am going to be condemned to death, while the real culprit, is set free.""

The magistrate heard his words. He was somehow convinced, that he was
speaking the truth. So he made a plan to testify the truth of his words. —
Next morning, a person came crying, that his brother had been murdered.

So the culpnt should be traced. The magistrate, ordered those two men, to bring

the dead body. The dead body was lying on a cot, his body was stained with -
blood and he was covered with a long piece of cloth. When they were carrying

the cot, the constable said to the prisoner,""If you had agreed to my proposal,

you would have received a share of the gold, and also escaped death."" The |
prisoner said, ""There is no justice in the domain of God, because an honest .
man has to suffer and a criminal, is set free.""

The man lying on the cot was listening to their conversation. When -
the cot was put down the person removing the stained clothes stood up and
he narrated the conversation, between the constable and the prisoner, to the
magistrate. The magistrate was wonder-struck. He sentenced the constable to
imprisonment. The magistrate, was also very honest. He never took a bribe. So .
he called the gentleman, in loneliness and said, ""In this case you are innocent,
but tell me frankly whether you have committed any murder, during the life.""
He replied, ""There was a man of immoral conduct, who had illicit relations
with my wife. I requested him not to come to my wife, in my absence. One
day when I came back home, I found him with my wife. I lost self-control,
murdered him and threw his dead body, into the river. No one knew this
incident."" The magistrate said, ""I was perplexed, how I could give the wrong
judgement when I always perform my duty, very honestly and sincerely."" So
the magistrate sentenced him to death, for his past crime and the constable
was also condemned to death. .
"
1913,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1861 -

Similarly, if a man reaps the fruit of his virtuous actions here, -

in the form of riches, honour, praise and freedom from sickness
etc., he does not reap it, in the next world. The present actions,
leave two kinds of impressions, pure and impure. Prescribed -
actions leave pure and holy impressions, while prohibited actions, ,
give impure and unholy impressions. These impressions, form a
man's nature (habit). When impure impressions are rooted out, °
a man’s nature, becomes pure and holy. But because of past
actions, even liberated souls, are found different in their nature,
though their actions, are pure and are conducive to salvation, -
for the entire world.

The nature (habit), which is formed by impressions of the ~
past actions, is very strong and this cannot be easily rooted out.*
Similarly, people of different castes perform actions according
to nature of their castes, (Varna). So Lord Krsna says to Arjuna, _
""That which, through delusion, you don't wish to do, bound by
your own acts born of your nature, you will helplessly perform""

(Gita 18/60). -

A serious thought, is to be given to this pertinent remark.

It is said that the personal nature of a man, sways him and he -
cannot overpower it. On the other hand, it is said that every
human being, is free to do any action, and so he can get, through
his efforts, what he likes. The question is, which of the two is =
more powerful personal nature, or freedom of action. The answer -
is, that the two are two different matters: They have their own
importance and power, in their own context. Nature, described
in the sixtieth verse of the eighteenth chapter, is personal nature,
pertaining to caste. A human being's nature, is formed according :

Thus, if a person suffers punishment, for his crimes here, he has not to :
suffer it, in the next world. Here, in the world the punishment is generally
mild, while in the next world, it is more severe (it is with interest). But a
person, has to suffer punishment either here or hereafter.

* A tiger remains satisfied, in a dense forest, a lion likes a dense cave; a
swan, likes a blooming lotus; an eagle likes a cremation ground, a gentleman
wants to live with other gentlemen and a mean fellow, wants to accompany ”
mean persons. It is true that a man does not give up his nature. SS
"
1914,"1862 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
to the caste he is born in, and the sperm and ovum his body is
constituted with. That nature cannot be changed, and need not
be changed. Even scriptures do not advise to change it. A man, -
is to work under nature's sway. But in personal nature, there is :
impure part of attachment and aversion. God has given a man, |
power to wipe out his impure part. He is free to make his nature
pure, by wiping out attachment and aversion. Either through the |
practice of 'Karmayoga’, as enunciated in 3/34 or through practice
of devotion, by surrendering himself to God, he can make his
nature, quite pure (18/62). Thus both the forcefulness of personal
nature and independence of a man to act, are proved. It means, that _
a man is free to purify his nature, while personal (pure) nature, 7
is effective in engaging a man in actions, according to his caste.
The sharp edge of a sword made of steel, turns to gold, if it
is touched with the philosopher's stone (Parasa), but its sharpness, --
edge and shape do not undergo any change. Similarly, when a
man's nature is purified, his actions, are also pure. But he may
perform actions, according to his caste (social order), stage of -
life, religion and beliefs etc., and so his actions, may be different
from, others. If a man of the priest class attains salvation, he 7
will maintain more purity, than a man of the labour class, who
has also attained salvation. It is so, because of their nature. But
this nature, is not defective. So, it need not be wiped out. |
A man has to follow a cycle of birth and death, and he is .
born in good and evil wombs, because of his nature, of assuming
affinity with the matter. A man, is free in purifying his nature,
by rooting out desire, attachment and identification, with matter.
When a man, having renounced his egoism, takes refuge in the 7
Lord, his nature is purified, in the same way, as iron is purified
and turns into gold, when it is touched with a philosopher's stone.
When a man's nature, is purified, he does not incur sins, by
performing actions, ordained by his own nature (Gita 18/47). When
a devotee takes refuge in the Lord, he has no affinity with prakrti
(matter) and the Lord's nature, descends on him. As the Lord is
a disinterested friend, of all beings (Gita 5/29) he also becomes
"
1915,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1863 =
disinterested friend, of all beings (Srimadbhagavata 3/25/21).
Similarly, when a Karmayogi renounces attachment and
aversion, his nature is purified. Then, actions by him, are =
performed for the welfare of the world, automatically. When :
his actions are performed for the welfare of the world, he gets
identified with the power of God, because the Lord, is ever /
engrossed in the welfare of all beings. Actually, this power of the
Lord is open to all human beings. But egoism, attachment and
aversion, become the stumbling blocks, in approaching it. As soon
as, these are renounced, the Lord's power, starts operating. -
Sancita Karma (Collected actions or accumulated actions) -
Fruit Samhskara (Impressions)
Prarabdha Destiny) Sphurana Fleeting Thought)
Actions performed, during past lives and till now, are
called ‘Accumulated actions' (Saficita Karma). They consist of -
two portions—fruit and impressions. These are stored in the :
inner sense. The fruit-portion, forms 'Prarabdha’, and from the -
impression-portion (Sarhskara) these are mere fleeting thoughts,
(Sphurana). Accumulated actions performed, in the present life
are more responsible for inspiration to action. Rarely accumulated
actions of past lives, also cause such inspiration.* For example, if -
in a pot we store onions and then place wheat, gram and barley
in it, while taking out these commodities from the pot, what
was placed last, comes out first. But sometimes pungency of
onions, is also experienced. This example is not fully applicable, :
as these commodities are manifest, while accumulated actions -
* A thought comes to the mind according to the Saficita Karma as well as
the Prarabdha. The thought of the Saficita Karma can't force a man to perform
an action. But if there are attachment and aversion in it, it by becoming a
Sankalpa (Projection or Pursuit of the mind) can force him to act. The Sphurana
of Prarabdha forces a man to act in order to enable him to get the fruit of |
past actions. But by applying his discrimination he should check himself from |
performing prohibited actions and he is free in doing so.
"
1916,"1864 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 °
are unmanifest. This illustration, is to bring home the point, that
generally there are inspirations to actions, through accumulated
actions of the present life, and these are rarely through accumulated =
actions, of past lives. . , |

In dream (sleep), also the unfulfilled thoughts (ambition) of

_ Saficita are revealed.* In a dream there is no order and system. ,
You may have a dream and see the city of Delhi in which there
is a market of Mumbai and the shops of Kolkata. Similarly, you
talk to a man, who is either dead or alive.

In the state of wakefulness, different thoughts come to mind. ;
When one's intellect, loses control over his body, mind and senses -
etc., his utterances, are non-sensical. In that state, he cannot
discriminate, between the night and wrong. In absence of proper
functioning of his discriminative faculty, he is called a plain _
madman. But, when his body, senses and mind are under control,
he speaks a sensible language. He is like a wise, madman.

So long as, a man does not realize God, sphurana come to -
his mind. But when he realizes God, evil thoughts are altogether
rooted out. So evil thoughts, never come.to the mind of a liberated
soul. He never speaks and acts, against the ordinance of scriptures,
even in a state of unconsciousness or insanity, because his inner
sense, 1s purified. | |

*In the state of wakefulness also there are three states—wakefulness, sleep -
and sound-sleep. When a man acts being alert, that is the state of wakefulness.

- But if any other thought, comes to his mind, that is sleep in wakefulness. But
sometimes he is in such a state where he has no inclination to act, that is the
state of sound-sleep in wakefulness. |

It is because of the momentum to act that in the state of wakefulness, the
state of sound-sleep is rarely seen. But if a striver can adopt and maintain this -
state of sound-sleep in wakefulness, he will quickly progress in the spiritual path
because in that state he is identified with God or the self. Though in sound-sleep
also his connection with the world is renounced, yet he can't realize the self
because his intellect merges in ignorance. But when a man is in the state of sound-
sleep in wakefulness, he realizes the self because his intellect remains awake.

This state is superior.even to trance because it happens naturally while
in trance the mind has to be concentrated through practice and his egoism
also persists. Se

7 Prarabdha Karma (Destiny) :
Favourable Mixed (Favourable & Unfavourable ee
circumstances unfavourable ones) circumstances
OO
self willed = action willed |= Unwilled action (action
action by other willed by destiny) |
Out of accumulated actions, actions which are inclined to
bear fruit, are called 'Prarabdha’ (destiny). Destiny bears fruit, -
in the form of favourable and unfavourable circumstances,
through (i) self-will, (11) the will of destiny and (iii) will of -
others. Examples:— | |
(i) A man buys some goods and makes a profit or sustains
loss, as fruit of his 'Prarabdha'. But he buys the goods, by his —
own will. (ii) A person finds a purse full of gold coins, all of a
sudden or he injures his arm. when the branch of a tree falls on
him. It is the fruit of his destiny, through the will of destiny. -
(iii) A boy is adopted by a rich man, and the boy, becomes
an owner of the rich man's property. Similarly, a man's wealth .
is stolen by thieves. It is the fruit of one's, destiny by the will
of others. |
Destiny results, in the form of favourable and unfavourable
circumstances, but it does not force a man to perform forbidden .
actions. If a person is forced to perform prohibited actions, as
the fruit of his 'Prarabdha,' the ordinance of scriptures, for the
prescribed and prohibited actions, will be of no avail. Secondly,
if he goes on performing prohibited actions, according to his |
destiny, there will be no end to his prohibited actions. :
The 'Prarabdha Karma’, results in two sorts of fruits—acquired
and unacquired. The favourable or unfavourable circumstances,
which a person has got now, are called ‘acquired fruit’; while
during this life, such circumstances which he is going to get, |
in future, is called 'unacquired fruit’.
"
1918,"1866 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18

Destiny can bear fruit, in the form of favourable and ;
unfavourable circumstances, either at present, or in future.
Actions which are performed at present are added to -
accumulated actions. So long as, there are accumulated actions,
there is destiny, which acts im favourable or unfavourable
circumstances. These circumstances cannot force a man, to be
happy or sad. It is his affinity, with the circumstances, which |
makes him happy or sad. If by applying his discrimination, he
does not assume his affinity, he can remain equanimous.

Whether favourable or unfavourable circumstances, which a .
man faces in his life, are the result of 'Prarabdha' (Destiny) or of _
‘Purusartha’ (Present efforts). In this connection, there are many -
doubts. Before getting a satisfactory answer to this question, it is :
necessary to understand, what is 'Prarabdha’ (Destiny) and what
is ‘Purusartha’ (Effort or labour). -

A man has desire of four kinds—for 'Artha’ (Wealth), ‘Dharma’
(Righteousness), 'Kama’' (Passion) and 'Moksa’ (Salvation).

(1) Artha (wealth)—Wealth is of two kinds, unmoving and -
moving. Gold, silver, money and property etc., belong to the
former kind, while cows, buffaloes, horses, camels, sheep and -
goats etc., belong to the latter. .

(2) Dharma (Righteousness)—Acts of sacrifice, penance,
charity, fasts and pilgrimages etc., which are performed with
or without desire for their fruits, are included in, 'Dharma.' -

(3) Kama (Passion)—Mundane pleasures, are known as
‘Kama’. They are of eight kinds—Word (sound), touch, form,
taste, smell, honour, praise and comfort.

(a) Word (Sound)— Word is of two kinds—form of alphabets
(descriptive) and form of sound. Grammar, dictionary, literature,
novel, drama and story etc., are all alphabetical,* while musical

*There are ten kinds of sentiments in a descriptive word. These are of
conjugal love, humour, pity, wrath, bravery, dread, disgust, wonder, serenity
and affection. In all these sentiments, the heart melts. If these sentiments are |
inclined towards the Lord, these lead to salvation. But, if pleasure is derived
out of these, they are degrading.
"
1919,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1867 :
instruments relate to sound.* A person derives pleasure out of -
these alphabetical words and sound.
(b) Touch—Pleasure which is born of contact with wife, son .
and friend etc., and with skin, is pleasure by touch. ;
(c) Form—Pleasure derived by seeing movies, and other
beautiful objects., is pleasure in form.
(d) Taste—Pleasure that a man derives by tasting sweet,
salty and sour dishes etc., is pleasure through taste.
(e) Smell— Pleasure derived from the smell of oil, scents .
and flowers etc., is, pleasure, through smell. -
(f) Honour—A man derives pleasure when his so-called -
body is honoured. |
(g) Praise—One derives pleasure, when he is praised.
(h) Comfort— He gets pleasure or comfort out of idleness, -
laziness and comfort. |
(4) Moksa (salvation)—Self-realization, benediction, salvation -
and God-realization, are names, given to Moksa.
Out of these four, the two— wealth and righteousness, enhance
each other. But, if both of them are utilized to satisfy desire, -
after satisfying desire both of these perish. Desire devours both
these. So in the Gita, the Lord declares, that desire is insatiable
and He asks Arjuna, to kill this enemy viz., desire (3/37—43). ,
If righteous actions, are performed by renouncing desire, :
these after having purified the inner sense, lead to salvation.
Similarly, if wealth is spent for the welfare of others, abandoning
the desire for its reward, it also after having purified inner sense, |
leads to salvation. ;
Out of these four in 'Artha' (Wealth), and 'Kama' (Desire or
Passion) there is predominance of destiny. Purusartha is secondary
while in righteousness and salvation, there is predominance of
* Drums, tambourines and timbrels etc., made of skin, guitar and mandolin
made of wires, harmonium and flute etc., which are blown, and cymbal etc.,
which are clapped—these are musical instruments.
"
1920,"1868 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 ~
‘Purusartha' destiny is secondary (effort or labour). Their spheres
are separate and each has its own predominance in its own sphere.
Therefore, it has been declared— ;
A man should be satisfied with his wife, son, family, food -
and wealth, but he should never be satisfied with the study of
sacred books, adoration, chanting of Lord's name and charity.
It means, that a man gains wealth and pleasure, as is destined :
and so he should be satisfied with them. But he should never
be satisfied with, spiritual progress. He should go on labouring,
for salvation for which this human body, has been bestowed -
upon him. | -
Actions are of two kinds—good (virtuous) and bad (evil).
Virtuous actions result, in favourable circumstances, while evil :
actions result, in unfavourable circumstances. But these cannot
make a man happy and sad. It is out of folly, that a man -
feels, happy and sad. If he gives up his folly, by believing
in God* or in destinyf he feels happy, even in the most ;
unfavourable circumstances, as he gets rid of sins by facing
painful circumstances. Moreover, he becomes alert, and does
not commit sins, in future; and his inner sense is purified when ”
he gets rid of his sins.
A striver, should make the right use of favourable and
unfavourable circumstances. In favourable circumstances, he
should spend his money and material, for the welfare of others, °
he should not enjoy these. In unfavourable circumstances, he
should abandon the desire for favourable circumstances. He
should think, that he is getting rid of his sins, and the Lord by |
His grace, has caused such circumstances, so that he may be ;
careful not to commit sins, in future, and may progress in the
spiritual field. Thus, he should feel happy. This is the proper use
* As a mother remains ever compassionate never otherwise while fondling
and scolding her baby, similarly the Lord Who controls the virtues and vices
of beings, ever remains compassionate to everyone of them.
+ Whatever is to happen must happen and whatever is not to happen, will
not happen. A man having such a determinate intellect is never worried.
"
1921,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1869 7
of unfavourable circumstances, and if he feels sad, in unfavourable -
circumstances, this is their misuse.

The Lord, has not bestowed upon us this human life, to |
enable us to enjoy pleasure and to suffer pain. Heaven is the -
abode for enjoyment and pleasure while hell and eighty-four
lac forms, of lives are for suffering pain. But the aim of human
life, is to attain salvation by transcending pleasures and pains.
Those who remain negligent during human life, follow a cycle |
of birth and death. |

A man, is free in abandoning favourable circumstances but -
he is not free in abandoning unfavourable circumstances. This -
can be clarified, by an illustration.

Ramalala borrowed a hundred rupees from Syamaldla and .
promised that he would return the amount with interest, in a month.

But he could not return it. Syamalala, went to Ramalala's house, -
several times to demand payment as Ramalala had promised. But

he did not pay the amount. One day Syamalala lost self-control :
and beat Ramalala with his shoes. Ramalala filed a case in the
criminal court, against Syamalala. A summons, was issued to
Syamalala. He presented himself in the court. The magistrate -
asked him, ""Did you beat him with shoes?” Syamalala said,

""Yes, your honour. In spite of several promises he did not pay

my money. So he compelled me to beat him. I gave him five -
blows with shoes. Kindly order him to return my money, by :
deducting five rupees as a fine for five blows (with shoes).""

The magistrate smiled and said, ""This is a criminal court.

You will have to suffer imprisonment, or fine for your crime.

File a law-suit in the civil court if you want to get back your

money. The two courts, are different.""
Thus, the fruits of evil actions lead to unpleasant circumstances.

It is a case of criminal court and a man cannot escape it. But

as far as, the fruit of virtuous actions, in the form of pleasant

circumstances are concerned, that is a case for a civil court.

The two are different. They cannot nullify, each other. Thus
"
1922,"1870 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 ;
sins cannot be counter acted by virtuous actions. The two, are
accumulated separately. But if one performs any good act, in
order to repent, his sins perish. |
Some people complain, that there is no justice in the domain :
of the Lord*, because in this world, virtuous and good men are
suffering, while sinners are enjoying themselves. The answer is,
that virtuous persons are suffering, because they are reaping the
fruit of their past evil actions; their present virtuous actions, will |
bear fruit later. Similarly, sinners are reaping the sweet fruits of
their past virtuous actions, not of present sins. ;
Moreover, there is one more point, which needs attention. :
In favourable circumstances, a man is proud of himself, he hates
those whom he regards as inferior to him, and is envious of |
other persons’, better fortune. Thus externally, he seems happy
but actually he is not. On the other hand, an ascetic who is 7
dispassionate and a man of renunciation, and who possesses
neither wealth nor property, may seem sad, without possessions
to worldly people. But, actually his life is very serene and happy. |
So possessions and riches, do not make a man happy, and their
absence does not make him, sad. Real happiness, consists in -
serenity and happiness of heart, while sadness, consists in burning
sensation and sadness of heart. |
A man can be free from virtues, by surrendering them to :
God, without any desire for fruit, but he cannot get rid of sins,
by surrendering these to Him. One will have to suffer, the fruit of
those sins because actions against the ordinance of the Lord, cannot
be surrendered, to Him. This can be made clear by an illustration.
*In the Vana section of the Mahabharata there is an anecdote. One day os
Draupadi asked Yudhisthira, “You are suffering in exile following righteousness
while Duryodhana is leading a luxurious life by enjoying the kingdom in spite
of his unrighteousness and selfishness. Why?"" Yudhisthira replied, ""Those
who follow the path of righteousness in order to get pleasures, actually don't
know righteousness in the true sense of the term. They are just like animals
who hanker after pleasures without knowing righteousness. Therefore humanity
consists in following righteousness according to the ordinance of the scriptures
without caring either for the favourable or the unfavourable circumstances.""
"
1923,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 1871 -
Once a king with many other people, went to Haridwara.
Among the people, there was a wise businessman and a cobbler.
The cobbler, thought that he would also act in the same way, -
as the wise businessman would do. When the priest started the .
vowtaking-ceremony, the businessman said, ""I offer the charity
of a hundred rupees, which I lent to that Brahmana, to Lord
Krsna."" The cobbler, saw that the businessman gained fame, :
without paying even a single pice. So he wanted to do the same.
He said, ""I offer to Lord Krsna, the gift of a hundred rupees
which I borrowed from the trader."" By doing so he was very -
much pleased. -
After a few days at the time of harvest, the Brahmana came
to the businessman and requested him to take grain for a hundred
rupees and its interest. The businessman said that he had offered
- that amount to Lord Krsna, as charity, so he would not take tt -
back. When the Brahmana insisted, the businessman asked him to
offer it, as a gift to his own sister or daughter. So the Brahmana :
had to go home, without making any payment.
The trader, who had lent a hundred rupees to the cobbler, ;
went to him and demanded his hundred rupees. The cobbler said,
""T offered those hundred rupees, to Lord Krsna as the businessman
did."" The trader said, ""You can't get rid of this debt in this way, ;
you will have to pay me back, the amount with interest.” Thus ;
he got grain from the cobbler. |
It means that we cannot get rid of our sins and evil actions,
by surrendering these to God, we shall have to suffer for them.
But, if we surrender ourselves to God and take refuge in Him
alone, He liberates us from all sins"" (Gita 18/66). -
- A second doubt, arises that gaining of wealth does not
depend on destiny, because a man saves money, by foul means,
such as non-payment of income tax and sales tax etc. But, if
he pays full tax, the money is spent. So how does it depend on
destiny? The answer is, that if he is destined to gain wealth, he |
will gain it, by anyother means. But if he is destined to lose it,
"
1924,"1872 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
he will sustain a loss in every case, such as in disease, theft, and
litigation etc. Moreover, the impressions of foul means, such as
theft of income tax etc., live for so many lives and they instigate
one to commit thefts, and for which he has to suffer punishment. -
Similarly, enjoyment of pleasure is also pre-destined. A man
may possess a lot of money, but he may not enjoy pleasure due
to illness. He may have to eat very meagre meals as prescribed |
by a. physician. On the other hand, even a man who does not
possess much money, may relish tasteful dishes in the company
of generous friends, and kinsmen or by anyother means.* -

If a man is destined to gain wealth, he may be adopted by a -
rich man, or he may find it buried in the earth, while digging the
earth or by anyother wayt. But a man, neither believes in destiny,
nor depends on his hard work. So he is inclined to commit sins, -

_ such as theft etc., which result in a burning sensation of the heart.
Moreover, he is likely to be punished. But, if a man remains
satisfied and has faith in destiny etc., his heart remains full of
great serenity and bliss, and he also receives the necessities of
life. As unfavourable circumstances, such as loss, death, dishonour
and insult etc., cannot be avoided, they appear though no one, :
has a desire for these. Similarly, favourable circumstances, are
also inevitable. In the Bhagavata, it is mentioned—~ —

""O King, as beings receive pain, as is destined to them, |
having no desire for it, so are pleasures born of sense-contacts, :
received in heaven and hell. Therefore, a wise man, should have
no desire for those pleasures.""

As a man, is destined to receive either wealth or pleasures,

*It is seen that even to a saint, who renounces the world, people offer .
so many gifts. Renunciation, has a singularity that a person, who renounces
wealth and does not attach any importance to it, develops a new destiny to
gain wealth. Saint Ramadasa declares, ""A saint does not possess either food .
or animals or cash but when he takes his seat to have meal, he receives all
the articles of food.”

ft A man will receive whatever wealth he is destined to receive, no
one can be an obstacle to it. So I am _ neither grieved nor surprised, because ,
whatever is ours cannot be of others, (Paficatantra, Mitrasamprapti 112). _ a
"
1925,"Verse 12} SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1873 a
similarly one labours either for righteousness (dharma) or for
salvation (moksa). In righteousness, importance is attached to |
things, such as body and wealth etc., while, in attainment of |
. salvation, there is predominance, of feelings and thoughts. a
A man, should perform his duty in accordance with, the
ordinance of scriptures and social decorum, but he should be
satisfied with its fruit. Lord Krsna declares in the Gita, ""You have
a right to action alone, and never at all, to its fruit"" (2/47). He
is free in performing actions, but he will receive the fruit, which
is destined. How to get rid of fruits, of all the three kinds of :
actions—kniyamana (of the present), saficita (accumulated) and -
prarabdha (destiny). | |
There are two entities—Prakrti (matter or Nature) and purusa |
(Spirit or soul). Prakrti is ever active, while Purusa never undergoes . _
any change, in the form of activity. When man (soul), assumes
his affinity with matter, he becomes a doer, and an enjoyer. But, .
when he renounces his affinity with matter, he gets established. -
in the self, and actions do not affect him, in anyway.
Other points in connection with destiny—{i) A man, is destined _
to come across pleasant and unpleasant circumstances. But they
cannot force him to be sad or happy. He becomes sad or happy,
out of ignorance. A liberated soul remains equanimous, he does
not become, either sad or happy as his ignorance is completely |
gone. Therefore it is said that no Prarabdha remains for a God-
realised soul. (41) A man's intellect, is guided by his destiny. _
Being guided by his intellect, a businessman gains, by buying
a commodity, while another, loses by selling it. Thus gain or
loss, is decided by destiny. But, a man is free to having honest :
or dishonest dealings, because it is 'Kriyamana’ or new action.
(iii) A glass, falls down from a hand and breaks into pieces.
Does it happen out of negligence or by destiny?
A man should be careful in handling it, but he should |
consider it as destined, when it is broken. He should learn
a lesson, in being more careful, in future. Be cautious while 7
"
1926,"1874 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
doing and remain always cheerful in happening. (iv) What is
the difference in a disease, caused. by destiny and disease caused,
by harmful diet? =. :

The disease caused by harmful diet, can be cured by taking -
medicines, but the disease caused by destiny cannot be cured, by
medicines. But religious rites such as. chanting of Mahamrtyuiijaya :
etc., could cure diseases, caused by destiny.

Diseases are of two kinds—Adhi (mental) and Vyadhi
(physical). Mental diseases can again, be divided into two groups
(a) of sadness and worry etc. (b) lunacy. Sadness and worry, :
are caused by ignorance, while lunacy is caused by destiny. 7
Worry and sadness etc., are given up through wisdom, while
lunacy is not abandoned but even during lunacy, a God-realised
man cannot perform any improper action, which is forbidden —
by scriptures. (v) What is the difference between sudden death,
and untimely death?

If a man dies of snake-bite, or by falling from a roof or by 7
drowning, heart failure or by an accident, this 1s sudden death,
which is pre-destined. Such a man, dies after completing the -
duration of his life.

If a man commits suicide, by hanging himself or by jumping
into a well or fire or by lying under a moving train or by poisoning -
himself, this is untimely death. A man commits suicide, without -
completing his span of life. He who commits suicide, incurs the
sin of murder, and this is a new sin. God has bestowed upon us,
this human body so that we may realize Him, so it is a deadly
sin, if we destroy it by committing suicide. : |

Sometimes a person, who makes an effort to commit suicide,
does not die. The reason is, that his destiny is connected with,
the destiny of others. As birth of a would-be-son or good which
is likely to be done by him, to the people or any unfavourable
or favourable fruit, which is going to be reaped by him, because |
of his past actions, may save him from dying. (vi) The person
who is murdered, dies as a fruit of his past actions, while the ;
"
1927,"Verse 13] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1877

uses the term 'Srnu' (Hear) (18/4,19,29,36,45,64). It means that -
a striver, should learn or understand the Sankhya doctrine well.

If he understands it well, he realizes the self, immediately.

'Sankhye krtante proktani siddhaye sarvakarmanam'—These |
five factors are contributory to the performance of all actions,
whether prescribed or prohibited, physical or mental or oral,
and whether these are gross, or subtle. When a person regards °
himself as a doer of actions, he performs actions, and those
actions being accumulated, bear fruit for him. But when he
renounces doership, those actions are performed, but they do :
not bear fruit for him i.e., they do not lead him, to sin, virtue |
or bondage. Then only four factors remain, by which, all actions
are accomplished. These are—l. the seat of action (body), :
2. the organs (senses), 3. efforts and 4. destiny (Gita 18/14).

In the Sankhya doctrine, there is predominance of knowledge -
or discrimination. Then, why has the Lord started the topic of |
accomplishment of actions? The reason is, that Arjuna belongs
to the warrior class and it is his duty to fight. So Lord Krsna, ~
exhorts Arjuna to fight, being unattached to it, either through
Sankhyayoga or Karmayoga. Arjuna, wants to know the true -
nature of Sankhyayoga. So Lord Krsna, begins the topic of action -
through Sankhya doctrine.

Arjuna, wanted to abandon actions. So Lord Krsna clarifies _
that neither performance of action, nor abandonment, leads to ne
salvation. But, when a man (the soul), renounces his affinity with
the perishable Prakrti, he attains salvation. That can be renounced,
either through Karmayoga (the Discipline of Action), or through
Sankhyayoga (the Discipline of Knowledge). In Karmayoga, there
is predominance of renouncement of fruit viz., mineness and :
attachment, while in the Sankhyayoga, there is predominance of
renouncement of egoism. But, if a man renounces attachment,
his egoism is naturally renounced* and if he renounces egoism,

* A man (the soul) being a fragment of God has identity with Him. But .
having disinclinations for Him he has the sense of egoism as ""I am worldly,

{ am intelligent, I am learned” etc. He is attached to this egoism. But if he .
"

The original base of action (body), the doer (agent), the

Comment:— -

‘Adhisthanam'—This term stands for both the body and the
country (earth's surface), in which this body stays.

'Karta'—All actions, are performed by prakrti, not by the -
self. But, when a man by ignorance, regards actions as his own, —
performs all actions by thinking, ""Nothing.is mine, I need nothing and I have
to do nothing for me,” his attachment is renounced. As soon as his attachment
is renounced, his egoism will also be renounced.

A Karmayogi performs all the actions with his physical, subtle and causal
bodies for the welfare of others. With his physical body he works for the
welfare of other, with his subtle body he thinks for the welfare of others and
with his causal body, his trance is for the welfare of others. By doing so his
egoism and attachment are renounced .and he attains peace.

The peace which is attained after renouncing the world is a means (Gita
6/3) while the peace which one attains by God-realization is the supreme (Gita

. 6/15). So if a striver does not enjoy the peace which is a means, he attains
to the supreme peace. |
"
1929,"Verse 14] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1879
he becomes a doer or an agent.* Such a doer, is contributory
to the accomplishment of actions. 7

-'Karanam ca prthagvidham'—There are thirteen instruments meres
(senses)—the hand, the foot, the mouth (organ of voice), anus :
and genital organ—these five organs of actions and ear, eye,
skin, tongue and nose—these five sense-organs—these ten are .
external instruments or senses, while mind, intellect and egoism, .
are internal instruments.

'Vividhasca prthakeesta'—Various kinds of efforts, are
made by above-mentioned, thirteen senses, as hands are used
for exchange of things, feet for moving, the organ of voice -
for speaking, anus for discharging excrement, genital organ for |
discharging urine, ear for hearing, eye for seeing, skin for touch,
tongue for taste, nose for smell, mind for thought, intellect for -
determination and egoism, for pride. |

‘Daivam caivatra paficamam'—The fifth factor, for the /
accomplishment of all actions, is 'Daiva’. Here the term 'Daiva' -
stands for samnskara (Impressions). If a person performs, good
actions, they leave good impressions, but if he performs bad or :
evil actions, their impression 1s bad. Those impressions instigate :
him to act. Good impressions, inspire him to perform good actions
while evil impressions instigate him to perform, evil actions. .

These five factors—body, the doer, instrument, efforts and _
Daiva or impressions, are contributory to the accomplishment

* All the actions are performed by Prakrti, it has been described in the
Gita in several ways—

(1) All actions are performed by the modes of nature (3/27; 13/29). |

(2) The modes are acting on the modes (3/28) and when the seer perceives .
no agent other than the modes (14/19).

(3) The senses act on sense-objects (5/9).

(4) Here in 18/14 five factors are contributory to the accomplishment
of actions.

All these statements mean that actions are performed by nature only and
not by the self, but a man by identifying himself with nature assumes that
he is a doer (3/27). But a wise man realizes that all actions are performed by
nature, so he does nothing at all (5/8).

of all actions. No action can be performed, without the body,
which is the base. Without a doer, who will perform actions?
Actions can be performed by a doer, with the help of senses,  -
only. There cannot be accomplishment of actions, without efforts.

his mind and heart. | - a

Comment: — : |
'‘Sariravanmanobhiryatkarma prarabhate narah nyadyyath va
viparitam va paiicaite tasya hetavah'—The five factors described
in the preceding verse, have been included in this verse also—as
the body stands for 'Adhisthana,’ speech for external instrument
(sense), mind for internal instrument (sense), 'Narah' (Man) for
the doer and the term 'Prarabhate' (Performs), stands for efforts.
As far as 'Daiva' (Impression), is concerned, it also abides in
the internal sense, but it is not revealed. It is revealed, through
"
1931,"Verse 15] | SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1881 |
inclination and action, which are performed by inclinations..

Whatever actions a man performs, with the predominance
of either, the body or the speech or the mind, whether it is Se.
prescribed or prohibited by the scriptures, these five (mentioned |
in the preceding verse), are its causal factors.

All actions are performed, with body, speech and mind. If .
they are prohibited, they lead to bondage. So, in the fourteenth, | |
fifteenth and sixteenth verses of the seventeenth chapter, there is
description of penances of body, speech and mind, respectively. It
means, that if any action is not performed against the scriptures,
with body or speech or mind, it becomes a penance. In the
seventeenth verse of the seventeenth chapter, it is mentioned |
that penance which is practised, without expectation of reward,
is called sattvika. Sattvika penance, leads to emancipation, while _
the rajasika and tamasika penances, lead to bondage. |

The body, speech and mind, become impure, when a man
regards these, as his own. By regarding them as his own, he -
cannot realize, that he has no connection with actions. So if a
striver, does not regard these as his own and does not perform -
any action for himself, these are quickly purified. Therefore, one :
should renounce his affinity, with them, either by purifying them,
through the Discipline of Action or by applying discrimination, :
through the Discipline of Knowledge. As soon as, this assumed a
affinity is renounced, he realizes the self.

All the activities in the world are performed by universal
divine power, so is the case with the activities of an individual.

But he commits an error by disregarding his discriminating power
that he regards himself as doer of actions, such as_ eating,
drinking, sitting, standing, sleeping and waking etc. So these
actions bind him. But if he does not assume, that he is a doer,
those actions do not bear fruit for him, and he is not bound
by them. As actions, such as growth from childhood to youth,
breathing, digestion etc., are performed, by prakrti and if he does
not consider himself as doer, they do not bear virtuous or sinful
"
1932,"1882 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter18
fruits, for him. Similarly, when he has no sense of doership, he
realizes that all actions are performed by nature, alone.

sorrow etc., in the mind is mental action.
‘Nyayyam’—This term means—‘S&ttvika karma’, (actions
of the nature of goodness), actions ordained by the scripture _-
and virtuous actions. ‘viparitam’—this term means—Rajasa- __
Tamasa Karma (actions), actions prohibited by scriptures or
evil (bad) actions. The expression ‘nyayyarh va viparitarn va’

Link:—Having explained the five factors, which are |
contributory to the accomplishment of all actions, according
to the Sankhya doctrine, the Lord, now criticizes, those, who

Comment:— |
'Tatraivam sati kartaramatmanam kevalam tu yah
pasyatyakrtabuddhitvanna sa paSyati durmatih'—All actions are
performed by body, the doer, the instrument, efforts and Daiva,
not by the self. But, he who looks upon his self, as doer, his
understanding is untrained i.e., he has not attached importance,
to discrimination by which he can realize, that the sentient self
is different, from the insentient nature. He is of a perverse mind,
because he has not developed his understanding. If he awakens
his discrimination, he cannot remain, of perverse mind.
"
1933,"Verse 16] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1883
The two terms 'Akrtabuddhitvat', and 'Durmatih’, seemingly -
having the same meaning, have some difference. The former
term, denotes the cause, why a doer is ‘Durmati'. (of perverse
understanding), while the term 'Durmatih’, is adjective for the eee
doer. The doer, is of perverse understanding, because he has :
not developed and refined his discriminative faculty. Had he
developed it, he could not have been called, a man of perverse .
understanding. :
The self, does nothing (Gita 13/31). But when man identifies
himself, with body, because of his perverse mind, he does not
realize, that he is not a doer. | |
The term 'Kevalam’, (merely or only), has been used, both
in the Disciplines of Action, as well as of Knowledge. In the
Discipline of Action, all actions are performed, merely with body,
senses, mind and intellect, and the striver, is not attached to _
those actions (Gita 5/11). So, he realizes that all of them have
their identity with the world. By realizing this fact he realizes,
that he is established, in the self. | -
In the Sankhya doctrine (Discipline of Knowledge), there is
predominance of knowledge or discrimination. Such a striver, -
realizes that all actions are accomplished by these five factors, :
not by the self. But, a person whose mind is deluded by egoism,
considers himself to be a doer. When his delusion is renounced, .
he realizes, that he (the self) is not the doer, at all. So the term a
‘alone’, has been used with the self.
Here, a point needs special attention. In the Discipline of
Action, the term 'Kevalam', has been used with the body, mind
and intellect, to denote that all of these including ego, will be
used for service of the universe, and then the self, will remain
as it is. But in the Discipline of Knowledge the term 'Kevalam'’,
has been used with the self, which denotes that it is absolutely
pure, immutable, enlightened and unattached. But, in this case
there remains egoism, in its subtle form, and after sometime, it
melts and merges in nature.
"
1934,"1884 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter18

Appendix—Of all the ‘cases’ the nominative case is important. ~
In ‘karta’ (nominative) a glimpse of the sentient is perceived
which is not perceived in other ‘cases’. In fact ‘karta’ (the
doer) is not the name of the sentient. It is merely assumed - ~
one ‘ahankara vimudhatma kartahamiti manyate’ (Gita 3/27).
Therefore the Lord has condemned the person, who looks upon
the pure Self as the doer by stating, that his mind is not pure _ -
and he is a man of perverse understanding. The reason is that
the Self is neither a doer nor an experiencer viz., the Self neither
acts nor is tainted—‘Sarirastho’p1 kaunteya na karoti na lipyate’
(Gita 13/31). In fact senses of doership and enjoyership have no
existence, so they can be renounced. ‘I am a doer’ and ‘Iam _ -
an experiencer’—these assumptions are neither God-made nor
nature-made but they are Self-made.

In fact no one is a doer, neither the sentient (the Self) is = _
a doer nor the insentient (non-Self) is a doer. However if we
have to assume a doer, only the non-Self is a doer. This fact _
has been pointed out in the Gita in different ways—All actions -
are performed by ‘prakrti’ viz., “prakrti’ is the doer (Gita 13/29);
all actions are performed by the modes; it is the modes which __
are acting on the modes viz., modes are the doer (Gita 3/27- 7
28, 14/23); senses are moving among the sense-objects viz.,
senses are the doer (Gita 5/9). It means that the doership is in
‘prakrti’ rather than in the Self. Therefore an enlightened exalted “
soul, who remains established in the Self, realizes that he does ©
nothing—“‘naiva kificit karomiti yukto manyeta tattvavit’ (Gita
5/8). The Lord also declares “When a man beholds no other doer
than the modes viz., he realizes this fact in all actions there is |
no doer other than the modes, and knows the Self to be totally
disconnected with the modes, which is the reality, then he attains
to My Being” (Gita 14/9).

A striver on reflection and reasoning can easily accept the
worldly actions such as eating, drinking, sleeping and waking etc.,
to be done by ‘prakrti’; but he thinks that chanting the Lord’s
holy names, meditation, trance and such other spiritual activities |
"
1935,"Verse 16] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1885
are done by himself—this in fact is the stumbling block to a -
striver. The reason is that from the viewpoint of Jnanayoga, an
action may be of the highest standard or of the lowest standard,
it is of the same class and ts done by ‘prakrti’ only. ‘Brandishing a
a lath’ (a long stick) and ‘counting the beads of a rosary’ are
two different activities yet they are in ‘prakrti’ only. It means
that all worldly actions such as eating, drinking, sleeping, waking .
and also the spiritual actions such as chanting the Lord’s holy
name, meditation and trance etc., take place in “prakrti’ only the
performance of an action 1s not possible without being connected
with ‘prakrti’. Therefore a striver should not renounce the spiritual :
actions but he should not have the sense of doership viz., he -
should not regard them to be done by himself and for himself.
If importance is attached to an action whether mundane or
spiritual, it means that importance has been attached to matter -
(non-Self). If spiritual actions, sanctioned by the scriptures, are
given importance, it means that the non-Self is valued which is ""
an obstacle to a striver’s spiritual progress.* Spiritual actions _
aim at God-realization, so they lead to salvation. The more an
action is given the secondary importance, the more predominant
importance will be attached to the affinity with God, and the .
more benefit a striver will derive. If there is predominance of a
mundane action, then in spite of practising the spiritual discipline
for years together, a striver will not get much spiritual benefit. -
Therefore a striver instead of attaching importance to action, should re
love God. Love, rather than action, is the real worship to God.
He whose intellect is devoid of discrimination viz., who has not
attached importance to his discriminative faculty is ‘durmati’ (of
perverse understanding). For Self-realization, discrimination, rather |
*In the worship to God there is predominance of God’s grace; therefore
a striver has no sense of doership. A Kriya (which occurs), an action, the —
worship and the discrimination—these four are different from each other. In
“Kriya’ there is no connection with anyone. In action a person is connected
with favourable and unfavourable circumstances (fruit). In worship he is
connected with God. In discrimination there ts breach of affinity of the Self
with the non-Self.
"
1936,"1886 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter18
than intellect, is the factor. Intellect is purified by discrimination.
In the purification of intellect, virtuous actions are also helpful to
some extent, but it is not purified with virtuous actions as much a
as it is purified by the discriminative faculty. Sins, volatility of  —
mind and ignorance in a striver are not to be blamed so much ©
as the striver is to be blamed, if he does not attach importance
to discrimination. Discrimination is beginningless and eternal. _-
Therefore in spite of the persistence of sin, volatility of mind and ©
ignorance, discrimination can be aroused. Discrimination is not
destroyed by sin but it is not aroused. A striver does not attach __
: importance to discrimination because he attaches importance to
actions and objects. He who attaches importance to actions and
objects is a man of perverse understanding. .

Comment:—
""Yasya nahankrto bhavo buddhiryasya na lipyate'—He is free |
from the egoistic notion that 'I am a doer and his intellect is
not tainted, by the selfishness that I shall reap the fruit. As all
actions, are performed in light but light is not the doer, similarly
the self, is merely a silent witness, of all activities. Thus a striver,
realizes that he is not a doer. Similarly, he has no desire of his
own i.e., he is free from the pairs of opposites, that it should so |
"
1937,"Verse 17] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1887 .
happen and it should not so happen, it means, that his intellect ”
is not tainted. Such a striver, remains neither a doer, nor an
enjoyer, and he realizes, this fact.
_ Nature does everything and it always undergoes modifications, |
while the self, is its illuminator. By knowing this fact, a striver,
remains established, 1n the self. He does not regard himself, as
a doer. When he is free from this egoistic notion, his intellect -
is not tainted, to acquire the fruit of actions.
Egoism is an assumption, and this assumption, is made. by
an embodied soul, himself. It is he (himself), who assumes a -
sense of doership or denies, this sense.
‘Hatvapi sa imallokanna hanti na nibadhyate'—Though, he
may slay all beings at once, yet he does not really kill, because :
he has no egoistic notion; and he is not bound, because he has
no notion of enjoyership. It means, that he is attached neither to -
action nor to their fruit. Action and fruits, are within the sphere -
of Nature. But, due to not realizing this fact, an embodied soul, -
assumes doership and enjoyership, in himself. When action is
performed with a sense of doership, then the three factors,
namely, the doer, the organ and the activity, are contributory -
to the accomplishment of an action. In the absence of doership,
all actions are converted into inaction. But, with a sense of
doership, any activity, converts into an action. When the sense :
of doership is extinct, then the cosmic soul (God), Who is the —
essence and illuminator of all, remains. So, he can neither kill,
nor be bound (Gita 2/19).
He slays all beings—what does it mean? It means that
a man who performs his duty, according to his caste (social |
order) and stage of life, being free from egoistic notion, with
his untainted intellect, incurs no sin. For example, a liberated
soul belonging to warrior class, while slaying warriors on the
battlefield, neither slays nor is he bound, because he is free
from egoism, and selfishness.
Here, the context 1s of war. So, by using the term |
"
1938,"1888 _ §SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter18

‘Hatvapi ' (even having slain), the Lord inspires Arjuna, to wage the

war. The term 'Api' (even) denotes—""Such a man, does nothing at

all, though he may be ever-engaged in action"" (Gita 4/20), ""Being _ .
engaged in all forms of activities, he dwells in the Lord"" (Gita __

6/31), ""The Supreme self, though dwells in the body, it neither

acts nor is tainted"" (Gita 13/31). It means, that the Self, remains

uniform and fixed, whether a man is engaged in actions, orhe does

not act. The reason is, that it is nature, which performs all actions.

A man (soul), has his identity with God, but it is because
of his egoistic notion, that he becomes separate, from the Lord.
Actually, he is neither a doer nor an enjoyer, but by identifying
himself with a body he accepts an egoistic notion, and thus
becomes a doer and an enjoyer. |

This egoism is of two kinds. 'Aharhsphirti'’, and 'Ahankrti’. A
man, awakes from sound sleep and he realizes that he exists. This
is one kind of egoism, which is called 'Aharhsphirti’. But then by
identifying himself with the body, he assumes that he belongs to __
a particular caste, creed and social order etc., this is his affinity
with, the unreal. With such affinity (identification), with the unreal
(body), he regards actions done by the body, as actions done, -
by the self. This is another kind of egoism, called 'Ahankrti’.

There is limitedness, in the self due to ego. Even in
‘Ahamsphurti’, as mentioned above, individualism remains. But |
it does not bind. When one accepts 'Ahankrtt', viz., he assumes
relationship with someone or something or some action, then
dualism of virtue and vice arises in the embodied soul, which
induces him to perform good and bad actions. On Self-realization,
the limitedness in 'Aharhsphirti', is destroyed. In such a state,
actions are done by that liberated soul, in an impersonal state.
These do not bind him.

''Na hanti na nibadhyate'—He neither.slays, nor is he bound—
What does it mean? There are two states of trance temporary and
permanent. The temporary state is called ‘Nirvikalpa-Avastha’,
while the permanent one, is called 'Nirvikalpa-Bodha. The former —_-
"
1939,"Verse 17] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1889
does not remain uniform, it undergoes change. It can be attained ;
- through practice. By remaining detached, from the 'Nirvikalpa- ,
Avastha’, the self-evident 'Nirvikalpa-Bodha, is realized. The latter _
remains ever uniform without undergoing any change, and it |
cannot be attained, through practice. In this state, while slaying
all beings, a man neither slays, nor is bound by such killing.
_ How should a man be free, from the egoistic notion and
how should his intellect not be tainted?
A man, by applying his discrimination, should realize the
fact, that all actions are performed by nature alone, which always -
undergoes modifications. Moreover, all actions, as well as their
fruit, appear and disappear, while the self, as illuminator of all
of them, ever remains uniform. By realizing this fact, he can be
free from egoistic notion, and his intellect, is not tainted.
Appendix—The expressions—‘nahankrta bhava’ means to -
be free from egoism and ‘buddhih na lipyate’ means to be free
from desire, the sense of mine and selfishness. .
Arjuna said, “Sin will accrue to.us by slaying these desp-
eradoes—‘papamevasrayedasmanhatvaitanatatayinah’ (Gita 1/36) ;
and ‘We’ll accrue sin by slaying these reverend preceptors
and elders—‘gurinahatva hi mahanubhavan............’ (Gita 2/5).
Therefore here the Lord declares that Arjuna will accrue no sin
even though he slays not only his reverend preceptors and elders 7
but also all other creatures because sin will accrue only, if he has ee
the egoistic notion, and if his intellect 1s tainted. The intellect is :
tainted by having desire, the sense of mine and selfishness. If a
man is drowned in the Ganges, the Ganges accrues no sin; and
if anyone drinks its water, bathes in it and imgates his land and
makes it fertile, the Ganges does not earn any virtue. When it
rains heavily, several creatures are killed and the life of several
other creatures is saved but rain neither accrues sin nor virtue.
The reason is that they have neither the egoistic notion nor their
intellect is tainted. If a Surgeon performs a surgical operation,
being free from desire, the sense of mine and selfishness, in |
"
1940,"1890 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter18  -
spite of cutting the organs, he incurs no sin. If he is also free
from the egoistic notion also, then no question arises at all of
his accruing sin. | Se
By Jnanayoga, the egoistic notion is destroyed; and by
Karmayoga, the taintedness of the intellect is wiped out. If one
of the two is destroyed, the other is also destroyed. It is because
of the egoistic notion that in a man (self), the desire for pleasure
and salvation evolves. When the egoistic notion is wiped out,
then the desire for pleasure is also wiped out—‘buddhiryasya
na lipyate’. With the destruction of the desire for pleasure, the
yearning for salvation is automatically fulfilled because salvation
is axiomatic (Self-evident). |
PISSED .
Link:—Knowledge and actions in themselves, are not evils. -
It is the sense of doership, which is an evil. A sense of doership,
causes actions—this is explained in the verse, that follows:—

Ut wd dla Bfaer: HAASTE: UV I
jhanam jiieyam parijnata trividha karmacodana
karanam karma karteti trividhah karmasangrahah
Knowledge, the knowable and the knower, these three motivate __

three constituents (bases) of action. 18
Comment:— |
{In the fourteenth verse of this chapter, the Lord explained
the body, doer, instruments, efforts and daiva (impressions),
these five factors, as responsible for the accomplishment of
all actions. Out of these, the most important one, is the doer.
So the Lord vehemently criticized, a man, who looks upon his
self, as doer, in the sixteenth verse, while He praised one who
is free from egoistic notion, in the seventeenth verse. The Lord
in the eighteenth verse, clarifies that it is the notion of egoism —_-
"
1941,"Verse 18] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1891 -
(doership), which binds a man. The main purpose of this verse
is a man should get rid of the notion of doership.]

'Jiianarh jiieyam parijiiata trividha karmacodana'— Knowledge, re
the knowable, and the knower, are the threefold incitement to
action. Knowledge has been mentioned first of all, because it
is knowledge, which motivates a man to action. As a man first
knows, that he 1s thirsty—this is knowledge; and then how :
he should quench it. It is water, which can quench the thirst.

So water is ‘knowable', He who knows, is the knower. But all

the three—knowledge, the knowable and the knower, together °
motivate a man to action. If there is absence of anyone of the :
three, the remaining two cannot contribute, to action. .

He who knows the motivation of action, is called 'Parijnata’

(knower only). In this 'Parijnata’ a sense of doership and sense _
of getting anything for himself, are quite absent. He knows only

inspiration (sphurana), of actions. There can be motivation to |
do an act, only in a particular individual. In respect of different -
activities, such as eating, drinking, sleeping, hearing etc., the

doer of these different activities, can be designated as eater, -
drinker, sleeper, hearer etc. But the knower of all of these, will
be designated by the term 'Panjnata.’

‘Karanam karma karteti trividhah karmasangrahah'—The
instrument, activity and the agent, are the triple constituents a
of action. It is the conjunction of these three, which produces
action. The means, such as mind, intellect and senses etc., by
which he performs actions, are known 'Karana’ (Instruments).

The acts of eating, drinking, sitting, walking, coming and going
etc., are ‘Karma’ (activities). A person, who having affinity with
instruments and activities, performs actions, is called a ‘Karta’
(doer). These three, are the constituents of action. Here, the
Lord wants to emphasize the fact, that it is a sense of doership,
which binds a man. Out of the three constituents of action, the
Organ (instrument) does not contribute to the accomplishment of
action, as it is subservient to a doer. Only that activity, which |

doership, which is the chief contributory factor, to action. Inthe
absence of a sense of doership, no action is accomplished. The
terms 'Karana', and 'Karma’, have been used before, while the
term 'Karta' has been used close to the term ‘Karma sangrahah'’,  -
by the Lord, in order to bring home the fact, that it is a sense
of doership which gets a man into bondage. If he performs
action without a notion of doership, he is not bound because  .
no action is at all accomplished in the absence of the sense of
doership. So the Lord has used the term 'Karta' (doer), close to
-  expression'Karma-sangrahah' (constituents of action).
| _ Appendix—Arjuna expressed his desire to know the
truth about the path of knowledge and the path of action —
(Gita 18/1), therefore the Lord described the path of action
upto the twelfth verse. Then the Lord from the viewpoint of the
path of knowledge, while describing actions, mentioned five _
factors which are contributory to the accomplishment of all
actions (Gita 18/13—-15). The same fact in a different manner -
is described here in the form of ‘Karmaprerana’ (incitement to
action) and ‘Karmasangrahah’ (constituents of action). |

carefully also. 19

Comment:— .
'Procyate gunasankhyane'—The Lord explains to Arjuna, the °

three kinds of knowledge, action and agent, as declared in the

science of modes (Sankhya philosophy), according to differences 7

in the modes.

‘Jiiinam karma ca karta ca tridhaiva gunabhedatah'—In the
preceding verse, the Lord explained the threefold incitement,

to action and the threefold constituents, of action. Thus he _

explained six factors.* Out of these the Lord, first discusses

three—knowledge from the threefold incitement, while action

and agent, from the threefold constituents. Any person, begins ,

an action after possessing knowledge, about it. So knowledge,

has been taken first. In the performance of an action, an agent

occupies an important place, but action has also been taken with .

it, because without action, he cannot accomplish (execute), an rs

action. It means, that knowledge occupies an important place,

as an incentive to action, while action and agent, are significant,

so far as the execution of action is concerned. If these three,

are Sattvika (good), a man is not bound. If these are rajasika |

(passionate) or tamasika (ignorant), a man is bound.

Now the question arises as to why the knowable and the
knower, have not been taken from the threefold incitement. The

* Knowledge, the knowable and the knower—the threefold incitement is
subtle material while the instrument, the action and the agent—the threefold
constituents of action are gross materials. .
"
1944,"1894 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 :
reason 1s, that a knower becomes an agent, when he establishes |
his affinity, with an action. So, within the three kinds of agents,
three kinds of knowers, are included. Moreover, a knower is of Se
three kinds, only when he is attached to modes of nature. If he |
is not attached to them, he remains merely, a knower, without
having a classification of three kinds. :
The knowable or the object, to be known is 'Jiieya’. There are
different objects to be known, but the aim of knowing these objects,
is to derive happiness. So the Lord, has classified the knowable,
by the name of happiness into three kinds, further (in 18/36—39). -
_ Similarly the Lord, has not classified the instruments, such
as senses and mind etc., into three kinds. Whatever actions, are
performed with senses etc.,.a man performs these by applying
his intellect. So the Lord, classifies the instruments by the name
of intellect, further (in 18/30—32). ~
Firmness (steadiness) is necessary, with intellect, in the
Discipline of Knowledge. So the Lord, in the Discipline of _
Knowledge, has used firmness with intellect (6/25, 18/51). He.
has also classified it into three kinds (18/33—35). _
The term ‘Tridhaiva’, denotes that there are only three kinds, .
neither more nor less than the three, because the three modes
of goodness (sattva), passion (rajas) and ignorance (tamas) are
born of nature (Gita 14/5). So because of connection with these -
three modes they are of three kinds. OO
""Yathavat'—As it has been described in the branch of
knowledge, dealing with Gunas, He is telling him the same, |
without any addition or substraction.
'Srnu'—Lord Krsna asks Arjuna, to hear the topic attentively, -
because out of the three the sattvika one, enables a man to realize
God, by breaking up his affinity with actions, while the rajasika
leads to the bondage of birth and death, and the tamasika is
conducive to degradation, viz., hell and eighty-four lac forms,
of lives. So he should adopt the sattvika mode and abandon the
Rajasika and Tamasika. |
"
1945,"Verse 20] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1895 -
'Tani'—The agent, action and knowledge, have no connection
with the self. The self is ever-pure and detached.
‘Api'—It is indispensable to know, these three kinds, because Toe
by knowing these in the right perspective, a man can realize 7
the fact enumerated in (18/17). 'He who is free from egoistic
notions, whose intellect is not tainted, though he slays the -
people, he really slays not, nor is he bound (by actions)’ Le.,
he realizes, the self. |

beings), knows such knowledge to be sattvika. 20
Comment:— |
'Sarvabhitesu yenaikam bhavamavyayamiksate avibhaktam :
vibhaktesu'—All beings and things etc., are kaleidoscopic, they a
have no existence of their own. But they seem to exist, in the
light of the Imperishable Lord, Who pervades everywhere. A
man, out of ignorance sees their existence. As soon as his ignorance
is removed, and he gains knowledge, he realizes the existence
of God, in all the perishable beings, and things etc.
Having gained knowledge a striver; sees the imperishable
Supreme Lord, abiding equally in all perishable beings (Gita
13/27). Though He is undivided, yet He seems to be divided
among beings, things, circumstances and incidents etc., (Gita
13/16). A striver, beholds only imperishable essence, in all the
objects, whichever undergo changes. How to know that, he sees 7
"
1946,"1896 | SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 :
only the Lord? He remains free, from attachment and aversion.
This is the criterion. , |

'Tajjiianamn viddhi sattvikam'—This knowledge, is known oe
to be sattvika. It is called Sattvika, because of affinity with |
things and inclinations etc. If this affinity, is renounced,
this knowledge is Self-realization, which ought to be known, :
as stated by Lord Krsna. He declares, ""I will describe, that
which ought to be known and knowing which, one attains

immortality” (Gita 13/12). a |

The universe, is known by senses, the senses are known by 7
intellect, and intellect is known by TT’. The universe, the senses
and the intellect, are known by T’. But there is one Illuminator, -
Who illuminates this 'T' also. That Illuminator is all-pervasive and |
infinite, while 'T' is limited and finite. 'You' (thou), 'this’ and
‘ that’, are also illumined in that light, as 'T' is illumined. That -
[iluminator, is not subject to illumination. That is Dlumination-
Incarnate. He is attributeless, the Absolute. He is undivided and _
He illuminates, everything. His illumination in a particular person,
is called sattvika knowledge.

In other words, Sattvika knowledge, can be explained, in ;

this way. All the beings, are included in 'T’,, 'you’, 'this' and ‘that’. Ra
They are diverse, but He who illumines them, is indivisible. They
ever undergo changes. and are not real, but He ever remains
uniform. All the four, T', 'you', ‘this', and 'that', are not really ,
existent, in that [IJuminator. But they get their seeming existence,
by that Illuminator only. That Illuminator, illumines all and He .
Himself is an embodiment of illumination. They are separate
(divided), while He as their Uluminator, remains undivided.
This is sattvika knowledge. Being pure and illuminating, this
knowledge, illumines all divisible, changeable and perishable
beings, and objects (Gita 14/6).

This sattvika knowledge is said to be the illuminator from
"
1947,"Verse 21] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1897 .
the point of view of the illumined and indivisible from the point :
of view of the divisible. But when it has no connection with the
illumined and divisible objects, it is in fact attributeless, absolute 7 |
and real knowledge itself.
_ Appendix—As a common man holds that the Self pervades
the entire body, similarly a striver holds that God pervades the
entire universe. As the body and the world are one (identical),
so are the Self and God one. |
From the view-point of a striver, beings also, have their own
existence, so his knowledge is ‘Sattvika’. If from his view-point -
there is no separate existence of beings but there is only one :
imperishable existence, then it is the transcendental entity viz.,
Self-realization (attainment of Brahma). That imperishable entity :
pervades equally everywhere. We have our natural identity with
that entity. a -

*The term Tu’ has been used to denote that the Rajasika knowledge is
different from the Sattvika one.

1948,"1898 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
It is because of this passionate knowledge, that a man sees |
diversity in different persons, gods, devils, demons, birds,
beasts, moths, insects, trees and plants etc., according to their So |

perception of unity, and does not see the Imperishable Supreme

that knowledge, is rajasika. A man, possessing rajasika knowledge

is successful, mighty and happy and there is none else like him.
He is entangled, in the meshes of delusion (16/15). -

'Ahaitukam'—His knowledge, is irrational and it is against the
scriptures. He does not realize, that he (the soul), is imperishable
and uniform, while a body is kaleidoscopic and perishable. He
identifies the soul, with the body. :

'Atattvarthavadalpam ca'—Such a person, does not know the
truth, that the soul is different from the body. His knowledge, is
very poor and insignificant. So the Lord, has not used the term -
‘Knowledge’, in this verse. A tamasika person lacks knowledge, Ss""
he is ignorant. So the Lord instead of using the term 'Knowledge’
has used the terms 'Yat’ (which) and 'Tat' (that) only. |

‘Tattamasamudahrtam'—That understanding which is without i
reason, without foundation in truth, and is_ trivial, is declared
to be tamasika. |

If Tamasika knowledge, is not knowledge at all, and the ~
Lord hesitates in calling it so, why has it been described? The
reason is, that the Lord in the nineteenth verse of this chapter, 7
asked Arjuna to hear three kinds of knowledge, action and agent.
So after describing the sattvika and rajasika knowledge, it was
necessary for Him to describe it also as such.

Appendix—In Tamasa knowledge, demoniac nature 1s Ke ae
predominant. In this verse the term ‘Jnana’ has not been given
which means that in fact it is no knowledge at all, it is mere
ignorance. It is the intellect of Tamasa people which has been
called ‘pasu buddhi’ (beastly intellect)— |

according to a person's caste, (social order), stage of life (ASrama)
and circumstances, are ‘Niyata’. 7
Here the term 'Niyatam' denotes, that the actions mentioned
above, are to be performed, but actions that are prohibited by |
scriptures should not be performed. :
Here, the expression 'Sangarahitam’, denotes freedom, from a or
sense of doership. As trees, have no sense of doership when new
leaves sprout, and when they blossom, similarly in the bodies
different activities, such as digestion, development and decay
etc., take place, naturally. So by realizing this fact a striver,
becomes free from doership. Here, the expression 'Sangarahitam’
denotes, freedom from doership, because freedom from attachment,
has been mentioned by the term ‘Aragadvesatah' in this verse.
Moreover in Sankhyayoga* it is absence of the sense of doership
*Here in 'Sankhyayoga’ the expression ‘Sangarahitam' denotes freedom
from doership while in ‘'Karmayoga’ the expression ‘Sangam tyaktva phalam

1951,"Verse 24] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1901 7
which is more important. ""
The expression ‘Aragadvesatah krtam’ means, that an action
should be performed, being free from attachment and aversion _ a
viz., an action should neither be performed with attachment /
nor renounced, with aversion. Moreover, there should not be
attachment or aversion for the instruments (body, senses and
mind etc.,) in performing actions. |
The expression 'Aragadvesatah' denotes, freedom: from
attachment at present, while the term'Aphalaprepsuna’ denotes,
freedom of attachment, in future. It means, that an action should -
be performed, without any desire for fruit in future, and there :
should be detachment from action and objects. It has already
been mentioned, that action should be performed, without having :
either attachment or aversion. Now He declares, that it is to be
performed without attachment, in future 1.e., without seeking ~
any reward. Such action, is declared to be sattvika. It is called
Sattvika, so long as, it is connected with. prakrti (nature), in a
very subtle form. When its connection is completely renounced, -
this action becomes inaction or say it has no binding effect.

Comment:— |

""Yattu* kamepsuna karma'—A passionate person, performs - |
action to seek comfort, pleasure, honour and praise etc. : |

'Sahankarena'—He feels boastful of his actions in public,
when people praise him, and in privacy, by thinking that he is
more prompt, sincere and honest in actions, than other people.

Thus action performed with egoistic feeling, is called 'rajas'.

""Va punah'—The expression 'Va punah'’, (or again) has
been used to denote, that action either performed for fruit
(reward), or again by egoism, becomes rajasika. So, if it is :
performed both for fruit. and impelled by egoism, it surely
becomes rajasika.

""Kriyate bahulayasam'— While performing action, a man has -
to make effort and feel strain. But the man, who hankers after
physical comforts, feels greater strain. On the other hand, a man
who hankers after pleasure and prosperity, does not feel much -
strain, because he has a yearning for accumulating wealth and
enjoying pleasure. So instead of physical rest, he has an eye on -
prosperity and pleasure. |

A rajasika person, while performing action in public, does
not feel great strain, because his sense of egoism, is satisfied.
But when he performs action in loneliness, he feels much strain, Somes
because his sense of egoism is not satisfied, and he is ease loving.

'Tadrajasamudahrtam'—Action performed by a person,
longing for fruit with egoism, and with much strain, is declared
to be rajasika. .

needs more things when he does any work, and he has to make

‘Anubandham'—The person who performs an action for its

a tamasika person, undertakes an action without foreseeing its -

'Ksayam'—He does not think of the loss of health, wealth, oo

his duty, without being disturbed by odds, difficulties, obstacles -
and blame etc., while a man endowed with enthusiasm, discharges :
his duty with zeal, equally in success and failure, honour and |
dishonour and in praise and blame etc. Thus a Sattvika doer,
remains endowed with firmness and zeal.
'Siddhyasiddhyornirvikarah'—A Sdttvika doer, remains
unaffected in success and. failure. He neither feels elevated,
when an action is accomplished easily, nor does he feel dejected 7
if it is not accomplished in spite of best efforts. He remains “
equanimous, in success and failure. . Oo : |
‘Karta sattvika ucyate'—Such an agent, who is free. from |
attachment, is non-egoistic, endowed with firmness and zeal, and -
who is unswayed by success and failure, is called sattvika. —
In this verse, there are six characteristics—attachment,
egoism, firmness, zeal, success and failure. A sattvika doer, is -
free from the first two, he is endowed with the middle two and
he remains equanimous, in the last two. -
Appendix—In the Gita equanimity or unaffectedness in success
and failure has been mentioned in three verses—‘siddhyasiddhyoh
samo bhutva’ (2/48), ‘samah siddhavasiddhau ca’ (4/22) and here ;
‘siddhyasiddhyornirvikarah’. It means that success or failure is BO
not under the control of a man but it is within his power to
remain unaffected by success and failure. Whatever is within
his power, that is to be set right.

outwardly that no person can do so well as he can, and does
not regard himself to be superior to others inwardly.

is moved by joy and sorrow—such a doer is said to be, Rajasika
(passionate). 27
Comment:— : 7 .
""Ragi'—The first characteristic of a passionate agent, is passion -
or attachment. A rajasika doer, remains attached to action and -
their fruits, as well as, to persons, things and objects etc.
'Karmaphalaprepsuh'—A rajasika person, performs actions to -
seek their fruit. He offers charity, to gain honour and praise here,
and heavenly pleasures hereafter. Similarly, he takes medicines,
to keep his body fit and healthy. ~
'Lubdhah'—A rajasika person, is not satisfied with his
possessions. He goes on craving for honour, praise, fame, :
wealth, sons, and family etc. The more he receives, the more
he yearns. ° .
_'Hirnsatmakah'—He possesses an oppressive nature. He inflicts — -
suffering on others, for selfish motive. The more pleasure he enjoys, Te
the more pain, he inflicts on those, who suffer want. Enjoyment
of sense-objects, without caring for the miseries of others, is
violence. Without violence, no enjoyment is possible. | |
When the Lord declared, that tamasa action, (18/25) and
tamasa doer—both are oppressive, He meant to explain, that
actions by a tamasa agent, are not performed with discrimination,
because of delusion. So he is oppressive, in his daily life. A rajasa
person, enjoys mundane pleasure, then other people who suffer
from want have a heart-burn to see them, enjoy such pleasures. |
It means, that a tamasa person, does injury to others, through

no one wants to use the clothes, of a person, who was attached ~

of causing injury or suffering to others) has been mentioned,
because Rajoguna and Tamoguna are close to each other, while .
Sattvaguna is far from the two. Rajoguna is of the nature of
passion while Tamoguna is of the nature of delusion. In Rajoguna
a man remains conscious and careful but in Tamoguna he loses |
consciousness and carefulness. A selfish man having attachment oo a
inflicts more sufferings on others than does a deluded man inflict. |
Therefore in Rajoguna there is more violence (injury). A Rajasa
man because of attachment and selfishness becomes oppressive
(violent). He remains engrossed in violence. |

The doer, who is indiscriminate, vulgar, arrogant, obstinate, _

malicious, indolent, despondent and procrastinative, he is said to

be Tamasika (of the mode of ignorance). 28 |

Comment:—

‘Ayuktah'—Tamasa (mode of ignorance), deludes, all embodied :
beings (Gita 14/8). A Tamasika person cannot discriminate,
between the proper and the improper and between, what should
be done and what should be refrained from. -

‘Prakrtah'—Prakrtah or vulgar, is he who has not improved -
his life through good education, scriptures and good company :
etc. He possesses a childish nature, having no sense of duty.

| '‘Stabdhah'—An (arrogant) man, remains unbending with his _
mind, speech and body. He does not bow down to elderly people,
parents, teachers etc. He is hard-hearted by nature, having no
element of gentleness and humility. _ -

'Sathah'—A tamasika person, out of obstinacy does not follow
good advice and good ideas, of other people. He out of delusion, .
holds that his own ideas, are good and he sticks to them.

‘Anaiskrtikah'—A tamasika person, does not return good, for
the good done to him. He rather returns evil for good. Therefore .
he is termed as Anaiskrtikah. So,

‘Alasah'—An indolent man, does not perform his duty. He |
wants to lie down or to sleep or to remain idle.

""Visadi'—Such a despondent man, grieves day and night and
his worries, disquietude, and sadness, know no end. Therefore
all are in him automatic because he has no sense of duty.
_ 'Dirghasiitri'—A procrastinating person, does not think how
to perform action promptly and thoroughly. He takes a lot of
time, in completing the work, which should have been done in
a short time. Moreover, he does not complete it, thoroughly. |

‘Karta tamasa ucyate'—An agent who possesses the above-
"
1959,"Verse 28] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1909 7
mentioned eight characteristics, is said to be tamasika. |
In the twenty-sixth, twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth verses,
the Lord has enumerated the characteristics of agents. As is, an
agent, so are his actions and so are the instruments to perform, |
those actions. So the sattvika, rajasika and tamasika agents, -
perform actions according to their own nature.
A sattvika agent, by making his actions and intellect etc.,
Sattvika, by rejoicing in Sattvika happiness, identifies himself with -
God i.e., reaches the end of sorrow (Gita 18/36). The reason 1s, .
that the aim of a sattvika agent is God-realization. So, being free
from a sense of doership and enjoyership, he identifies himself, -
with God, because actually he had his identity, with Him. A
rajasika or a tamasika doer, cannot identify himself with God, 7
because he is engrossed in rajasika or tamasika pleasure and his
aim is, not God-realization. | -
Now, a doubt arises, that an agent can be sattvika.: But
how are actions Sattvika? The explanation is, that when an
agent performs action without having attachment for it, without -
a sense of doership and without expecting any reward, the action,
becomes Sattvika. Such Sattvika action does good to the doer, as
well as, to the entire universe. It makes persons, things, objects, .
environment to which it is connected, pure (Gita 14/6) as the Be
purity is the characteristic of the mode of Sattva. —
Secondly Patafjali holds Rajoguna (the mode of passion)
only to be of the nature of activity (YogadarSana 2/18) while in
the Gita recognising Rajoguna as activity also it is predominantly -
declared to be of the nature of passion (14/7). In fact it is not
activity but passion (attachment) which binds.
In the Gita actions are declared to be of three kinds—Sattvika,
Rajasika and Tamasika (18/23—25) according to the feelings of
the agent. The actions of Sattvika, Rajasika and Tamasika agents |
are Sattvika, Rajasika and Tamasika respectively. So the Lord
"
1960,"1910 §RIMADBHAGAVADGITA _ [Chapter 18 -

has not considered only an activity to be Rajasika. 7
Appendix—The term ‘visadi’ (gloomy or sad) should

be included in Rajoguna but here it has been mentioned in - |

Tamoguna. The reason is that the Tamasa disposition is contrary |

to discrimination, therefore a Tamasa person is more gloomy,

more grieved than a Rajasa person. ——

Comment:— : ;
[In the eighteenth verse of this chapter, the instrument, action

and agent have been declared, to be the threefold constituents

of action. Out of the instruments, senses are not classified into |

three kinds. Intellect, predominates senses and it guides them. BC

So the Lord, gives the threefold distinction of Buddhi as three

kinds of instrument. It is Dhrti which does not let a man deviate

from his aim. When understanding remains firm to achieve the

aim, it is achieved. So, besides intellect, Dhrti has also been

classified into three kinds.* .
In the context of incitement and constituents of action, for a
* Intellect and firmness play an important role not only in Sankhyayoga

(the Discipline of Knowledge) but in other means of God-realization also.

So in the Gita intellect and firmness have been mentioned together such as

‘Let him gain tranquillity little by little, by means of intellect controlled by |

firmness’ (6/25) and ‘Endowed with a pure intellect, controlling the self by

firmness’ (18/51). :
"
1961,"Verse 29] _ SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1911 :
striver, knowledge, action and agent, play a very important role.
Similarly, in order to follow spiritual discipline and to transcend
the three modes of nature, it is indispensable for one to know =
the three kinds of Buddhi and Dhrti so that he may rise high, :
by cultivating the Sattvika Buddhi and Dhrti, and give up the
rajasika and tamasika ones.] : | .
'‘Dhanaiijaya'—When Pandavas performed a sacrifice (yajiia)
named Rajasiiya, Arjuna, collected fabulous wealth, by gaining
victory over several kings. So Arjuna is called, 'Dhanafijaya’ .
(winner of wealth). Here Lord Krsna explains to Arjuna, that
real wealth, consists in transcending the three modes of nature, :
by cultivating sattvika Buddhi and Dhrti. So he should justify -
his name, by possessing this real wealth,
'Buddherbhedam dhrteScaiva gunatastrividham Srnu'— The -
Lord declares, that though Buddhi is one and Dhrti is also separate,
yet according to predominance of the modes of nature, they
have been classified into three kinds—Sattvika, Rajasika and -
Tamasika. He asks Arjuna, to hear attentively, as He is going
to explain these fully and distinctly to him. -
By using the term 'Caiva’, (and also) the Lord declares, that
he will explain the three distinctions of Buddhi and also of Dhrti.
Though firmness, seems to be a characteristic of intellect, yet .
it is different, as well as important. It is because of firmness, To
that an agent, can make the right use of his understanding. If
firmness is sattvika, a striver's understanding, will remain firm.
So in spiritual discipline, there is not so much need of steadiness
of mind, as steadiness of understanding (intellect). Steadiness of
mind, is required in accomplishments (Siddhis), such as Anima etc.
But, in spiritual progress, it is indispensable for understanding, to
hold firm to aim.* When a striver's, intellect and firmness—both
are sattvika, he will follow spiritual discipline firmly. So, it is
*'By intellect a striver decides his aim and he holds firm to it through |
firmness. If even the vilest sinner firmly follows his aim that he has to realize
God, all his sins perish and he becomes righteous (Gita 9/30). 7

of bondage and liberation—that intellect, is sattvika (of the nature
of goodness), O Partha (Arjuna). 30
Comment:— | :
""Pravrttirn ca nivrttirn ca'—-Sometimes, a striver is engaged
in work, while at another time, he is engaged in adoration and
meditation, by renouncing action. His performance of action and :
adoration or meditation with desire for fruit, is included in work.*

' But, if these are performed without a desire for fruit, both are
included, in renunciation and lead to God-realization. So, while
performing and renouncing an act, a striver, should expect no
reward. If both these are performed, to derive pleasure or joy
out of them, they are included in work, and lead to bondage.

In other words, in both the cases individuality persists, it does
not get lost. But, if these are performed, for the good of others,

* When a person devotes his time in adoration and meditation in solitude, |
he does not possess riches and objects there but he has a subtle desire that he
will be honoured and praised by the people as they will regard him as wise |
because he meditates on God in solitude. -
"
1963,"Verse 30] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1913 -
both are included in renunciation. In both cases individuality gets

lost. So a striver, should follow a path of renunciation, for Self-
realization or follow the path of work (Action), by. serving all
beings, in order to realize God, the illuminator of the two—on :
the path of work and that of renunciation.

'Karyakarye'—Work, which is done according to ordinance |
of scriptures, consistent with one's caste (Varna) and social order |
(Agrama), is what ought to be done, while work which is prohibited
by scriptures, is that which ought not to be done...

Work which is obligatory and is within our power (capacity), ”
and which leads beings to salvation, is called duty, and it ought :
to be done. But work which ought not to be done, and which
leads to bondage, is not included in duty. We need not do the
work, which is beyond our capacity. :

'Bhayabhaye'—A man should think, of the root of fear
and fearlessness. Action, which may cause harm to one's own ©
self, as well as to others, gives birth to fear. But action which -
is performed, for the welfare of all beings, is likely to cause
fearlessness. When a man performs action, which ought not to be -
done, he is full of fear, thinking of dishonour, blame and insult.

But, when a man works according to ordinance of scriptures for
the welfare of all beings, to please God, he remains, fearless.
This fearlessness, leads him to God-realization. ; |

'Bandharn moksarh ca ya vetti'—He, who externally performs,
virtuous action such as sacrifice, charity and pilgrimage etc., but
internally, has a desire for the unreal and perishable objects, and |
heavenly pleasure etc., his actions lead him to bondage. But a
striver, who has an exclusive devotion to God, attains liberation.

A man thinks that he is dependent, because he does not
possess certain things, and he is independent, when those things
are available to him. But in fact, he is dependent in both the cases.

The difference is, that in the former case, the dependence is seen
and felt, while in the latter case, it is not seen because at that |
time, a man loses his sight. But in fact, both mean dependence,
"
1964,"1914 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter18 -
which leads to bondage. The former, is the revealed, bitter poison,
while the latter is hidden, sweet poison. But both are poisons,
which are fatal. - | _
It means, that all worldly desires lead to bondage while
desirelessness, leads to liberation. The need (necessity) for God,
also leads to liberation.* If a man has a desire, it is a bondage,
whether he possesses the things or not. But if he is free from
desire, he is liberated, whether he possesses the things or not.
""Buddhih sa partha sattviki—Thus, intellect which knows
reality about the path of work and renunciation, what ought to -
be done and what ought not to be done, fear and fearlessness, -
bondage and liberation—that intellect is sattvika. What is reality?
Reality is that, we should know, that we have no affinity with |
the world, we have merely assumed our affinity with it, while
our affinity with God, Who is the illuminator and base of the
entire creation, is natural. This is reality, which should be known,
by the sattvika intellect. | _
_ Appendix—The purpose of knowing the truth of Pravrtti and
Nivriti, of what ought to be done and what ought not to be done,
of fear and fearlessness, of bondage and liberation, is only to
renounce affinity with the world. If affinity with the world is
not renounced, that knowledge is not real knowledge but that
is mere rot learning. . | .
The Sattvika intellect mentioned in the Gita enables a striver =”
to rise above the three gunas and to renounce his affinity with
_ the world. Therefore the striver possessing the Sattvika intellect,
reflects upon bondage and liberation—‘bandharh moksarh ca
yavetti’. In Sattviki intellect there is discrimination which 1s ;
transformed into Self-realization. The discriminative intellect knows
that all ‘upto the attainment of the abode of Brahma’ is bondage.

* There is a difference between ‘desire’ and 'need' (necessity). There is
desire for the worldly things while there is need for God. A desire remains
unfulfilled and is to be renounced while a need is fulfilled. If a person gives
up worldly desires, God is automatically realized. | :

such acts are forbidden for members of warrior class, trading
and labouring classes.

officers, should work for public welfare, by giving up their -

The path of work and renunciation, fear and fearlessness,

bondage and liberation mentioned in 'Sattvika'’ intellect, should

also be included in the expression, 'Eva ca’ (Even and). .

propensities, such as selfishness, partiality and inequanimity -

etc. So it cannot know what is right, and wrong; what is fear, :

and fearlessness; what ought to be done and what ought not;

and what are bondage, and liberation. | .
Attachment to a person, thing, incident, action and a

circumstance, causes aversion for other persons, things, incidents, -

actions and circumstances etc. A man, gets entangled in the

world, through attachment and aversion. When he gets attached -

to the world, he cannot know the reality of world. He can see

the reality of world, if he remains indifferent to it. But he can

know the Lord, by identifying himself with Him. 7
In sattvika intellect, discrimination is aroused, while in

rajasika intellect, it is veiled and becomes faint, because of

passion. So the intellect, does not remain pure, as water does

not ramain pure, when earth is mixed in it. Therefore, a person Be

people follow the ordinance of scriptures and the sacred books.
According to them, Dharma consists in going against scriptural
injunctions, and social decorum. _
'Sarvarthanviparitamsca'—They regard the body, as the self, =.
- and the perishable world, as real. They are non-believers. They
regard themselves, more learned than and superior, even to saints.
_ Instead of eternal bliss, they hanker after mundane pleasures,
_ considering these as real. They look upon vices, as virtues, and
the wrong, as right. They view all things, in a perverted light.
""Buddhih sa partha tamasi'—Intellect enveloped in darkness, ~

In the past a woman was the mistress of the house, now she is |

""Yaya svapnam bhayam Sokam visadam madameva ca na
vimuiicati durmedha dhrtih sa partha tamasi'—Because of
Tamasika Dhrti (firmness), a man does not give up excessive |
sleep, external and internal fear, grief, depression and conceit,
but he remains engrossed in these. He is sometimes, addicted
to too much sleep, and indolence, he at times entertains fear,
because of death, disease, dishonour, defame, insult, il health BS

and loss of wealth etc., he is off and on grieved and depressed,
while other times he is self-conceited, because of favourable
circumstances. | TO

Besides the above-mentioned evil propensities, other evils,
such as indolence, pride, hypocrisy, aversion, jealousy, violence
and usurpation etc., can be included in the expression ‘eva ca’
(and also). | | |

The Dhrti (firmness) which does not give up sleep, fear,
grief etc., is tamasika. | 7

In the thirty-third and thirty-fourth verses, the Lord by the
term 'Dharayate’ means, that sattvika and rajasika persons, hold
fast to the sattvika and rajasika Dhrti (firmness) respectively. But -
in the case of a tamasika person, it is not mentioned, that he
holds fast to tamasika firmness, because a Tamasika person outof -
ignorance, and delusion, is naturally so much engrossed in sleep
fear, grief and despair etc., that he does not give these evils up.

Out of these three kinds of Dhrti (firmness), in the Rajasika  —
and Tamasika firmness there is mention of a doer by the terms
‘Phalakanksi' and 'Durmedha’, while the doer has not been -
mentioned, in the Sattvika firmness, because in it the doer remains

: detached, and he has no sense of doership, while, in the rajasika
and tamasika firmness, the doer remains attached. .
:

This human life, has predominance of discrimination, which
is clearly revealed in a Sattvika person, and so the only aim of
his life is to realize God. In a RAajasika person, because of
dominance of attachment for mundane things and pleasure,
this discrimination, is not clearly revealed, yet by his feeble
discrimination, he wants to win pleasure, praise and. honour
etc., worldly and heavenly pleasure, hereafter, and he does not
act, against decorum. But a tamasika person's discrimination
is completely veiled, and he remains engrossed in tamasika
propensities, such as sleep, fear and grief etc.
"
1973,"Verse 36-37] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1923 -
In spiritual discipline, actions do not play such an important ;
role, as aim does. Actions, thoughts and trance performed, by
physical, subtle and causal bodies respectively, are all activities .
of bodies. But the aim, that he has to realize God, is decided by ;
the self. As is the aim, so are the actions. The aim, can be fixed
by Sattvika intellect, while a man holds firm to it, by Sattvika
firmness. So, from the thirty-third verse to the thirty-fifth verse, .
the Lord by addressing Arjuna as ‘Partha’ six times, warns him,
regarding him as a representative of strivers, that without worrying
about mundane persons and objects, he should hold fast, to his :
aim, by giving up rajasika and tamasika propensities. |
Appendix—The man, who is of the conviction that the evil
propensities such as (excessive) sleep, fear, grief, depression .
and conceit etc., can’t be removed, is evil minded. Such type
of people don’t pay any heed to give up evils, they don’t have 7
the courage to give them up but they own them naturally.
Excessive sleep is an obstacle to the progress of a striver. .
Necessary and moderate (regulated) sleep is not an obstacle
(Gita 6/16-17).

happiness, in which one rejoices by practice and surely achieves,
the end of pain. That happiness, which is like poison at first due to
worldly attachment, but as nectar at the end. That which springs
from the placidity of mind, brought about by meditation on God, —-
is said to be, sattvika. 36-37 S
Comment:—

""‘Bharatarsabha'—The Lord addresses Arjuna as Bharatarsabha,
the best of all the persons in the Bharata family, to emphasize the
fact, that it is easy for him to overcome the rajasika and tamasika
pleasures. He has overcome, the rajasika pleasure, because he  -
rejected the offer of a beautiful heavenly damsel named, Urvasi. _ -
Similarly, he has overcome the tamasika pleasure of sleep, and __
he is called 'GudakeSa’, the conqueror of sleep.

‘Sukham tu idanim'—Having classified knowledge, action,
agent, intellect and firmness, under three heads, the Lord, ~~
by using the term ‘Tu’, declares, that happiness is also of
three kinds. A fact needs special attention here. The main _
stumbling block to spiritual progress or God-realization, is the
desire for pleasure.

Even sattvika happiness, if anyone is attached to it, leads to
bondage. If a striver, is attached to happiness which he receives
out of adoration, meditation and even trance, it leads him to
bondage, by delaying him in God-realization (Gité 14/6). Now, ~
the question arises, whether eternal bliss of God-realization should
also not be enjoyed. In fact, eternal bliss is not enjoyed, it is
experienced or felt through self (Gita 5/21; 6/21, 28). If a striver,
does not enjoy happiness derived out of spiritual discipline, he
experiences, that eternal bliss, naturally. The Lord has used the.
term ‘Tu’, to divert the strivers’ attention, to eternal bliss.

Here the Lord by using the term ‘Idanim', means that Arjuna
wanted to know the true nature of renunciation (Sannyasa) and
the Discipline of Action (Tyaga); so in response to his query,
the Lord, classified abandonment, knowledge, action, agent and
firmness each, under three heads. But the aim of all of them, is
"
1975,"Verse 36-37] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1925 -
to derive pleasure (happiness). So, the Lord classifies happiness
under three heads.
'Trividham Srnu me'—People remain so much engrossed in -
rajasika and tamasika pleasure, that they cannot imagine that :
sattvika happiness, transcends them. So the Lord, asks Arjuna |
to choose Sattvika joy (happiness), by rejecting rajasika and |
the tamasika ones. Sattvika joy is conducive to God-realization, :
while Rajasika and Tamasika pleasure by entangling a man in
the world, lead him to a fall.
'‘Abhyasadramate yatra'—In Sattvika happiness, one rejoices by -
practice. An ordinary man cannot rejoice in it, without practice. In ;
rajasika and tamasika pleasure, there is no. need of any practice.
Beings are naturally attracted to rajasika and tamasika pleasure. .

The senses, are attracted towards sense-objects, mind and intellect

are attracted towards pleasure and prosperity, and there is an - |
inclination towards sleep, in the state of tiredness, naturally. All

beings like pleasure, born of sense-contacts, pride, praise and -
sleep etc. Even dogs get pleased, when they are honoured, and

displeased when they are dishonoured.

Now, the question arises, what sort of practice 1s required ;
to gain sattvika happiness. Hearing, thinking, study of scriptures
and removal of the rajasika and tamasika inclinations etc., are :
included in the term, ‘practice’.

A striver, should practise adoration and meditation etc., but ;
should not enjoy them. This is the meaning, which the Lord
wants to convey, by the expression ‘Abhyasadramate'’.

‘Duhkhantam ca nigacchati'—By practice, as a man develops
interest in and attraction for, Sattvika happiness, his sorrow comes -
to an end and he gains happiness or joy (Gita 2/65).

The Lord, by using the conjunction, 'Ca' (and) means to
convey that a striver cannot get rid of pain or sorrow, so long
as, he rejoices in Sattvika happiness. The reason is, that even
Sattvika happiness is born of placidity of mind and whatever is :
born, 1s perishable. So, how can the perishable, bring sorrow to
"
1976,"1926 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 18 -
an end? A striver, instead of being attached to sattvika happiness,
should transcend it. By doing so, his sorrows come to an end.
‘Atmabuddhiprasadajam'—The mind, instead of attaching -
importance to honour, praise, pleasure and prosperity, thinks
only of God. This thinking gives placidity of mind (Gita 2/64).
From placidity of mind accrues sattvika happiness. It means |
that when a man being totally detached from mundane contact :
born pleasure, gets his mind, merged in meditation on God, the
happiness experienced is said to be sattvika.
~ ""Yattadagre visamiva'—By the terms ‘Yat' (which) and ‘tat’ ”
(that), the Lord means to convey, that Sattvika happiness, has -
not yet been experienced or felt. A striver, has the only aim, to
gain it, but he experiences rajasika and tamasika pleasures. So
he faces difficulty in abandoning rajasika and tamasika pleasure,
because he has been enjoying these, since several births. But, -
he has not yet relished Sattvika happiness. So having no real
experience of Sattvika happiness, he initially finds it most |
unpleasant, like poison.
In fact, Sattvika happiness initially, is not like poison, but
it is unpleasant like poison, to abandon rajasika and tamasika :
pleasure. As a boy, takes more interest in play and recreation,
than in studies in the beginning, because he does not know
the importance of studies. But, when he goes on studying and °
gets success in examination, he becomes interested in studies, -
and then he attaches more importance to it. Similarly, people,
who are attached to tamasika and rajasika pleasure feel sattvika
_ happiness, like poison. But to those strivers, who are not attached
to mundane pleasure, who have an inclination for the study of
scriptures, for good company, loud chanting of divine name,
meditation and adoration etc., and whose knowledge, actions,
intellect and firmness, are sattvika, this happiness is like nectar,
to them from the very beginning. It is not unpleasant, taxing
and irksome to them.
'Pariname'mrtopamam'—A striver, develops the modes of
"
1977,"Verse 36-37] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1927 -
goodness through spiritual discipline. When the mode of goodness |
is predominant, the light of wisdom shines in the mind and

senses, and good virtues, such as peace and immutability etc., are _
revealed.* It is because of these virtues, that it is like nectar, at
the end. If this happiness is not enjoyed, a striver, attains eternal

bliss (Gita 5/21). Sattvika happiness is like nectar, at the end

because by gaining it, a man transcends rajasika and tamasika .
pleasure and his affinity with matter is renounced, which leads

him to God-realization. ,

'Tatsukham sattvikarn proktam'—Happiness which is gained by -
good company, study of the scriptures, loud chanting, meditation -
and adoration etc., is neither like pleasure gained by honour,
praise and prosperity etc., nor like the pleasure which one derives .
out of heedlessness, indolence and excessive sleep etc., but it is
happiness gained by having affinity with God. So it has been oT
said to be, Sattvika (of the nature of goodness).

Appendix—lIn the fourteenth chapter, the Lord declared that
Sattvika happiness binds the Self—‘sukhasangena badhnati’ (14/6),
but here He declares that by Sattvika happiness, sorrows come to.
an end. It means that if a striver enjoys the Sattvika happiness, -
it binds him (self) viz., does not let him rise above the three
modes. But if he does not enjoy it, then by it, his sorrows end.

By enjoying happiness, sorrows don’t come to an end. Having
renounced enjoyment (pleasure), Yoga is attained. He should -
remain unconcerned and detached from the Sattvika happiness.

The attachment leads the striver to Rajoguna which binds him.

When Sattvaguna is mixed with Rajoguna, it is conducive to a

downfall (ruin).

The Sattvika happiness appears like poison initially because :
a striver does not attach importance to discrimination. A Rajasa
person does not value discrimination. Therefore appearance of the
Sattvika happiness initially like poison is because of Rajoguna.

* The three modes—of goodness, of passion and of ignorance abide in the |
mind unrevealed. They are known by their distinctive characteristics as described
from the eleventh to the thirteenth verses of the fourteenth chapter.
"
1978,"1928 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA _ {Chapter 18
It means that Sattvika: happiness is not painful but because of :
_ the effect of Rajoguna in one’s intellect, the Sattvika happiness
- appears to be painful like poison. He aims at Sattvika happiness .
but inwardly he is passionate (Rajasa). |

_ Happiness, which is derived from the contact of senses with

Comment:— | - |
'Visayendriyasamyogat'—-Happiness, which is derived from
contact of senses, with their objects, does not need any practice.
Every being, including a beast, a bird, an insect or a germ, 7
derives this happiness, without doing any practice. A man, since
his childhood has been pleased in favourable, and displeased in
unfavourable, circumstances. So, in this. passionate happiness, :
there is no need for practice. - -
""Yattadagre'mrtopamam'-—The Lord declares, that passionate
happiness, is like nectar, at first. It means, that when a passionate
man wishes to enjoy such happiness, and when he begins to
enjoy it, he derives a lot of happiness, but when he goes on
enjoying it, the joy is gradually reduced and then he develops
disinclination, towards it. Even then, if he goes on enjoying it,
he experiences, a burning sensation and pain. Therefore, it is said
that happiness appears like nectar only in its initial stage. -
Further, these sensual pleasures seem very pleasant, when
people hear of these and when mind is attracted, towards them. But
"
1979,"Verse 38] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1929 .
when they are enjoyed, they are not, so pleasant. So in the Gita,
it is declared—When unwise people, hear of heavenly pleasure,
they get deeply attached to these (Gita 2/42) and hanker after -
them. But when they actually enjoy heavenly pleasure, they do a
not find these, much pleasant and attractive.
_ *Pariname visamiva'—Sensual pleasures, seem very pleasant
at first, but when a person goes on enjoying them, these have :
bitter and evil consequences, and so those pleasures turn into
poison. These sensual pleasures, lead a man to eighty-four lac
forms, of lives, prisons, hell and sorrow because the fruit of
rajasika action, is sorrow (Gita 14/16).
It is because of passion (attachment), that people have to
suffer pain. A man, who was rich in the past, but has become ,
poor now, has to undergo more suffering, than a person, who
has always been poor. Similarly, a person who tasted different -
kinds of dishes, feels a shortage, when he gets a meagre meal.
This feeling of shortage, causes pain. |
A man, makes efforts to fulfil his desire. He may either
succeed or fail in fulfilling it. If he. succeeds, it gives birth to ;
other desires but if he fails, he feels sad and dejected, and again
tries to satisfy it. Thus a cycle of desire goes on, without an end
their consequences like poison, are bitter. , |
Now, a question arises here that persons who enjoy passionate :
pleasure should die, like men who take poison. The answer is,
that passionate happiness, does not kill a man, as poison does,
but a person develops disinclination for it, as he has for poison. It
means, that passionate happiness, is not poison, but 1s like poison.
Passionate happiness is like poison, because it goes on killing :
a man for several births, whereas poison, kills only once. A
man, possessing passionate happiness cannot get peace, even
in heaven, because there also he is jealous of his superiors and
equals, and is proud of his achievement, after seeing those, who
are inferior to him. Moreover, they have to return to the world
of mortals, when their merit, is exhausted (Gita 9/21). Again,
"
1980,"1930 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18
after coming to the mortal world, they perform virtuous actions 7
and reap their fruits, in heaven. Thus, they follow, a cycle of

birth and death (9/21). If, because of their attachment, they are -
engaged in sinful acts, they have to take birth, in eighty-four .
lac forms of lives and go to hell and then follow a cycle of :
birth and death, endlessly. So this happiness has been called,

like poison, at the end.

""Tatsukham rajasarh smrtam'—In the thirty-seventh verse, the
Lord used the term ‘Proktam', for Sattvika happiness, while he has
used the verb 'Smrtam’ here. It means, that a man knows that the -
result of Rajasika happiness, is sorrow or pain, yet he hankers after
it, because of his attachment to it. If he thinks of its consequences,
he will not be entangled, in rajasika happiness. Moreover, in
scripture and history, there are several examples, which remind
that rajasika happiness, results in -pain or sorrow. So the term
‘smrtam’, has been used to remind him, of its evil consequences.

A man of sattvika nature, instead of paying attention, to .
instantaneous happiness, thinks of its result, while a man of
rajasika nature, instead of thinking of the result, is engaged
in instantaneous happiness. So, he remains entangled, in the ;
worldly snare. The Lord declares, ""Pleasures which are born of
sense-contacts, are verily, sources of pain, though these appear :
as enjoyable, to worldly minded people, at first"" (Gita 5/22). So
a striver, instead of being entangled in the rajasika happiness, ;
should develop dispassion, for the world. |

Appendix—The happiness which is derived from sense-
contacts is like nectar at the beginning but is like poison at
the end. An indiscriminative person attaches importance to the -
beginning stage. The beginning does not persist forever but the
desire for sensual pleasures ever remains which is the root of all
sufferings. But a discriminative person instead of perceiving the
beginning, perceives its result, therefore he does not get attached
to those pleasures—‘na tesu ramate budhah’ (Gita 5/22). Only :
a man has got the ability to perceive the result. The man who
"
1981,"Verse 39] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1931 .
does not see the result is of a beastly nature. :
In fact the beginning (union) is not important but the end
(disunion) is important. A man wants the happiness of the -
beginning but it does not stay because ‘union changes into
disunion—this is the rule. The beginning is transient but the |
end is eternal. The desire for the transient causes sufferings.
The disunion of the entire universe is eternal. But because of the .
Rajasi disposition, union appears to be pleasant. If a man does
not relish the pleasure at the beginning, he will ever be totally
free from sorrows (sufferings). ‘Having an eye on the beginning’ z
is “bhoga’ and ‘seeing the consequences’ is ‘Yoga’. |
The pleasure, which appears by the union of the world, is
mixed with pain. But by being disunited from the world, there is .
constant bliss which transcends both pleasure and pain (sorrows).

Happiness which deludes the self both at the beginning and at |

Comment:— ; |
'Nidralasyapramadottham'—-Excessive attachment, transforms
itself into a mode of ignorance, which is called delusion. It |
is because of delusion, that a man wants to sleep for a long
time, even though he does not get sound sleep. Without sound
sleep, he ramains lethargic and he goes on dreaming. His time
is wasted. But a man, of tamasika nature, derives happiness out
of this sort of sleep.
A man of the mood of ignorance, remains indolent. He wastes
"
1982,"1932 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18
his time in idleness and goes on postponing, even obligatory -
duties. He derives pleasure, out of this indolence. Being idle

his senses and mind etc., become inactive, and he only thinks ;
of futile worldly affairs, which lead him to pain, sorrow, WOITy
and disquietude. :

He becomes careless, and the mode of ignorance, is enhanced.

He does not perform his obligatory duties, but indulges in idle
pursuits, such as smoking, drinking, displays etc., and evil, such
as theft, robbery, falsehood, fraud, forgery and in the forbidden
food etc. .

Such a person, derives pleasures out of indolence, as well -
as heedlessness. It is because of this nature, labourers want
to get full wages, without performing their duty honestly and |
sincerely, physicians charge fees from patients again and again,
without giving them proper treatment, and milkmen, mix water -
in milk, though they charge the cost of the pure milk. This,
sinful heedlessness, leads them to hell.

Heedlessness, veils discrimination, while sleep and indolence,
covers the mode of goodness. When discrimination is veiled,
heedlessness is revealed, and when light is covered, indolence -
and sleep are exposed. A tamasika person, derives pleasure out
of sleep, indolence and heedlessness. So tamasika happiness is
said to arise, from these three. :

Sleep is of two kinds—moderate and excessive.

(1) Moderate sleep—sleep provides rest, purity and freshness.

It provides strength and zeal, for mundane, as well as, spiritual .
activities. Sleep is not a defect, it is essential (Gita 6/17) and
provides one freshness and energy to perform mundane and
spiritual acts promptly.

Sleep is essential for a striver, for his invigoration. A striver,
free from worldly pursuits gets sleep, very soon. He who is ,
engrossed in worldly thoughts, cannot get sleep quickly. This |
"
1983,"Verse 39] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1933 -
proves, that affinity with the world, does not allow a person to
enjoy sleep. In sound sleep, connection with the world snaps,
and one gets linked with God. Thus sound sleep, gives vitality
and energy to be engaged, in spiritual practice. -
Sleep is tamasika. It contains two elements—unconsciousness
and rest. The former, causes delusion which is to be shunned, ~ .
while the latter, is moderate which is to be adopted. Good strivers, |
through spiritual discipline, can get much rest and happiness, even
during wakefulness, because they remain fixed in God, without :
thinking of worldly affairs. If they do not get attached, even to -
rest, and happiness, they attain God-realization. | -
Strivers, should not go to bed, for rest but they should think :
that they are going to devote that time, in adoration and devotion, :
by lying down on a cot, as they adore the Lord, during a day, oo .
by performing various duties.
(2) Excessive sleep—Excessive sleep, makes a man indolent
and he feels drowsy, all the time. In the eighth verse of the ;
fourteenth chapter, the Lord used first heedlessness, then indolence
and finally sleep, while He has reversed the order here. The reason -
is, that there is a link how they bind all embodied beings, but here
the context is, how they degrade, a man. As far as binding force,
is concerned, the first and foremost position, goes to heedlessness. —
It conduces a man to perform forbidden actions, which ruin him. ;
Indolence hinders a man, from performing virtuous actions. So, |
it has been given, the second place. As far as sleep is concerned,
it is only excessive sleep, not a moderate one, which binds a |
man. So, the third place has been allowed to sleep. But in this
verse, the order is changed, because moderate sleep, does not -
cause harm and it is only excessive sleep, which is conducive to
ruin. Indolence leads more to ruin than sleep, while heedlessness
contributes the most. Excessive sleep will lead a man to lower
births, while indolence and heedlessness, will lead him to heil*
* Heedlessness conduces a man to undertake idle pursuits for the sake
of diversion. But when passion (attachment) joins heedlessness, both give :
"
1984,"1934 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
by depriving him, of his discrimination.

_ 'Yadagre canubandhe ca sukham mohanamatmanah'—
Happiness, which arises, from sleep, indolence and heedlessness,
deludes the self both at the beginning, and at the end. Beings .
lose their discrimination, under the influence of this happiness. So
birds, beasts, moths and insects etc., do not think, what ought to
be done, at the beginning and also do not think of consequences.

Such happiness, 1s declared to be tamasika.

(1) Prakrti (matter) and Purusa (Soul or Spirit), are two |
different entities, and both of them are without beginning. :
The knowledge, by which one knows their difference, is also
beginningless. Knowledge (discrimination), is possessed by
Purusa (Soul or Spirit or Self), not by Prakrti. But, when Purusa -
disregarding this discrimination, assumes affinity with Prakrti,
because of this affinity, attachment arises.*

When attachment, remains in its subtle form, there is |
dominance of discrimination. But when attachment enhances,
discrimination is covered. But if discrimination, 1s revealed -
properly, attachment perishes and then, a person is called,
liberated. It is because of attachment, that a man runs after
worldly pleasure, born of Prakrti. If he wants to gain sattvika |
happiness, he faces difficulty in renouncing rajasika, and
tamasika happiness. But when attachment perishes, the poison-
like happiness, turns into nectarine happiness. It is because of
attachment, that rajasika (passionate) happiness, seems like nectar
at first, but like poison at the end. Attachment to passionate
happiness, leads a man to endless pain and sorrow.
birth to desire. It is out of desire that a man commits several sins and crimes
whose consequences are very horrible.

* Because of attachment several evils are born in Prakrti, not in Purusa.

A man (Self) by identifying himself with Prakrti (Matter) assumes the evils of
Prakrti in him and so he has to be an enjoyer (Bhogt). But when he realizes
that the evils appear and disappear while he remains the same without any
modification, he becomes equanimous (a Yog!).
"
1985,"Verse 39] ‘SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1935 -

When this attachment is transformed into the mode of |
ignorance, a man, wastes his time in sleep, indolence, and he
indulges in idle pursuits, by giving up his duty. But a tamasika
person, derives happiness out of it. So it deludes the self, both -
at the beginning and at end. :

(2) Actually the kaleidoscopic world, does not exist, while
God, Who is Truth, Knowledge and Bliss consolidated, and Who :
is the base and illuminator of the unreal, always exists. Man
(soul or self), being a fragment of God, is also truth, knowledge
and bliss consolidated. But, when he has desire for the unreal, ~
his bliss, becomes veiled. But, as soon as, he abandons desire, -
his natural bliss is revealed. .

When sattvika intellect, merges in eternal bliss, it becomes
pure. Natural bliss, which is experienced by pure intellect, is
called sattvika happiness. When man's affinity with this pure OO
intellect, 1s renounced, there remains, natural bliss, only. Bliss
is named sattvika happiness, because of its affinity with sattvika
intellect, otherwise, it is nothing, besides eternal bliss. __ .

When a man has a desire to gain something, the mind and
the intellect get attached to it. But, as soon as, he gains it, his -
attachment or attraction is abandoned, and he becomes free from
pain, which he suffered because of its deficit and he realizes the
reflection of the eternal self-evident bliss, immediately. In fact, he
does not gain happiness, by acquiring a thing, but by being free
from attachment to it. But, a rajasika person, out of ignorance,
thinks that it is so, because he has got the thing. Union, with
the thing is external, while happiness is, something internal. So,
how can external union cause, internal happiness? The fact is, |
that internal happiness is derived by renouncing internal affinity,
with a thing. It means, that when the thing is secured, internal
affinity with the thing, is renounced. As soon as, this affinity is
renounced, eternal natural bliss, is experienced.

During sleep, when intellect merges with the mode of :
ignorance, a man forgets all things and objects, of his wakeful
"
1986,"1936 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18
state. Their memory, is cause of pain. So, by forgetting these he
derives happiness, out of sleep. But, because of the mmpurity of
intellect, he does not experience natural bliss. So, the happiness ;
which arises from sleep, is called. 'tamasika', (of the mode of |
ignorance).* — | : |
It means, that'a sattvika person derives happiness, by having
disinclination for the world, when his intellect merges in the
self; a rajasika person, by abandonment of attachment to things,
while a tamasika person, by forgetting his duty and indulging in
idle pursuits. Thus, natural bliss is veiled, by assumed affinity -
with, the unreal. But happiness experienced, by all the Sattvika,
Rajasika and Tamasika people, is nothing, but a reflection of the  =—
eternal natural, bliss. So, if we renounce attachment to the three
kinds of happinesses, we may progress, spiritually. So a striver
should abandon, the three kinds of happinesses. _ -
Appendix—A Tamasa person is endowed with delusion—
_ ‘tamastvajiianajarh viddhi mohanarh sarvadehinam’ (Gita 14/8). |
Delusion is an obstacle in the use of discrimination. Because of
the Tamasi disposition, discrimination is not aroused. Therefore the
discrimination of a Tamasi person, because of delusion disappears, -
so he does not see the beginning or the end at all.

* During sleep a man's intellect gets deluded i.e., it becomes unconscious.
The man derives happiness, by forgetting the world. So this happiness is called
Tamasika. If intellect with senses is not deluded, it becomes a state of trance,
which provides rest. A man can transcend the three modes of nature only, if
he is not attached to this happiness derived out of trance. . |
.  Prakrti is active and kaleidoscopic, while God is eternal, calm, immutable,
flawless, steady and He does not undergo any modifications. During sleep, a
man gets established in Him. But as his mind is attracted towards pleasure and
prosperity, after waking, he hankers after prosperity and pleasure. Thus because
of his attachment to prosperity and pleasure he cannot remain established either
in God or the self. If one renounces this attachment, he can remain established,
in the self naturally. |

Comment:— - .
[At the beginning of this chapter, Arjuna desired to know |
severally, the true nature of renunciation (Sannyasa) and
_ Tyaga (Karmayoga). So the Lord, first described Karmayoga. . -
Winding up the topic the Lord declared, ""Pleasant, unpleasant
and mixed—threefold, is‘ the fruit of action, accruing to those |
who have not relinquished the fruit. But there is none whatever,
for those who have relinquished the fruit."" Having declared so,
im the thirteenth verse, by beginning the topic of Sankhyayoga ""
(Discipline of Knowledge), He explained five factors, which
contribute to the accomplishment of action. In the sixteenth and
seventeenth verses, He decried those, who look upon the self,
as doer and praised those, who are free from egoistic notion. In
the eighteenth verse, He mentioned the factors, which motivate
action and also the constituents of actions, while the self is free,
from incitement and constituents. Then, He classified knowledge,
action, agent, intellect, dhrti and happiness into three kinds.
While describing the three kinds of happiness, He explained ©
the superiority of sattvika happiness to rajasika and tamasika,
though all the three are derived by having affinity with Prakrti.
- But, the real joy which transcends, the three modes of nature,
is unique and supreme (Gita 6/21). |
Even the sativika happiness, is not eternal, because the Lord
"
1988,"1938 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 _
has declared, that it springs from placidity of mind and whatever -
is born, is not eternal. The Lord means that a striver, has to rise
above this sattvika happiness, also. By transcending the nature
and its three modes, he has to realize the real bliss of God or
the self. So the Lord declares—] : :
‘Na tadasti prthivyam va divi devesu va punah'—Here, the
term 'Prthivyam’, denotes mortal worlds, as well as, other lower |
worlds, than the earth. 'Divi' denotes heaven, 'Devesu', denotes all
beings, such as men, gods, demons, devils, birds, beasts, insects,
trees and plants etc., whether moving or non-moving, while the _
expression 'Va punah’, denotes infinite universes. It means, that ;
either in the celestial world, or in the middle region or in the -
terrestrial world, im infinite universes, there is no object or being, .
free from these three modes of nature. All of these are connected
with the three modes of nature. So
‘Sattvam prakrtijairmuktam yadebhih syattribhirgunaih'—
Nature and its evolutes, are of three modes and are ever changing.
A man, is bound by having connection with these and he is
liberated, by renouncing a connection with them, because the
self is pure and it undergoes no modifications. Connection with .
nature, gives birth to egoism, which makes one dependent, though
he feels, that he is independent. An egoistic notion gives birth
to attachment and desire etc. Therefore, in fact he becomes ;
dependent on persons and things etc. So, one should be free ;
from the modes, of nature. | |
A striver, first of all should enhance the mode of goodness
by abandoning modes of passion and ignorance. In the mode
of goodness also, a man should not be attached to happiness
and knowledge, because attachment to them, binds him. So he -
should transcend the mode of goodness, by abandoning attachment.
First, he should mould his life, by possessing sattvika knowledge,
action, intellect, dhrti and happiness etc., because discrimination
(wisdom), remains aroused in them. This discrimination induces
him to be free from affinity, with 'Prakrti'. But, finally he should :
transcend them also, by abandoning attachment for them.
"
1989,"Verse 41] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1939 -
Appendix—lIn the tenth chapter from the devotion (faith) point
of view, the Lord declared that all things originate from Him—-‘na
tadasti vina yatsyanmaya bhitarh caracaram’ (10/39). Here from |
the view point of knowledge (discrimination), the Lord declares -
that all beings emanate from the modes born of nature. The reason |
is that from the view point of a discriminative person the real
and the unreal—both exist; but from the viewpoint of a devotee
only God exists—‘sadasaccahamarjuna’ (Gita 9/19). In the path of
discrimination, the renunciation of the unreal viz., of the modes
is important but in devotion relationship with God is important. -
An ignorant person, rather than an enlightened soul, holds :
that there is no being in the universe that is free from the three
modes. An enlightened soul has an eye on the Self which is by |
nature free from gunas (modes) (Gita 13/31).

Link:—While discussing the nature of 'Tyaga’, the Lord
declared, ""Abandonment of any duty, that ought to be done, is .
not right. Its abandonment through ignorance, is declared to be,
of the nature of ignorance"" (18/7). ""He who gives up duty for
fear of physical suffering, performs 'Tyaga' of the 'Rajasika' kind :
(18/8), while he who performs a prescribed duty, as a thing that |
ought to be done, abandoning attachment and the fruit—his
Tyaga is regarded as, Sattvika"" (18/9). ""In the Sankhyayoga, |
while explaining the five factors for accomplishment of actions, °
the Lord declared, ""An action which is obligatory, is performed
without attachment, or hate, by one who seeks no reward, is said
to be sattvika"" (18/23). The Lord, resumes the topic of obligatory
actions (duties), allotted to members of four Varnas (Castes)— |
Brahmana, Ksatriya, Vaisya and Sidra, also of Bhaktiyoga.

Comment:— _

'Brahmanaksatriyavisam Sidranam ca parantapa'—Here, the |
Brahmanas, the Ksatriyas and the Vaisyas are included, in one
category, while the Siidras are put in a different category. The
former three are 'Dvijas' (Twice born), as they are eligible for
initiation, and so they wear a sacred thread, known as 'Yajnopavita’, -
while the fourth, is not eligible to wear the sacred thread. For ~
the latter different duties have been allotted, according to their
caste, as ordained by scriptures. | oe

'Karmani pravibhaktani svabhavaprabhavairgunaih’— Actions,
which a man performs, leave their impressions in his mind, BO
and these impressions, determine his nature. Thus nature
which is formed by impressions of actions of innumerable life .
times, give birth to propensities, of the modes of. goodness,
of passion and of ignorance. The four castes—Brahmana,
Ksatriya, Vaisya and Sidra, and their obligatory duties, have
been allocated according to the propensities of those modes
(Gita 4/13), because a man acts, according to propensities, of
the mode he possesses. :

(1)

Actions are of two kinds (i) Those, that enable a being
to be born, in high and low wombs (11) Those, which create .
desirable and undesirable circumstances, and which have been
called, good, evil and mixed, 1.e., the threefold fruit, of action,
in the Gita (18/12).

A serious thought, reveals that all actions create desirable
and undesirable circumstances. A man bor in a high family, :
receives honour, while a man born in a low family, does not.
"
1991,"Verse 41] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1941 -
But, it is not necessary that the former is always honoured, |
while the latter always dishonoured. So far as the second type .
of actions, are concerned, they always create, either desirable or :
undesirable circumstances. :
A man is free, in making proper use of both, the desirable
and undesirable circumstances. Those who feel happy in desirable |
circumstances, and sad in undesirable ones, are ignorant, while |
those who use these as means for spiritual progress, are wise. |
The reason is, that this human life has been bestowed upon us,
so that we may realize God. So, all the circumstances, are the -
means to realize Him. -
Now the question arises as to how the desirable and undesirable -
circumstances, are conducive to spiritual progress. The answer 7
is, that in desirable circumstances a striver, should serve others, _ |
while in undesirable circumstances, he should give up desire for
desirable circumstances. Thus, both of these can serve, as means
to progress, spiritually. -
(2) |
In the scriptures, it is mentioned that virtuous actions lead a -
being to heaven, evil actions to hell, while an equality of virtuous
and evil actions, leads him to human life. It shows, that no
man, can be either wholly virtuous or wholly evil. Out of those .
virtuous and evil actions also, in a certain field, virtues may be
more, while in other spheres evils may be more:* Similar is the
division of modes. Those who have predominance of the mode
of goodness, go to higher regions, those, who have predominance
of the mode of passion, go to the middle regions, viz., region of
* As in an examination an examinee may obtain poorer marks in a certain
subject and better marks in other subjects. But the result is declared on the base
of the aggregate marks. Similarly a man's virtuous actions may be more in one
sphere while evil actions may be more in other sphere. It is the aggregate of
the two which decides his birth. If the virtues and evils of different persons
are equal in different spheres, they should receive happy and sad circumstances
equally. But it does not generally happen. Similar is the case with the modes
of nature as that of Sattvika etc.
"
1992,"1942 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
men, while those having dominance of the mode of ignorance,
go to the lower regions. Out of those going to a region, they are
again divided into different categories, according to their qualities.

Those who have predominance of the mode of goodness, are -
born as Brahmanas; those, who have predominance of the mode
of passion and the mode of goodness, occupy the secondary
place, are born as Ksatriyas; those, who have predominance of
the mode of passion, while the mode of ignorance is secondary,
are born as Vaisyas; and those, with the predominance of the
mode of ignorance, are born as Sidra. Out of these four Varnas -
(castes) also, there are Brahmanas of the low and high classes -
according to their birth. Moreover, favourable and the unfavourable -
circumstances are also different, in different cases. Similar, is the
case in other Varnas (castes) also. So in the Gita, it has been 7
declared, that there is no being, in the three worlds that is free
from the three modes born, of nature (18/40).

Similar, is the case with animals and birds, etc., also. A cow -
is regarded as superior to a dog, a donkey or a pig. A pigeon, is
regarded as superior to a crow, or a kite. All of these do not get, 7
similar desirable and undesirable circumstances. It means, that
among the beings of a region also, there is a lot of difference,
in their circumstances etc. | }

_ Appendix—In the fourth chapter the Lord declared, ‘the .
four-fold caste (order) (varna) was created by Me, according to
the modes of their nature and actions’—‘gunakarmavibhagasah’
(4/13); and here He declares that the respective duties of the
four castes have been allocated according to the modes born of
their nature—‘svabhavaprabhavairgunaih’. In the fourth chapter
there is mention of the creation of the four ‘varnas’; while here
is mention of the duties of the four varnas. It means that in
the fourth chapter the Lord explained that people are born in
different castes (Varnas) according to the modes and actions of
the previous birth; while here He explains the respective duties
of the people of the four castes, according to the performance

having any crookedness, fraud and knavery in the mind, is known
uprightness (Arjavam).

records, and fully grasping their teachings and meanings, as well __
"
1994,"1944 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18
as, the awareness of what ought to be done and what ought to
he refrained from, is ‘Jnana’.

'Vijiianam'—The proper method and observance of religious
sacrifice (yajfia), according to Vedas and scriptures, is known 'Vijfiana’.

'Astikyam'—Firm belief in God, the Vedas, the scriptures and .

life after death, and translation of their teachings into practice,
is 'Astikyam’. ee ee

'Brahmakarma.svabhavajam'—A Brahmana's temperament,
is naturally suited to the performance of these above-mentioned
duties, such as serenity and self-control etc., he experiences no
difficulty in performing them. | |

A Brahmana who has the predominance of mode of goodness,
whose forefathers have been pure and whose actions of the
previous birth, are pure, faces no difficulty in possessing the

_ above-mentioned, nine qualities. In his life, the actions of ~
earning livelihood occupy a secondary place. As far as, the
people of other three Varnas (castes), are concerned, because
of predominance of the modes of passion and ignorance, their
actions, of earning their livelihood also, are included, in natural
actions. Therefore, in the Gita, in the duties of a Brahmana, only -
actions which involve these qualities, not those of livelihood,
have been included. —

_ Appendix—lIf the Varna tradition has been properly followed,
a Brahmana naturally possesses these qualities. But if a hybrid ~~
is born viz., if there is an inter-mixture of castes, then the
Brahmanas don’t naturally possess these qualities, there is
deviation in those qualities.

In the preceding verse the expression ‘svabhava prabhavai-
rgunaih’ was used, therefore here the Lord mentions “svabhavaja .
karma’. In the formation of nature (temperament) the first
importance goes to birth and then the company a person keeps,
is important. By company, by the study of books (self-study)
and by practice etc., the nature changes. |

his nature. :
"
1997,"Verse 44] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1947 -

Pure trade consists, in supplying the needs of the, people by ”
transporting the commodities, from one place to another, sincerely
and honestly, so that no one may feel a shortage.

Lord Krsna, (because of his relationship with Nanda-Baba), |
regarded himself as a Vaisya.* So he himself grazed cows and
calves. In the Manusmrti (the code of Manu) it is mentioned,
that the duty of a Vaisya is cow-rearing. So Lord Krsna exhorts
Vaisyas, at least to rear cows, if they cannot raise all cattle.

So, the Vaisyas should bring up cows, by applying all their
resources, body, mind, power and riches. _

A cow is to be reared from every point of view. Human beings -
can attain, four important aims of life, through cow-rearing—these :
are money (artha), righteousness (Dharma), desire (Kama) and —
salvation (Moksa). In the materialistic world of today, a cow is
very useful. Her milk, churned butter and dung, add to the wealth
of a nation. Our country, is an agricultural country. So _bullocks,
are used to plough the land. The land, can also be ploughed by
male-buffaloes, or camels. But bullocks, are superior to them. -
Buffaloes cannot work so efficiently, as bullocks because the
latter have more sattvika strength, than the former. The latter can
work for a longer time, in the sun, than the former. Moreover,
the number of the buffaloes is smaller than that of bullocks. As ;
far as camels, are concerned, they cost more than bullocks. If
cows are reared, they give birth to bullocks. So bullocks are not
to be bought. Bullocks born of foreign cows cannot be used in
farming, because ploughs cannot be put on their necks, as they
have no withers.

The cow is a sacred animal. The air which touches her body
becomes pure. Her dung and urine, check epidemics, such as
plague and cholera etc. Houses plastered with dung, are not

_* Agriculture, trade, cow-rearing and lending money for interest are
the duties of a Vaisya. But cow-rearing has been our profession since time |
immemorial (Srimadbha. 10/24/21).

so much affected by bombs, as the cemented houses. Dung ~
eliminates poison. In Banarasa, a saint saved a man, who was
supposed to be dead by snake-bite, by smearing his body with
dung, two times. Urine of cow, is very useful in heart diseases.
A little quantity of urine of a she-calf, as a dose everyday, cures
stomach diseases. A saint, suffering from asthma had a lot of
relief, by drinking a little urme of the she-calf. In these days, |
several medicines are prepared from the dung and urine of cows.

Gas is also prepared from dung, for cooking purpose. —

The grains produced by the dung and urine of the cows as_~_
manure, is pure. Dung and urine of cows, make the land more
fertile than chemical fertilizers, as was once experimented, ona —
crop of grapes. Chemical fertilizers, destroy the fertility of land
in a few years, and makes it barren, while the manure of cow |
dung and urine, maintains well its fertility. Cow-dung is being me
exported to foreign countries, so that the lost fertility of land
there, may be restored. _

Cows of our country are gentle and sattvika. So their sattvika
milk sharpens intellect and makes their nature mild. Foreign cows
give more quantity of milk, but as they are angry by nature, their -
milk makes us, cruel. A she-buffalo gives more milk than a cow,
but her milk is not sattvika. Those who drink cows' milk, are |
more active than those who drink a she-buffalo's milk. Once, an :
experiment was made on military horses and it was found that .
horses fed on cow-milk, could cross a river, while the horses fed
on buffalo-milk, could not, though the latter seemed stronger.

The milk of she-camel, being tamasika is not useful and its curd
and butter, are not prepared. In the Jurisprudence, it is mentioned ;
that camels, dogs and donkeys etc., are untouchable.

Cows occupy an important place in all religious rites. Her
milk, churned butter (ghee) and dung etc., are used in nites of
birth, tonsure and sacred thread etc. Cow-dung purifies, a place.
Cow's milk is used in preparing sweet dishes which are offered |
to Brahmanas, in honour of manes. A cow is offered as charity,
"
1999,"Verse 44] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI _ 1949 -
to a Brahmana, to escape hell. In religious ceremonies a mixture -
of dung, urine, milk, curd and churned butter (ghee), known as
'‘Paficagavya’ is used. : : |

Her ghee, is used in religious sacrifices, which are performed :
to satisfy desires. In the Raghu family, cow had an important °
place. Her milk and ghee, are nourishing. .

_ Service to the cow without expectation of any reward, |
leads to salvation and purifies the heart. Lord Krsna is known
as Gopala, because He staged a human play, as a cowherd, with
bare-feet. In ancient times sages reared cows and their milk and ~
ghee, sharpened their intellect. So they could produce great and -
rare classics (literature). Cow's milk and butter, provided them :
longevity, so a synonym of ghee (butter), is ‘Ayu’. Great emperors, ”
went to those sages for consultation.

In historical records, there are names mentioned of innumerable BO
persons, who sacrificed their lives, for the protection of cows. But
how sad it is, that today thousands of cows are being slaughtered ;
daily, out of greed! If this state of affairs continues, cows will
totally disappear. Then cow-dung will not be available. Without
cow-dung lands will grow barren, and there will be no production -
of corn and cotton (cloth). People will be deprived of the bare
necessities of life, such as food, water and clothes and they will
have to lead a miserable life. The nation, will become dependent
and weak. Slaughter of cows, is the main cause of famines, -
droughts, volcanoes and strifes etc. So it is our first and foremost
duty, to stop this slaughter, with might and main.

We should rear cows, use their milk and butter, use cow-
dung-gas, for cooking, make cow-pens, in order to protect them,
protect the existing pastures (grazing grounds) and press the
government to leave more areas of land, free for pastures. The
policy of cow-slaughter, should be opposed and government
should be forced, through public opinion to enforce a law to
stop cow-slaughter immediately, throughout the country, for the |
protection of the country.

2000,"1950 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
'Paricaryatmakarn karma éudrasyapi svabhavajam'—It is |
the duty of a Sidra, to render service to the people of the four
Varnas (Castes), with all his resources. : |
Here, a doubt rises how can a Sidra, who is born with :
predominance of the mode of ignorance, endowed with seven evil |
propensities, such as ignorance, heedlessness, indolence, sleep,
unillumination, inactivity and delusion (Gita 14/8,14,17), render
service to others? The clarification is, that it is mentioned in the
Gita, that those possessing the mode of goodness go upwards to
the higher regions, the passionate remain in the middle region.
. (mortal world) while those steeped in ignorance, sink downwards |
(Gita 14/18). If a being dies, when Rajas (the mode of passion) -
is predominant in him, he is born among men who are attached
to action (Gita 14/15). It means that all human beings, have
predominance of the mode of passion. All these human beings have -
further been divided into fourfold caste (social order), according
to the predominance of their modes—sattvika, rajasa or tamasa.
So performance of action is important, for all human beings. ""
Therefore, a human birth, has been called 'Karmayoni' (Birth
for action). In the Gita also, while mentioning the duties of the .
four social orders, the Lord mentions the expressions 'Svabhavaja
Karma’ and 'Svabhavaniyata Karma’. So all men, are inclined to
perform actions. Thus, service is the duty of a Sudra, born of |
his nature and it involves no exertion for him.
The temperament of a Brahmana, a Ksatriya or a VaiSya, is
dominated by discrimination and they also possess purity, while
because of predominance of delusion, a Siidra's discrimination,
is veiled. It is because of his veiled discrimination, that he
has predominance of obedience and service, he has a natural
inclination, for service. So service to members of the four Varnas,
by obeying them and by affording them facilities, in carrying out
their vocational and daily duties, is his natural duty.
The nature of the embodied soul which is sentient and
"
2001,"Verse 44] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1951 -
Prakrti which is insentient, are different. The sentient, never ”
undergoes any modifications, while Prakrti being kaleidoscopic
ever undergoes modifications. The self (soul or spirit), being
a fragment of the Lord, is sentient. There is no connection
between the sentient and the insentient. But its attachment to ""
the insentient Prakrti, becomes the cause of Its birth in good
and evil wombs (Gita 13/21). Thus men are born, according to
their qualities (modes), because of their attachment with them
as Brahmanas, Ksatriyas, Vaisyas or Siidras. All of them have a |
natural inclination to their duties, mentioned above. If a person
performs these duties, having an egoistic notion for enjoyment, ;
by having a selfish motive, he is bound. But if he performs these -
without expecting any reward, by giving up selfish motive and .
egoistic notion, it becomes ""Karmayoga"", and he is not bound. °
Through this Karmayoga (Discipline of Action), he worships ee
the Lord, who has manifested Himself, as the entire universe. If
one by surrendering himself to God, performs spiritual actions
(utterance of His name, meditation, good company and study -
of the scriptures etc.,) his actions turn into Bhaktiyoga, (The
Discipline of Devotion). Then his attachment (affinity to Prakrti
or Nature) is totally renounced, there remains nothing, but the -
Lord. Thus a striver realizes Him. Then all the actions with
his body, senses, mind and intellect are performed, according :
to his Varna (Caste), and Asrama (Stage of life), as sanctioned :
by scriptures and he is not attached to them. His actions are, .
models for others and his love for the Lord, Who is all-bliss,
enhances every moment. . |

Should one's Varna (Caste), be decided by birth or actions?
A being is born, as a man according to the qualities and actions .
of his previous birth. So his caste is decided by birth. Thus
marriages etc., should be decided by caste. Secondly, for a person
whose aim is to receive worldly pleasures, prosperity, luxuries,
honour and praise etc., it is obligatory to discharge his- duty,
according to his caste. If he does not do so, he has a downfall. |
Even the Vedas, abandon such a demoralized person, at the time

2002,"1952 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter18 — -
. of his death, even though he has studied, the six supplementary
branches of sacred sciences, (the Vedas) viz., education (Siksa),
ritual part-of. the Vedas (Kalpa), an exposition of the Vedangas
_ (Nirukta), metre (Chanda), grammar (Vyakarana) and astrology,
(Jyotisa). But, he whose aim is God-realization, practises chanting,
meditation, adoration, study of scriptures and performs, other
' _- spiritual activities, in order to attain his-aim. In the spiritual
- discipline, spiritual feelings and conduct, play a more important
role, than Varna or Caste. Thirdly, a striver, having the aim of
God-realization, attaching more importance to. spiritual activities,
performs his obligatory duty, according to his caste and stage .
of life, regarding it as worship to God. - :
_ Further, in the forty-sixth verse the Lord: explains, that |
He from whom all beings emanate and by whom all this is
pervaded—by worshipping Him through the performance of his ~
own duty, does man attain perfection. Every person, has got the
| right to perform his duty. The gods, demons, beasts and birds
do not possess this natural right, yet it is not forbidden to them, |
because being a fragment of God, they can attain Him. Every
being, can lay full claim, over the Lord. It proves, that there is -
predominance of feelings;..discrimination and action in_God- |
realization, while birth predominates in dealings, such as livelihood
and marriages etc. So, in the Bhagavata it is mentioned, that if
a man of a lower caste possesses the virtues of higher caste, he .
should be regarded noble, though he is born of a low womb.
Similarly, in the Mahabharata it is mentioned, in a dialogue
between Yudhisthira and Nahusa, that a Sidra, whose conduct
is noble, should not be regarded, as a Sidra and a Brahmana
who does not perform the duty of a Brahmana, should not be
regarded as, a Brahmana. It means, that there is predominance
of action, rather than birth. |
- Scriptures reveal, that even a man of the lowest caste, can
possess the virtues of the highest caste and progress spiritually.
So he need not get discouraged. Scriptures encourage a man |
of high caste to perform his duty, if he does not perform it. In
"
2003,"Verse 44] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI. 1953 :
Jurisprudence (Smrti), it is mentioned that Brahmanas, who eat -
forbidden food and who are immoral, should not be respected
even, by words. But scriptures declare, that a devotee of the -
Lord in spite of belonging to the lowest caste, is superiortoa |
learned Brahmana.* A Brahmana has been called, the voice of the. :
Lord's cosmic form. It means, that he has to impart knowledge
and teach and preach to the people of the four Varnas, with
words of mouth because he possesses knowledge. :
A Ksatriya, has been called an arm or hand of the Lord's
cosmic form, because it is he, who protects people of the four _ -
Varnas (Castes), from enemies. A hand protects the body from |
danger and serves it in sickness. Such is the duty of a Ksatriya.
In case of anarchy it becomes the duty of all four castes to_ |
protect their kith and kin, as well as their property. | :
A Vaisya, has been called the stomach of the Lord's cosmic _
form. As the stomach, receives and digests food and nourishes
ail the limbs, similarly, it is the duty of a Vaisya, to accumulate
commodities and to supply these to people, by transporting these :
_ from one place to another, according to the need and demand of
*(1) The low caste who chants the name of the Lord is noble. The noble 7
men who chant His name have performed.penances, oblations, pilgrimages, deeds
of virtuous conduct and have studied the’ scriptures (Srimadbha. 3/33/7).
(2) I hold that a low caste who has surrendered himself to God with
his mind, speech, actions, wealth and life-breath is superior to a Brahmana
endowed with twelve qualities who has a disinclination for the lotus-feet of |
Lord Visnu because the pariah sanctifies his family while the Brahmana having
a disinclination for the Lord because of the pride of his superiority complex
can't sanctify even himself (Srimadbha. 7/9/10). |
_ (3)The low caste who remains engrossed in devotion to God is superior
to a sage, while a Brahmana devoid of devotion to Lord Visnu is inferior to
a pariah because such a pariah with his kith and kin attains liberation from
‘the worldly bondage while that Brahmana is hurled into hells. .
(4) A low caste who is a devotee of Lord Visnu is superior to a Brahmana .
who is not a devotee of Lord Visnu because such a pariah with his kith and
kin attains liberation from the worldly bondage while such a Brahmana goes
to hells (Brahmavaivarta, Brahma. 11/39). ,
(5) If a Siidra is a devotee of God, he is not a Sidra, he is the noblest
Brahmana. In fact out of all the Varnas (Castes) a Sidra is he who is devoid
of devotion to God (Mahabharata).
"
2004,"1954 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 _
the people. It is he, who offers charity to Brahmanas, pays tax
to the Ksatriyas, brings himself up and remunerates, the Sidra

for his labour. By agriculture, trade and cow-rearing he supplies, —
the need of the four Varnas. 7 |

A Sidra, has been called the foot of the cosmic form of
the Lord. As feet carry the weight of the entire body, from one
place to another, a Sidra renders service, to the people of all |
four Varnas (Castes). =

These are the natural duties, of the persons. of four castes,
and involve no difficulty or exertion, for them. For duties, in ~
more detail, refer to the books on Jurisprudence (Smrti) and
follow those duties (Gita 16/24). . | -

Though at present the four Varnas (castes), are mixed, :
yet Brahmanas possess virtues, such as serenity, self-control
and austerity etc., more than people of the other three castes. Be
Similarly, heroism, vigour and firmness are specially found in
the Ksatriyas, while Vaigyas are more well-versed in agriculture, ;
cattle-rearing and trade, than the other three castes. In the same
way, a Sidra has more inclination to render service, than people
of other three castes. Thus the people of different castes, have -
a natural inclination, for their duties, which are born of their
nature, even today.

Some ignorant people, who have not studied the scriptures
seriously, blame the Brahmanas (persons of the priest class) that ""
they have established their superiority in writing the scriptures.

They hold, that the second position or place went to the Ksatriyas,
because of the authority and the third to the Vaisyas, as they
supplied the needs of the people. The people of these three castes, ;
trampled on the Sadras, out of selfishness and pride and asked

them to render service, to persons of the three castes.

The clarification is, that it is written nowhere that Brahmanas
are superior to the people of the other three castes, and so they
should lead a luxurious life. Their life is full of renunciation,
hardship and penance. Even in the household life, a Brahmana |
"
2005,"Verse 44} SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1955 -
should not accumulate wealth. He should not hoard grain more -
than a full jar and be not attached to mundane pleasures. He
should accept charity, only after performing his religious sacrifices,
oblations and other religious rites etc. If he accepts the gift of |
a cow, he should observe expiation. | -

When a Brahmana, is invited in order to offer water and food
etc., (as a 'Sraddha’) in honour of manes, the Brahmana invokes
the hosts’ manes, by observing continence and self-control. He
performs the rites of offering oblation, to the manes according |
to scriptural injunction. Then he takes a meal in the house of -
the host. Afterwards he recites a sacred formula of Gayatri |
(a mantra of the Rgveda, which is to be recited daily by the
twice-born), to purify himself. It is not something creditable, |
for a Brahmana to take a meal on the occasion of 'Sraddha’, or :
to accept charity. The credit. lies in his renunciation. He accepts _
the host's meal and gift, to enable the host's manes, to attain
emancipation, rather than for his selfish motive.

A Brahmana, can earn his living, by five means according
to Manusmrti (Code of Manu)*—_

(i) When crop is harvested, a few grains remain scattered -
here and there. A Brahmana picks these. Similarly, in the grain
market, where grain is weighed, grains scattered on the earth,
are picked by him. The former is known as 'Silofichavrtti', while,
the latter as 'Kapotavrtti’. This sort of livelihood, called ‘Rta’ is
regarded as the best for him. | |

(ii) If a host offers him a gift, without his request, it is
called 'Amrtavrtti’ or 'Ayacitavrtti'.

(ii1) Getting a gift as a reward, by explaining people of
auspicious time for marriage and other rites etc., is called :
Mrtavrtti.

(iv) Earning a living through, business is ‘Satyanrtavrttt'

* Rta, Amrta, Mrta, Pramrta and Satyanrta—these are the five means of
earmming a Brahmana's livelihood. He should never earn his living by rendering
service to others.
"
2006,"1956 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
(v) If he is unable to earn his livelihood by anyone of the :
above-mentioned means, he can earn it, by agriculture by following
the ordinance of scriptures, as he should not plough land with
one bullock, nor in scorching heat of the sun and so on. It is
called 'Pramrtavrtti’. He should eat food, after performing five ~
daily ceremonies, (the study of the scriptures, offering sacrifice
to gods, hospitality to guests, offering water to manes and casting .
of food, on ground for insects etc.).* — |
In the Gita, there is mention of nine natural duties of a |
Brahmana, and none of these is, for earning his livelihood. In the _
case of a Ksatriya, out of the seven natural duties, the two—war /
and lordliness, are partial means of earning his living. In the case -
of a Vaisya, all the three.:natural duties—agriculture, cattle-rearing .
and trade, are the means of earning a living. Similarly, is the }
case of a Sidra, whose only natural duty is service, which is a me
_ source of earning and for him there are not many restrictions,
on his food and source of livelihood.
The Lord, in the Gita, declares, ""Devoted to his own duty, ""
man attains perfection"" (Gita 18/45). It means that a sudra can
attain perfection, merely by service, a Vaisya, by agriculture, cow-
rearing and trade, a Ksatriya, by seven duties, such as heroism
and vigour etc., while a Brahmana, by performing nine duties,
such as serenity and self-control etc. .
Then He declares, ""By worshipping Him through the .
performance of his own duty, man attains perfection"" (Gita 18/
46). In fact, a man attains perfection by performing duty, as
worship to Him, without expecting reward. As far as rendering
service, is concemed, it is a sort of worship. So a sudra worships
God through service. Thus his worship is doubled. So he can ;
attain perfection, more easily than a Brahmana. Secondly the
responsibility fall on the eldest son, while the youngest receives
* It is forbidden for a Brahmana or a Ksatriya to earn his livelihood by
rendering service to others (Manusmrti 4/4, 4/6). But it does not mean that he |
should not render service to others. He should serve others even the Siidra.
But he should not earn his living by service.
"
2007,"Verse 44] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1957 .
the greatest love, without having any responsibility. Here, the -
eldest son is a Brahmana, while the youngest one, is a Sidra.

In fact, a man of a high caste, has to face difficulty in obeying =
scriptural injunctions thoroughly, and so he attains salvation with -
difficulty, while a man of lower caste attains Him easily. In this |
context, there is a story in the Visnu Purana. Once several sages
went to Vedavydsa, in order to know his decision about the
relative superiority of castes (Varna). Vedavyasa received them
cordially and went to take a bath in the Ganges. While bathing
he uttered three times ""Kaliyuga (Kali age), you are lucky;
Women, you are lucky; Sidras, you are lucky."" When he came .
back, the sages asked him how Kali age, women and Stidras were -
lucky. He answered, ""In the Kali age, women and Siidras by
performing their duties, can attain salvation quickly, and easily."" :

One more point needs attention here. A man who works Te
for his selfish motive, does not deserve respect either in the
family, or society. So, is the case with Brahmanas. They have
not praised themselves in the scriptures, in order to prove ;
their superiority. Noble men always praise and respect, other
people. Brahmanas are respected and praised, for their virtue -
of renunciation. So everyone, should give a serious thought to
this topic, and should not accuse saints, sages and Brahmanas,
who wrote the scriptures. °

The fourfold order, of society (viz., Brahmana, Ksatriya, ,
Vaisya and the stdra) was created, according to divisions of
quality and work (Gita 4/13). But even if a being, has to be born
in either a high womb, because of a boon etc., or low womb,
because of a curse etc., he acts according to the nature of the _
previous birth. It is because of this factor, that persons such as
Dhundhukari etc., in spite of being born in high wombs, perform
evil actions while persons, such as Vidura, Kabira and Raidasa
etc., in spite of being born, in low wombs perform virtuous deeds
and become great men. -

Today, we should try to get rid of personal and social evils, .
"
2008,"1958 _ §RIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
which are against ordinances of scriptures, by discrimination, good 7
company and study of scriptures. We should make our life pure
and holy, so that we may attain, the aim of human life. ;

Comment:—
""Sve sve karmanyabhiratah samsiddhim labhate narah'—A -
study of the Gita reveals, that a man's nature, may lead him
to salvation if he remains free from attachment and aversion,
as well as fruit of action. If a man performs his natural duties
scrupulously, without self-interest and attachment, the impetus
to action calms down, and he becomes detached from objects
and actions etc. So a striver, gets established in the self, which ;
is natural. Then, he is naturally attracted towards the Lord. A
man, should perform his duty promptly and enthusiastically,
for the welfare of others. By doing so, he experiences a sort of
pleasure, called, 'Abhirati’, for action. But if an act is done with
attachment, having an eye on its return—this is called 'Asakti’, 7
for action. The former leads him to perfection (salvation), while
the latter leads him to bondage.
In this context wn ‘Sve sve karmani', ‘Svakarmana
tamabhyarcya’, 'Svabhavaniyatarh karma’ and 'Sahajarh karma’
etc., the term 'Karma' (action) has been used, in singular number.
It means that if a man performs an action or several actions
"
2009,"Verse 45] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1959 -

promptly and enthusiastically, in order to realize God, and all |

his actions merge, in that aim of God-realization. It means, that

all of these are conducive to God-realization. The Ganges having |

risen in the Himalayas, flows to the Ganga-Sagara. On the way :

several streams, drains and small rivers, join it and they become

the Ganges. Similarly, all the actions of a person, whose aim is

to attain God, join that aim. But, he who is attached to action

and who has a desire for several rewards, by performing action |

or several actions, instead of God-realization, the intellect of

such an undecided person, is scattered in many directions, and is ~

endlessly diffused (Gita 2/41) and he cannot attain, perfection. -
‘Svakarmaniratah siddhim yatha vindati tacchrnu'—The

Lord, exhorts Arjuna to hear from Him and grasp properly, |

how a man, who is devoted to his duty, attains perfection

(God-realization). | ~
Even a servant, who is paid wages, renders service to his ;

master, even when his service is limited to actions and fixed

hours. But it cannot be called, real service. When a man considers ~

others venerable, either through birth, learning, caste or stage of

hfe, capability, status or virtues, he has only one central idea,

how they should get comfort, and how they should be pleased. .

To render service to them, according to their will and taste, for °

their pleasure is called, real service. The servant, in such service

has no self-interest and ego. He looks, only at the interest of the

people, he has to serve—this is real service. Real service involves

the feelings, of a devotee. His only aim is to please the Lord,

keeping in mind only His taste. The same service, if rendered

with hearty devotion, becomes adoration. Smearing the forehead

with sandalwood paste, offering flowers, garlanding and offering

of prayers, and praises and such other activities of devotion,

are included in adoration. When a devotee, either beholds his |

master, or the Lord, touches His feet, his body is thrilled, and
"
2010,"1960 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
he feels much delighted. When he is thrilled, there may be a bit
of slackness in his service to his master, (preceptor or the Lord),
but it purifies his heart and enables him to behold the Lord or
to realize Him: When, this devotion enhances, a devotee attains :
God-realization immediately. Such a devotee, always thinks how
to provide happiness and comfort, to his master, preceptor or
God, without thinking of his own happiness and comfort, at all. |
By doing so, he is highly. delighted. - a
All the activities of such a devotee, whether these are
performed, with his physical, subtle or causal body, become -
worship. of the Lord. Even his daily routine, and his eating, >
drinking etc., becomes the material for his worship...
Asa follower of the Discipline of Knowledge, always thinks, |
that he does nothing, similarly a staunch devotee worships, God
by performing several duties, only for God's sake, and in that -
state, his egoistic notion, is renounced.
Appendix—Besides the inherent duty according to one’s .
Varna (social order), whatever other duties have been accepted
by a man, all of them should also be included within ‘sve sve
karmani’. As a man adopts the profession of a lawyer, a servant, :
a teacher or a physician etc., the discharge of that duty justly
in a loving, respectful and selfless manner is also ‘svakarma’
(own duty) for him. oe
When a man performs an action with the sense of selfishness, /
partiality and desire etc., it is called “asakti’ (attachment). But
if he performs an action in a loving manner, without the desire
for fruit and for the welfare of others, it 1s called ‘abhirati’. The
Lord has negated ‘attachment’ in actions—‘na karmasvanusajjate’
(Gita 6/4). If a man has neither the superiority complex. nor the
inferiority complex, on the basis of his caste, but performs his
duty properly, just like the part of a machine (watch), and does
not blame and humiliate others, and is not proud of himself,
then it is ‘abhirati’. |
In fact an action (duty) is not important but it is the ‘attitude’
"
2011,"Verse 46] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1961 ~
which is predominant. If the doer of an action has the pure
feeling, it will lead him to salvation, though he may belong to
any ‘varna’. In performing an action there is predominance of
‘vara’ while in ‘feeling’ there is predominance of the divine ;
nature or the demoniac nature. Therefore all the people can be
endowed with the divine or the demoniac nature without the
distinction of ‘varna’. Divine nature leads to salvation and the |
demoniac nature is conducive to bondage. Therefore even if a
Brahmana is boastful of his hight. varna, he will be endowed
with the demoniac nature viz., he will have a downfall— 7

"
2012,"1962 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -

'Svakarmand4 tamabhyarcya'—According to Manusmrti (code
of Manu), the six duties of a ‘Brahmana, are—study, teaching, |
performance of religious sacrifice, performing it, for others as .
a priest, accepting charity and offering charity. Out of these, -
teaching, performing religious sacrifice for others as a priest, and |
accepting charity—these three are the means of his living, while
study, performance of religious sacrifice and offering charity, are
his duties. Through these six duties, as well as through the nine
duties mentioned in the verse forty-two of this chapter, and also
through other activities such as eating, drinking, going, sleeping ~
etc., he should worship, the Lord Who pervades all beings. It means, -
that he should serve all beings, regarding them as the manifestation
of the Lord, to please Him, without expecting any reward. |

Similarly, protection of subjects, offering charity, performance _
of religious sacrifice, study and detachment from sensual
pleasures—these five, are the duties of a Ksatriya, mentioned
in the code of Manu. A Ksatriya, through these five duties, and -
seven duties, mentioned in the forty-third verse of this chapter,
as well as through the activities of daily routine, such as eating, -
drinking etc., should worship the Lord, Who has manifested
himself, as beings.

A Vaisya, through religious sacrifice, study, offering charity,
charging interest, agriculture, cattle-rearing and trade, and all :
other activities, should worship the all-pervading Lord. Similarly,

a Siidra through service and all other activities, should worship |
the all-pervading Lord, without expecting any reward.

All the duties of men, mentioned in the scriptures, according
to their Varna (Caste or Social order) and asrama (stage of life), :
are meant, to worship the cosmic form of the Lord. If a striver,
while performing his activities, thinks that he is worshipping
the Lord, with his activities, all those activities are included
in the worship of the Lord. Grandfather Bhisma, on the battle-
field worshipped Lord Krsna, with arrows, through his duty of |
a warnor. With his arrows Lord Krsna's armour was broken, 7
"
2013,"Verse 46]. SADHAKA-SANJIVANI - 1963 .
He was injured and it became difficult for Him, to hold the -
bridle of the horse of the chariot. At the last moment of his life,
Bhisma thinks of the same Lord and concentrates his mind on
Him—""Let my mind and intellect, concentrate on Lord Krsna,
Whose armour was broken, with my sharp arrows, Whose body -
is injured, Whose face is adorned with perspiration, because of
exertion, and Whose beautiful curl, is stained with dust raised
by the gallop of horses."" : ;
A striver, should worship the Lord, through mundane and :
spiritual activities, but he should not be attached, either to the -
activities or the instruments and means, by which they are .
performed because attachment (a sense of mineness) makes :
things impure and polluted, and so they cannot be offered to >
God; they can’t be used for His worship. So a striver, should
think that whatever he possesses, belongs to the omnipresent —
Lord, and he as His instrument, has to worship Him with the
resources bestowed upon him, by Him. Thus all his activities,
become worship to the Lord, otherwise not. -
'Siddhim vindati manavah'—It means, that a person who
worships the Lord, through the performance of his own duty, -
by being free from his connection with Prakrti (Nature), gets
established, in the self. Then because of past influence, of his |
surrender to the Lord, his exclusive devotion to the Lord, is :
aroused. In that case, nothing further remains to be achieved by him.
Here, the term ‘Manavah' (man), stands not only for
Brahmanas, Ksatriyas, Vaisyas, Siidras, or for celibates, house-
holders, people of retired order, and renounced order, but also
for, all the people of different religions and sects etc., such as
Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Bauddhas, Parsees and Jews etc.
As a mother becomes pleased with the different activities, of her
sons, similarly the Lord is pleased, with the activities of men,
by regarding those activities as worship to Him.
Lord Krsna, in the seventieth verse of this chapter declares,
""He who studies this sacred dialogue of ours, by him, I shall
"
2014,"1964 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter18 7
_ be worshipped through the sacrifice of knowledge (wisdom), -
so I hold."" It shows that if a person studies the Gita, the Lord
| considers it, as His worship. Similarly, when a person, by having .
a disinclination for the perishable world, has an inclination for .
the Lord, He accepts it as worship, to Him. :
Through Karmayoga (the Discipline of Action), a devotee is |
detached from matter, while through Bhaktiyoga (the Discipline
of Devotion), he has an inclination for God. A Karmayogi, ~
serves the world with his body, senses, mind and intellect by -
abandoning his selfishness, pride and desire. By doing so, the -
flow of his actions is towards the world and the impetus to act,
calms down, his assumed attachment, to these things is renounced,
and his natural detachment, is revealed. ~
A devotee, following the Discipline of Devotion, worships
the Lord through the performance of his natural duties, as well
as, the spiritual duties, such as chanting His name, meditation and
adoration etc. Thus, he develops an inclination for God, having
a disinclination for Matter, and his love for Him enhances. -
A devotee, from the outset surrenders himself to God
exclusively. So all his mundane and spiritual activities, are
automatically surrendered to Him. Outwardly, mundane activities ,
seem different, from the spiritual ones, but actually, there is no
difference between the two.
At last, a Karmayogi and a Jnanayogi, also become one.
As a Karmayogi, becomes detached by serving the world,

through knowledge (wisdom), offer all his activities to prakrti
(nature) and become, detached.* Thus, both of them become
* It is inevitable for all the strivers whether they follow the Discipline
of Action or that of Knowledge or of Devotion to get detached from the world. |
In the Gita there is mention of this detachment for a Karmayogi in 5/11, for
a Jfia@nayogi in 18/26 and for a Bhaktiyogi in 11/55.

free from the bondage of actions. The actions of a Karmayogi, ~ ;
are dissolved entirely (Gita 4/23) while the fire of knowledge,
reduces all actions of a Jiianayogi, to ashes (Gita 4/37). Thus

he gets freedom. If he does not enjoy this freedom, he becomes ;
totally indifferent to this freedom. Then by God's grace, divine -
love can be revealed in him.

Appendix—Here the meaning of the term ‘pravrttih’ used
in the expression ‘yatah pravrttirbhutanarh’ should be taken as
‘origination’ (emanation) because all beings do originate from
God but actions do not emanate from God. An action (activity) -
emanates from the mode of passion—“‘lobhah pravrttirarambhah’ -
(Gita 14/12). The term “pravrtti’ in the fourth verse of the fifteenth |
chapter also has been used in the sense of origination—‘yatah
‘pravrttih prasrta purani’.

This universe is the first incarnation of God—‘adyo’ vatarah -
purusah parasya’ (Srimadbha. 2/6/41). Therefore this world is an
idol of God. As in an idol we worship God, we offer flowers, -
we apply sandalwood paste viz., we instead of worshipping the
idol, worship God; similarly we have to worship God in the
form of this world with each and every action of ours. The :
audience should worship the orator by listening to Him, the
orator should worship the listener by his speech or by his spiritual
discourse—thus all beings should worship one another through 7
the performance of their duty. They should have an eye on God
rather than on ‘varna’ such as Brahmana and Ksatriya etc. The
sages and saints did obeisance to Lord Rama by regarding Him
as God rather than a Ksatriya when he was sent into exile. The
important fact in worship is—all is God’s and it is only for Him.
As we worship the holy Ganges with the Ganges-water, similarly
we have to worship God with the things bestowed upon us by
Him. In fact performance of all actions is worship only to God,
we have to rectify our error of regarding it for us. Having offered
the God’s things to Him, our selfishness, pleasure-seeking nature,
and desire for fruit, will be wiped out; and having accepted our
"
2016,"1966 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
power (strength) as only God’s, our sense of doership will also :
be destroyed and we shall attain God.

The worship to the world by regarding it as the manifestation
of God, is highly prized than the worship to an idol of God. The .
reason is that if an idol of God is worshipped, the idol does not
appear to be pleased, but if service is rendered to beings, they
clearly appear to be pleased.

If human beings are served by regarding them as the
manifestation of God with actions and objects, the universe
will disappear and only God will remain viz., “All is God’—it -
will be realized, As in a rope when the illusion of a snake is -
wiped out, the snake ceases to be but the rope certainly remains;
similarly when in God, the illusion of the existence of the world |
is wiped out, then the world in the form of the world disappears,
and it remains as the manifestation of God. The reason is that -
the existence of the world is merely an assumption but ‘God
exists’—this is reality.

In Srimadbhagavata, the Lord declares—

naresvabhiksnam madbhavam pumso bhavayato’cirat
spardhasutyatiraskarah sahankara  viyanti hi ;
: (Srimadbha. 11/29/15)

“When a devotee regards all women and men as My
manifestation and he beholds Me in them*, then very quickly
evils such as envy, fault-finding, contempt etc., including egoism
are removed.”

The Lord in the Gita declares—‘ahamatma gudakesa
sarvabhutaSayasthitah’ (10/20)—“I am ‘the Self’ seated in the
hearts of all beings.” Therefore if we serve any being, respect
him, and greet him with pleasure and hospitality, by regarding
him as the manifestation of God, it will be service to God.

*The reason of beholding God in men and women is that we mostly
perceive virtues and vices in men and women, so we don’t perceive that they
are the manifestations of God. Therefore when we instead of perceiving virtues
and vices in them, will behold only God in all beings and objects, we’ll easily
regard them as the manifestations of God.
"
2017,"Verse 47] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1967 -
Similarly if we disrespect and humiliate any being, it will be
disrespect and humiliation to God only—‘karSayantah sdrirastharm
bhutagramama cetasah’ (17/6). ,
As in the path of knowledge, the modes are acting on the -
modes (“guna gunesu vartante’), similarly in the path of devotion,
God is being worshipped by God’s things. But there is a vast
difference between the two. In ‘guna gunesu vartante’ there is
predominance of matter (non-Self) which a striver, following the
path of knowledge, disowns but in ‘svakarmana tamabhyarcya’,
there is predominance of the sentient (the divinity) which the ~
striver, following the path of devotion, owns. Therefore in the -
path of devotion, inertness is wiped out, the universe in the
form of the universe is concealed, and it is revealed as God -
because in fact it is only God. If the universe appears as the
universe to a striver, he should serve it, and if it appears as the Oo |
manifestation of God, he should worship Him. He should do
nothing for himself. Performance of action for one’s own sake, :
is ‘bondage’; for the sake of the world, is ‘service’ and for
God’s sake, is ‘worship’.

"
2018,"1968 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 ”
Comment:— |
‘Sreyansvadharmo vigunah paradharmatsvanusthitat'— Here,
the term ‘Svadharma’, denotes one's duty according to one's
Varna (Caste): | -
A man, having an aim of God-realization, has to perform
his duty, according to what he thinks, himself to be. If he thinks
that he is a man, he has to perform his duty as a man. If he |
thinks that he is a teacher, or a student, he has to teach or study. |
Similarly if he holds, that he is a striver, a devotee, or a seeker
of knowledge, he has to practise spiritual discipline, devotion or -
seek knowledge, whole-heartedly. -
Similarly, a man has to perform his duty, according to his
varna (caste) and asrama (stage of life). A Brahmana's duties,
are—performance of religious sacrifice accepting charity, and _
teaching etc., in order to earn his living. For a Ksatriya, fighting
and authority, for a Vaisya agriculture, cow-rearing and trade,
and for a Sidra service, are the duties to earn their living. One's -
own duty, even though devoid of merit, is better than the duty
of others. The duties prescribed by the scriptures, for persons _
of a particular Varna, is 'Svadharma' (one's own duty), while
the same duty for people of other Varnas, castes is, Paradharma
(Duties of others). Performing religious sacrifice, for others as a
priest, and taking charity etc., are a Brahmana's own duties, as
these are sanctioned by scriptures for him, but the same duties |
are Paradharma, for the Ksatriyas, the Vaisyas and the Sidras,
as these are forbidden by scriptures, for them. But, at the time
of extreme distress, duties which are forbidden, by scriptures,
become duties, for people, of all varnas (castes). For example,
a Brahmana can earn his living by agriculture, and trade etc.,
which are duties of a Vaisya, at the time of extreme distress.*
*At the time of distress a Brahmana can earn his living through the
profession of a Ksatriya and at the time of extreme distress through the profession
of a VaisSya. But a Brahmana should plough the land with two bullocks instead :
of one and work in the field in the morning and evening when it is cool.
Moreover, he should not deal in sugar, butter, oil and salt etc. a
"
2019,"Verse 47] ~ SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1969 -

As far as the natural duties, such as serenity and self-
control etc., of a Brahmana, are concerned, these are duties,
for all members belonging to the four Varnas, because they are
prescribed by scriptures, for all of them. -

God-realization, is the only aim of human life. So every |
human being is a striver, therefore he has to cultivate all the
divine traits, in him by renouncing demoniac ones. Everyone
is free and strong, enough to abandon demoniac traits, and to |
develop divine ones. No one is dependent, weak and ineligible,
in it. According to their temperaments, different persons may -
possess different divine traits. A person may have predominance -
of forgiveness, in his nature, in another, person there may be
forgiveness only, on asking for it. In some other person, there
may be predominance of compassion, while in another there may -
be compassion, on thought. Such differences may exist.

‘Svabhavaniyatam karma’ kurvannapnoti  kilbisam'—In
scriptures, two kinds of actions, are mentioned—prescribed and -
prohibited. Out of the prescribed actions, those actions which
are performed according to one's caste (Varna), or stage of life ;
(Aérama) time, and circumstances etc., are called 'Niyata Karma’.

One's nature, is formed according to three modes of
nature—of goodness (sattva), of passion (rajasa) and of ignorance _
(tamasa). Actions which are performed according to that nature, _
are called ‘Svabhavaniyata Karma’. These are also known as
natural duties—duties born of nature, one's own duties and
innate duties etc.

A being is born, in a particular varna (caste) according to
qualities and actions, of his previous birth. Though actions perish,
but their impression (sarhskara) continues. So in life one is born
with that nature, which he inherits. The Lord (in Gita 18/48)
declares, that though all undertakings are tainted with blemish,
yet a person should perform his duty, according to his Varna

Similarly a Ksatriya can earn his living through the profession of a Vaisya
and a Vaisya through the profession of a Sidra.
"
2020,"1970 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 ,
(caste) as sanctioned in the scriptures, for the welfare of others,
by giving up his selfishness and pride. By doing so, he incurs
no sin. Similarly he, who performs actions, for the maintenance
of the body alone, incurs no sin (Gita 4/21). -
Now a doubt arises, whether a person born in the family of a |
butcher, should not abandon his duty of slaughtering animals? Does
a butcher not incur, sin? Can he attain salvation, by performing
such a forbidden action? | -
The explanation is, that natural duty is that which is not :
forbidden, and which is not harmful to anyone. The actions :
which are harmful or injurious to others, cannot be called, one's |
natural duties. These are performed out of attachment and desire. -
A forbidden action, is always evil and so it must be abandoned,
because it is a demoniac trait, while virtuous actions, are divine
traits. A man, may have a mere thought of committing evil, -
because of past impressions, but that thought cannot compel
him, to perform evil actions. That inclination, can be rooted -
out, through discrimination, virtuous thoughts, good company
and study of scriptures etc. Reasoning also reveals, that no one
wants to be injured and slaughtered. So none has a right to injure
and slaughter, others. If a person wants other persons to do good
to him, he should also do good, to others. The scriptures also
reveal, that any sin or unjust action, is not natural, it is born of
an evil. In the third chapter, Arjuna asked Lord Krsna, ""Impelled
by what does a4 man, commit sin, even involuntarily as though
driven by force?"" The Lord replied, ""It is desire, it is anger, born :
of the mode of passion, which impels a man to commit sins""
(3/36-37). Actions which are performed, out of desire, wrath,
selfishness, and pride, are not pure, but are impure.
Actions, which are performed, in order to attain God, are
not defective, even though they may be different, for people
of different castes. Having realized God, a Brahmana will
"
2021,"Verse 47] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1971 ~
observe purity and sanctity in the preparation of food, and
in having it. But a person of a low caste, having realized
God, will not observe purity and sanctity, hike a Brahmana. |
He will eat food which is left on the plate, after a meal while .
a Brahmana, will not eat it. So actions of the liberated souls,
are faultless. Their nature is pure, because they are free, from
either attachment or aversion. |

A man, is born in the family of a butcher, in order to reap the
fruit of his sinful actions. He is not born there, to commit sins.

In the YogadarSana (one of the six schools of Hindu philosophy), ~
sinful action bears fruit, in the form of caste, age and suffering, but :
it does not force that man to perform new sinful actions, (2/13).

He is free in performing actions. If his heart becomes pure, he -
cannot slaughter animals. A person, asked a saint, ""What should

a butcher, who considers slaughtering animals his profession, -
do?” The saint replied, ""If he goes on chanting the name of the

Lord, with sanctity, for three years, he will find himself unable .
to perform, his duty as a butcher. He will scorn his action and

then, he will give it up."" He will not be able to slaughter animals,

if he wants to realize God, from his heart, because his heart -
will change and virtues, will be revealed in him.

In the Ramacaritamanasa Lord Rama says, to Sabari, ""Listen
to the nine kinds of devotion which I am going to describe"" ;
(3/35/4). Afterwards He declared, ""You very well possess, all
kinds of devotion” (3/36/4). It means that Sabari did not know
the nine kinds, of devotion, though she possessed all of them.
Through adoration, meditation and good company, we develop
virtues, which we are not aware of. So a man, should make his
nature pure, and he is capable, of making it pure. He finds himself
incapable, because of his attachment to mundane pleasure and
prosperity. Those who hold discourses to preach others, can't
be virtuous, unless they themselves translate those preachings,
into practice, by making their nature pure, having the aim of :
God-realization.

no use of this human life, if a man cannot purify his nature. :
Appendix—By performing one’s own duty there can be sin ,

Comment:— -
[In the preceding verse, the Lord declared, "" He who performs |
his duty ordained by his own nature, incurs no sin."" It means that
duty ordained by one's own nature, also involves sin. Therefore,
the Lord declares, ""The natural duties, even though defective,
should not be abandoned, because all of these are clouded by .
defects, as fire by smoke.""]
‘Sahajam karma kaunteya sadosamapi na_tyajet'—The
duties ordained by one's own nature, are called innate duties.
A Brahmana's innate duties, are serenity and self-control etc.,
a Ksatriya's heroism and vigour etc., a Vaisya's agriculture and
cattle-rearing etc., and a Sudra's, service. |
"
2023,"Verse 48] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1973 oe
Duties ordained by one's own nature, have the following
defects: —
(1) God and the soul, His fragment, both are one's own (Sva),.
while Prakrti (Matter) and its evolute, body etc., are different _
(Para). But the self, a fragment of God, being overpowered by
Prakrti, becomes a slave to it. In other words, all activities are
taking place in nature. But, the self by assuming affinity with
Nature holds, that they are taking place in him. Thus, he becomes -
a slave to it. To be such a slave, is a great mistake.
(2) Every action involves violence, in one way or the other. -
(3) Action which is desirable to one, 1s undesirable to -
someone else. This undesirability, is a defect.
(4) An action may not be performed well, because of ;
heedlessness or error. Z
A person, should not abandon his innate duty, even though it
may be defective. For example, a Ksatriya's or a Vaisya's actions,
are not to be as virtuous and polite, as those of a Brahmana. -
But the Ksatriyas or the Vaisyas are not held responsible for
those defects and for violence, which their activities involve. _
They derive benefit by performing these, because these are
sanctioned by scriptures and are easily performed, as they suit
their temperament. -
Alms, is the means of a Brahmana’s livelihood. It may seem
free from any defect but it is not. Suppose a beggar is standing
at the door of a householder, and another comes there. He is a
burden on the householder. There can be jealousy between the
two beggars. If food materials are not ready, the householder feels
sorry. Suppose, a householder does not want to offer anything, so
he suffers pain, after seeing the beggar. If he offers something,
he has to incur expenses. But, if the beggar or Brahmana, returns
empty-handed, the householder incurs sin. So he gets entangled,
in a dilemma. Thus, though alms involve a blot, yet a Brahmana,
Should not abandon it. | :
A Ksatriya, has to kill warriors of the army of an enemy.
"
2024,"1974 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18
But he incurs no sin, because it is his innate duty, which is
prescribed by scriptures. Similarly, in agriculture, the duty of a
Vaisya involves, violence of several insects and germs. But a
Vaisya, incurs no sin, as it is his innate duty, which is sanctioned /
by scriptures. So innate duties, should not be abandoned.
Though men, by performing innate duties, incur no sin,
how will those duties, lead to salvation? In fact, these are evil
propensities, such as desire, attachment, selfishness and pride, |
which bind a man and because of which, a man incurs sin. So if
he performs duties for God's sake, by abandoning evil propensities, ~
without expecting any reward, he will not be bound. | -
""Sarvarambha hi dosena dhimenagnirivavrtah'—As, there
is smoke at the beginning, when fire is burnt, similarly, all -
undertakings are enveloped by defects, as their performance _
depends on incidents, circumstances and occasions etc., and these
may be undesirable for others. So, a man who performs these
duties without expecting any reward, incurs no sin. Therefore, the -
Lord is saying to Arjuna, ""Brother! It is thy duty, to wage war,
which you regard as dreadful, for there is nothing more welcome,
for a man of the warrior class, than a righteous war"" (Gita 2/31).
Appendix—Because of the attachment to forbidden actions or
because of the enjoyment of pleasure against the ordinance of the
scripture, performance of actions, sanctioned by the scriptures,
seems difficult. In fact actions sanctioned by the scriptures are
innate and natural, they need no labour. From the forty-first
verse upto this verse the terms ‘svakarma’, ‘svadharma’ and
‘sahaja karma’ have been used. It proves that the Gita regards
‘svakarma’ (one’s own duty), ‘sahaja karma’ (innate duty) as 7
‘svadharma’ (one’s own duty). |
Actions which are sanctioned by the scriptures, are certainly
tainted with blemish; but if a striver has no desire, he does not
hanker after pleasures, then he is not tainted with blemish. It means
that whether the doer is tainted with blemish or not, depends on
his intention; as—if a surgeon has good intention, wants to serve
"
2025,"Verse 49] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1975 -

the patient rather than to earn money, while performing a surgical

operation, he cuts the part of the patient’s body, yet he is not

tainted with blemish, but his act is regarded as virtuous because

he performs the operation selflessly for the good of the patient. ;

He, whose intellect is unattached alround, who has subdued ~
his body, and from whom desire has fled—he, attains the supreme
state of non-action, through Sankhyayoga, (the Discipline of
Knowledge). 49 :
Comment:—

Sannyasa (Sankhyayoga), is the means to attain, the supreme ”
state. Now, the Lord describes the three factors in the first half
of the verse which enable a man to practise Sankhyayoga (the
Discipline of Knowledge). : -

(1) '‘Asaktabuddhih sarvatra'—His intellect remains unattached,
to incidents, circumstances, things, actions and persons etc.

(2) 'Jitatma'—He has conquered his body 1.e., he is not
overpowered by heedlessness and indolence etc., rather he
overpowers these. He performs prescribed duties promptly, and
abstains from forbidden actions.

(3) 'Vigatasprhah'—He has no subtle desire, even to get the
bare necessities of life, such as water, food, clothes and shelter.

He is satisfied with, whatsoever, he gets.

It means that a striver, who wants to follow the Discipline :

of Knowledge (Sankhyayoga), has to renounce his attachment
"
2026,"1976 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 :
to matter and then he 1s endowed with, the above-mentioned,

three qualities. If he is unattached, his body, senses and mind

are subdued, and when these are subdued, he becomes free, from |
desire. Then, he becomes qualified to practise Sankhyayoga, (The |
Discipline of Knowledge). Oo

‘Naiskarmyasiddhirn paramam sannyasenadhigacchati'—Such a
man, whose intellect is unattached, everywhere, who has subdued
his self, from whom desire has fled—he by Sankhyayoga, attains
the supreme state viz., God-realization. The reason is, that actions
take place in prakrti (matter), not in the self. When a striver ~
(the self), has not the least attachment for that action, the action :

- or its fruit, does not affect him at all. So the natural state of
detachment, and actionlessness, is revealed. :

Appendix—‘Naiskarmyasiddhi’ means that an action should -
become totally inaction, there should not remain the least affinity
with action; while performing an action; the striver should remain
untainted (detached)—‘karmanyakarma yah pasyedakarmani ca .
karma yah’ (Gita 4/18). Non-performance of actions is not
‘naiskarmya’ (actionlessness) (Gita 3/4), but it is necessary for ;
a striver to perform action (Gita 6/3).

“Asaktabuddhih sarvatra jitatma vigatasprhah’—This is
attainment of perfection (peace) by Karmayoga (Gita 2/71), having
attained which a Karmayogi follows the path of knowledge (Gita
5/6) and attains the state of actionlessness by this path. In this way
by Karmayoga, only actionlessness (naiskarmyasiddhi) is attained
(the striver becomes free from the bondage of action) (Gita 3/4)
but by devotion he attains the supreme state of actionlessness
(parama naiskarmyasiddhi). Karmayoga and Jnanayoga are the
paths (nisthas)}—‘loke’ smindvividha nistha’ (3/3) but the supreme
state (para nistha) of Karmayoga-Jianayoga will be attained only
by devotion—‘nistha jhanasya ya para’ (18/50). It means that
both ‘parama naiskarmyasiddhi’ and ‘para nistha’—both are
attained only by devotion.

Know from Me, in brief, O Arjuna, how he, who has

Brahma (the Eternal or the Absolute), that supreme state of -
knowledge (jiiana). 50 -
Comment:— : ,

‘Siddhirh prapto yatha brahma tathapnoti nibodha me'—Here,
the term ‘Siddhim' (perfection), denotes purification of the ~
inner sense (viz., mind and heart), which was discussed in the
preceding verse, by the expressions ‘Asaktabuddhih’ (unattached
intellect), ‘Jitatma’ (subdued body) .and 'vigatasprhah' (freedom :
from desires). Such a person, whose inner sense is purified, has
no desire or attachment for anything, circumstance, or person. -
Nothing, remains to be achieved by him. So it has been said,
that he has attained perfection.

A worldly person, thinks that he has attained perfection, if :
his desires are satisfied, and he has attained accomplishments
(Siddhis), such as anima (that which makes a Yogt infinitely
small and invisible) etc. But in fact, this is not perfection,
because satisfaction (fulfilment), of one desire, gives birth to
other desires. These desires prolong and they bind him. Real
perfection, consists in total freedom, from desires.

A striver, who has attained perfection in the form of
purification of the inner sense, attains Brahma. Lord Krsna,
exhorts Arjuna, to hear from Him of the important factors, in
brief, because these are indispensable for a striver, who wants :
to practise, the Sankhyayoga.
"
2028,"1978 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 ,
The term 'nibodha' (Know), denotes that in the Discipline
of Knowledge, action and material, are not so important, as Is
knowledge. So the term 'Nibodha,' has been used here, as well
as in the thirteenth verse of this chapter, in connection with a
‘Sankhyayoegr. |
‘Samasenaiva kaunteya nistha jfidnasya ya para'— ‘Paranistha’,
is the final stage of Sankhyayoga (the Discipline of Knowledge).
Lord Krsna asks Arjuna, to know after hearing from Him in brief, -
how a striver following the path of Knowledge, attains Brahma
(the Eternal), that supreme state of knowledge. -
Appendix—Here the term ‘siddhim’ means complete -
purification of the inner sense, having attained which a
Karmayogi can follow either the Path of Knowledge or the -
Path of Devotion—
tavat karmani kurvita na _ nirvidyeta yavata

“‘Actions should be performed by the time, there is detachment
(dispassion) from mundane pleasures or until there is faith in ;
listening to My pastime and divine strories and in their loud
chanting etc.”
If a striver does not insist on anyone of the three disciplines
of Karma, Jiana and Bhakti, then these are the ‘means’ as well
as the ‘end’. As means, these three are different but as an end
all the three are one. Therefore in the Gita, the Lord in certain
references declared devotion as a means to achieve an end
which is knowledge (Self-realization)—‘mayi cananyayogena
bhaktiravyabhicarin’ (13/10), ‘mam ca yo’vyabhicarena.....

He declared Jnana as a means to achieve Bhakti which is an
end—‘sanniyamyendriyagramam sarvatra........sarvabhuta hite

man, becomes qualified to attain Brahma. 51—53 .
Comment:— |

'‘Buddhya visuddhaya yuktah'—A striver of Sankhyayoga,
who wants to realize God, should be endowed with a pure or /
Sattviki intellect, (Gita 18/30). There should be no doubt in |
this intellect. In the Discipline of ‘Sankhya’, buddhi' (intellect),
is given priority. Discrimination, which is very essential for a
striver, is revealed in pure intellect. It is by this discrimination, ;
that he severs his connection with matter.

'Vairagyam samupasritah'—As worldly people depend, on ~
objects and persons, out of attachment or passion, a striver, :
of Sankhyayoga, remains detached. He has no attachment for
worldly persons, and places etc., worldly and celestial pleasures, -
have no charm for him. |

'Viviktasevi'—Such a striver, has a natural inclination to live
in solitude.This inclination is, praiseworthy. But if a striver, does
not get such an opportunity to live in solitude, he should not be
perturbed. This perturbation, shows the importance of worldly
things, in his mind. This importance, causes further perturbation
of the mind, which is an obstacle to meditation. He shouldremain — ©
equanimous, both in solitude, and at a crowded place.

Solitude, is conducive to concentration, meditation and
purification, of heart. But, it also provides a good opportunity ;
to drowsiness and relaxation. Moreover, a striver derives pleasure,
out of praise and honour, won through his residence in a lonely
place. These are stumbling blocks, to the progress of a striver.

So, he should be on guard, against them.

'Laghvasi'—A striver, should take regulated diet. He should
eat, those articles of food, which suits his body. Moreover, he
should not take too much food, he should eat, as much as, 1s
indispensable for the body. It should not be taken to nourish
the body, but only to satisfy hunger, like medicine. He should
take such food as is easily digestible and is suitable for spiritual
practice. It should also be pure or Sattvika.
"
2031,"Verse 51—53] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1981 -
'‘Dhrtydtmanam niyamya ca'—He should firmly restrain, the oe

intellect from worldly temptations, and should not allow it to

deviate from the aim of God-realization. By such unswerving or

Sattvika firmness, (Gita 18/33) he should control his senses, and

should not let them run after worldly enjoyments, any time. |
""Yatavakkayamanasah'—He should control his body, speech

and mind (Gita 17/14—16). He should not indulge his body, in

any futile pursuit, such as lottering here and there, and journey, -

for pleasure etc. His speech, should be truthful, agreeable and °

necessary, free from reproach and scandal etc. The mind, should be _

utilized, in the thought of the Lord, rather than of the world. o
Sabdadinvisayarnstyaktva'—A striver, should withdraw the ;

senses of sound, touch, form (sight), taste and smell from their -

respective objects, because a striver whose senses are not turned

away from their objects, cannot practise meditation. If he enjoys 7

sense-objects, in an attached spirit, he will dwell on sense-objects,

during meditation, and he will not be able to meditate. ;
""Ragadvesau vyudasya ca'—A man, is attached to persons and

things regarding these, as useful for him. If anyone creates an

obstacle to the attainment of any worldly object, he automatically -

hates him. If he is attached to something desirable, he has an

automatic aversion, to the undesirable one. A man, is bound both

by attachment and aversion, because he goes on thinking of the ”

two. So, he should cast aside attraction (attachment), and aversion.
'Dhydnayogaparo nityam'—A striver, should be ever engaged

in meditation, and concentration. During fixed hour of meditation,

he should practise meditation, while during the time he discharges

his professional and other practical duties, he should believe that

nothing else exists, besides, the Lord (Gita 18/20).
‘Ahankaram balam darpam kamam krodham parigraham

vimucya'—A person, has egoistic notion, by regarding himself

as superior to others, because of his virtues. It is called

‘Ahankara’. The force to bring others under one's sway in a

wrongful manner, is called ‘bala’ (power). Vain consciousness, of
"
2032,"———-:1982 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 .
one's property and riches etc., is known as 'Darpa’ (arrogance). |
The desire for obtaining worldly pleasures, prosperity and
favourable circumstances, is 'Kama'. The feeling of excitement |
or provocation, (a kind of hot sensation) to do wrong to others,
because these have been a stumbling block to our selfishness,
and pride is ‘Krodha’ (anger). Covetousness and accumulation
of things and objects, for enjoyment, is ‘Parigraha’.* A striver,
abandons the above-mentioned egoism, force, arrogance, desire, -
anger and covetousness. |

'Nirmamah'—'Nirmamah’, is he who renounces a notion of -
mineness, in things, body, mind and senses etc. In fact, things,
persons and our so-called bodies, were not ours, a hundred years :
ago and will not remain ours, after a hundred years. We can
assume the persons as ours, in order to serve them, and we can -
make the right use of the things, but it is wrong to regard these -
as ours, forever. If we do not regard these as ours, we become
free, from the notion of mineness.

‘Santah'—Tranquillity of mind, is disturbed by assuming :
affinity with, the world. If this affinity is renounced, a striver,
will remain tranquil in mind, because attachment or aversion, -
disturbs peace of mind. —

'Brahmabhiyaya kalpate'—A striver, who is devoid of the
notion of mineness, and is tranquil in mind, becomes qualified
to attain Brahma i.e., as soon as his affinity with the unreal, is
renounced, he becomes worthy of attaining, Brahma. The reason
is, that this affinity with the unreal, is an obstacle, to attainment
of Brahma viz., God-realization. |

Link:-The Lord in the next verse explains the marks of
such a striver who becomes qualified to attain Brahma and also

* A celibate, a person of the retired order (Vanaprastha), and a man of
the renounced order (Sanny4st) must not accumulate objects and things. If a
householder accumulates objects and money etc., to render service to others, |
that is also not 'Parigraha’.
"
2033,"Verse 54] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1983 .
points out what he attains further. : .
AAA: WAATAT A Viretfer A SHTSaria
aa: aay yay Wek AVA WAU I |
brahmabhitah prasannatma na Socati na kanksati |
samah sarvesu bhutesu madbhaktim labhate param
Having become one with Brahma, and being tranquil (cheerful) ~
in mind, he neither grieves nor desires, and regards all beings as
alike, he acquires supreme devotion for Me. 54 -
Comment:—
'‘Brahmabhitah'—When, mind does not attach importance to
the perishable, its evil propensities, such as egoism and pride, -
etc., are renounced. Then man has no feeling of 'mine’, for them.
Then, he does not accumulate or hoard things, for pleasure. When, OO
he is not attached to pleasure and prosperity etc., naturally the
mind becomes tranquil. |
Thus, when a striver transcends the unreal, he becomes
qualified to attain Brahma. Then from his point of view he
becomes, one with Brahma and he realizes this fact, that he is -
Brahma. This state is called 'Brahmabhutah' here and in 5/24.
'‘Prasannatma'—When mind attaches importance, to unreal
things, man desires to obtain those things. This desire, disturbs
peace of mind. But, when importance is not attached to unreal
things, a striver's mind, remains calm and cheerful. The reason
is, that in the eyes of such a Yogi, the world ceases to exist,
only Brahma exists.
'Na Socati na kanksati'—Such a Yogi, who has attained |
oneness with Brahma, does not grieve at the heaviest loss, nor
does he crave for favourable circumstances. It means, that he
remains unruffled in perishable circumstances, because he does
not behold anything, other than Brahma.
‘Samah sarvesu bhiitesu'—So long as, a striver does not |
become free, from the pairs of opposites, such as pleasure and
"
2034,"1984 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18
pain, attachment and aversion etc., he cannot realize his identity,

with God. Without realizing his identity with Him, he cannot
regard, all beings as alike. But, as soon as, he becomes free from

the pairs of opposites, he realizes his oneness, with God. Then, |
he has no separate personality or existence of his own,* and he |
becomes one, with Him. Thus, he regards all beings as alike, in

the same way, as the Lord is alike to all beings (Gita 9/29). As

in a dream, everything is created by the mind, there is nothing :
except mind. The mind exists 1n creation and creation exists,

in the mind. Similarly, God as Self, abides in all beings, and ~
all beings, exist in the Self (God) (Gita 6/29). This is, what the -
Lord means, by ‘Samah sarvesu bhitesu’.

_ 'Madbhaktim labhate param'—When a Yogt having realized -
his identity with God, regards all beings alike, he has a unique
attraction, towards God and it enhances every. moment. That -
attraction has been called here 'Parabhakti’, (Supreme devotion). |

As, in-the twenty-fourth verse of the fifth chapter, there _
is mention that a Sankhyayogi, identified with Brahma, attains
Brahma Who is all Peace, similarly, a Yogi having realized his
identity with Brahma, attains supreme devotion, to Him. -

Appendix—tThe striver; who follows the Path of Knowledge,
has latencies of devotion, does not insist on his opinion, does not
regard salvation the ultimate end, does not refute and censure
devotion, he is not satisfied with the attainment of salvation.
Therefore having attained salvation, he also attains devotion (love).

He who from his viewpoint holds that he is Brahma,
though actually he has not attained Brahma, for him the term
‘brahmabhutah’ has been used. Being ‘brahmabhuta’ the Self
becomes identical in attributes with Brahma viz., he enters into
the Lord’s Being—‘mama sadharmyamagatah’ (Gita 14/2). To
be identical in attributes with Brahma is salvation. Then he
merges (surrenders) himself in the all-pervading Lord of infinite
universes, the Supreme Soul and becomes verily the Lord’s own |

* When a man accepts his separate existence, it leads him to bondage.
"
2035,"Verse 55] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1985 .
Self (inseparable with Him)—‘jiani tvatmaiva me matam’ (Gita
7/18). This intimate relationship in which the devotee becomes
the Lord’s own self viz., inseparable with Him, is the attainment |
of ‘para bhakti’ (love which increases every moment).

In the Path of Knowledge, renunciation of matter is important :
which is done by discrimination. When the matter is renounced
in the light of discrimination, the objects renounced may leave
their latent impression, which causes philosophical differences of ;
opinions. But having attained love, there is no latent impression
of the objects renounced, because a devotee renounces nothing ~ ~
but he regards all objects and beings etc., as the manifestation |
of God—‘sadasaccaham’ (Gita 9/19). Love is not attained by the
use of discrimination but is attained by faith. In faith there is -
dependence only on God’s grace. Therefore the striver who has
the latent impression of devotion, the God’s grace, does not let . -
him be satisfied with salvation, the relish of salvation (integral
relish) becomes insipid for him and by God’s grace the relish
of love (infinite relish) is bestowed upon him. :

The affinity with the world causes disquietude; therefore by
Karmayoga, with the breach of affinity with the world, “serene -
bliss’ is attained. By Jnanayoga a striver by getting established
in the Self, attains Bliss of the Self. In Bhaktiyoga by becoming
one with God, the devotee attains the Supreme Bliss viz., infinite :
Bliss (love which enhances every moment). |

merges unto Me. 55

Comment:—

""Bhaktya mamabhijanati'—When a striver, 1s attracted towards -
God, he surrenders himself to Him and becomes one with Him. |
He, has no separate existence of his own, his egoism, in its
subtle form also disappears. He attains supreme devotion, and -
then he knows God, in truth.

When he realizes his identity with God, his affinity with the
world is renounced, but he has egoistic thoughts, in its subtle -
form, by thinking, ""I am Brahma, I am tranquil, I am free, -
from modifications.” Because of this subtle egoistic notion, his
individuality and dependence persist, because egoistic thought -
is an evolute of prakrti (nature) and prakrti is different, from .
the self. This egoism perishes after attaining supreme devotion.

As soon as, this egoism completely perishes, he knows God,

in truth. : | _
_ 'Y€van'—At the beginning of the seventh chapter, the blessed

Lord said to Arjuna, ""Listen how, practising Yoga, with mind ;

attached to Me, with complete dependence on Me, thou shalt

know Me, in full, without any doubt."" The same fact, was pointed

out, at the end of the seventh chapter, when He declared, ""Those

who, having taken refuge in Me, strive for deliverance from old :

age and death, know Brahma (the Absolute), Adhyatma (the entire

self), entire field of action (i.e., they know Him as attributeless)

and also My integral being, comprising Adhibhuta (material field),

Adhidaiva (Brahma) and Adhiyajna (the unmanifest Divinity

dwelling in the hearts of all beings as their witness) (i.e., they |

know Him endowed with attributes).""

Besides knowing Him, as attributeless and endowed with
attributes, they also know Him in His other forms, such as Rama,
Krsna, Siva, Ganega and Sun etc. Thus he knows what He is.

'YaScasmi tattvatah'—A devotee, comes to know, that God
is one, but He manifests Himself in different forms, again and
"
2037,"Verse 55] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1987 .
again, according to the feelings of devotees. Thus, though a
devotee calls a particular form of the Lord, his favourite Deity,

He is one and the same in all the different forms.

""Tato mar tattvato jiiatva visate tadanantaram'—Having |
known the Lord in reality he immediately enters into Him Le.,

attains Him and knows the truth, about Him. This is perfection,

and this is, the fruitfulness of human life.

A man (soul), is automatically attracted towards God. But, _
when he assumes his affinity with prakrti (matter), he is disinclined .
from God, and is inclined to the world. Then this very attraction :
is called lust, desire, hope or ambition etc. |

The thing that is desired, is perishable and kaleidoscopic, while
the self is, eternal and unchanging. But he by identifying himself -
with prakrti, is attracted towards the changeable. This attraction
or attachment, leads him to the cycle of birth and death. But, if
he practises anyone of the disciplines of Action, Knowledge or -
Devotion, he can be free, from this cycle of birth and death. If
serious thought is given to these three disciplines, it is found, that -
in all the three, there is devotion for God. In the Discipline of
Action, there is devotion to duty (18/45). (This devotion to duty,
is at last changed into devotion to the self (2/55, 3/17) and in the .
case of a man, who has past impressions (sarhskara) of devotion
for God, his devotion to duty, is transformed, into his devotion
for God.) In the Discipline of Knowledge, this devotion is to
the self (5/24) and in the Discipline of Devotion, this devotion
is for God (10/9).* Though in all the three disciplines, there is
devotion to duty or self or God but in Gita devotion for God, 7
has been specially glorified. |

* When a man regards a thing as his own, he is automatically attracted
towards it. God has been ours, since time immemorial. If we realize this fact,
we shall be automatically attracted, towards Him. That attraction will provide
etemal and unique bliss to us. Then, we shall be free from all evil propensities,
such as desire, anger, greed, pride and envy etc. All evils are born, because
spiritual bliss, has not been attained.
"
2038,"1988 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter18

A Yogi (who is equanimous), is superior to ascetics, men .
of knowledge and men of rituals (Gita 6/46). It means, that a
Yogi, who has links with prakrti (matter), in spite of observing
austerities, possessing knowledge of scriptures and performing
Vedic rituals, such as holy sacrifice, offering charity and going |
on pilgrimages, etc., receives a perishable reward, while a Yogi,
attains spiritual realization. Therefore, he is superior to the other
three. The Lord, further points out, that even among Yogis, the -
greatest is a devotee (bhakta), (Gita 6/47). In this context, a
Bhaktiyogi, knows Him fully. A Sankhyayogi, through supreme _
devotion, knows Him, fully. The same description of His full |
form is represented by the term, ""Yavan.’”*

At the beginning of this topic, the Lord promised to explain,
how a man endowed with pure intellect, attains Brahma. He
explained, that a striver engaged in meditation and concentration, ~
resorts to dispassion. Then, being free from egoism and mineness,
he attains tranquillity. One, who is tranquil in mind, becomes
qualified to attain Brahma. In that state, the pairs of opposites, -
such as attachment and aversion, pleasure and pain, born of
his affinity with the world, totally perish. Then, he regards, all .
beings alike and afterwards that he attains, supreme devotion.

A man (the soul), has developed a disinclination for God, by having
attachment for perishable things and persons etc. But, still he has an inclination
for Him, as in distress and adversity, he invokes Him for help and protection.

* The term 'Yavan' (what He is) has been explained, in 7/19 with the
declaration ‘All this is God.' The same eternal Lord has been explained by
distinguishing the real from the unreal, higher and lower natures, spirit (sou!)
and nature (Prakrti), the knower of the field and the field and also beyond the
real and the unreal (11/37). The same eternal Lord, has been explained giving
three forms—higher, lower natures and 'T' (7/5-6), the knower of the field,
the field and 'Me' (13/1-2), the imperishable, the perishable and the Supreme
Person (15/16-17). Again each of these three, has been divided into two—lower
nature, into actions and things, higher nature into spirit and Brahma (the creator)
and ‘I’ into attributeless, and endowed with attributes.

It can be explained by an illustration. Water can have six different
forms—atom as attributeless Brahma, vapour as God with attributes, cloud as
Brahma, drops as common embodied soul, rain as action of creation and ice
as element (earth, air, water and fire etc.).
"
2039,"Verse 55] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1989 .
That supreme devotion, is true love. Through that supreme -
devotion or true love, he knows Brahma fully and forthwith
enters into Him.
A striver, through exclusive devotion can know Him ine
essence, can see Him, and can even, enter into Him (Gita 11/54)
while a Sankhyayogi, can know Brahma in essence, can enter
into Him, but the Lord is not bound to reveal His vision before
Him, because he has no desire to behold Him. But it does not -
mean that he is in anyway inferior to the striver who through
exclusive devotion can behold Him. =
Here, entrance into Him, is that attachment to love which :
is inexpressible and which is said to enhance, every moment.*.
This love, is the state of perfection, in which nothing remains -
to be known, nothing remains to be done, and nothing further
to be achieved. So, such a Yogi, has neither attachment for -
action, nor curiosity to know, or hope to live, or fear to die,
nor greed, to receive. -
Until he attains supreme devotion even having become one
with Brahma, he possesses, a subtle egoistic notion, that he is
Brahma. But this notion does not lead him, to the cycle of birth 7
and death, unless he is attached to modes of nature. Attachment
to the modes, is the cause of his birth, in good and evil wombs
(Gita 13/21). For example, when a man awakes from sound '
sleep, first of all he thinks 'I am’. Through this thought he is
attached to his name, form, caste, place and time etc. This egoistic
notion, becomes the cause of his good and evil actions. Thus, he
follows a cycle of birth and death. But, when he attains supreme
devotion, this subtle egoistic notion, is renounced. A striver,
of high rank, who has become one with Brahma, sees the one
Imperishable Being, in all existence (18/20). But, so long as,
he has affinity with the mode of goodness, after awaking from
sleep, he thinks 'I am Brahma’ or 'All is God’. It means, that
*This love is free from attributes and desires, it enhances every moment,
it cannot be divided, it is the subtlest and it can only be experienced.
"
2040,"1990 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
during sleep, he forgets. this fact and he remembers it, when
he awakes. When he transcends, the three modes of nature, he
realizes, that he is free from the state of sleep and wakefulness,
because both of these take place in nature, while he (the self)

ever remains, the same. So, such a liberated soul, is neither
attached to illumination (wakefulness) and delusion (sleep), nor

has an aversion, for them (14/22).

Appendix—‘What (as much) I am and who I am’ (yavan ”
yascasmi1)—this statement pertains only to God endowed
with attributes because ‘yavan-tavan’ cannot be applicable to ~
attributeless Brahma, it can be applicable only to God endowed
with attributes. In “catuhsloki’ (consisting of four verses) Bhagavata
also the Lord while using the term ‘yavan’ said to Brahma— .

yavanaham yathabhavo yadripagunakarmakah
tathaiva tattva vijianamastu te madanugrahat .
(Stimadbhi. 2/9/31)

“As much I am, of what feeling I am, of what forms, -
attributes (qualities) and actions I am; by My grace you should
exactly realize the reality of My entire form as it is.”

The expression ‘yavan yascasmi’ has been described by :
the Lord in the thirtieth verse of the seventh chapter by the
expression ‘sadhibhutadhidaivam mat sadhiyajnazhn ca ye
viduh’. It proves the speciality and significance of God endowed
with attributes.

The striver following the Path of Knowledge, after Self-
realization, attains devotion, then he knows Brahma in essence and
also enters into Him, but he does not behold Him; nothing lacks
in him but he has no desire for God’s vision while the striver
who follows the path of devotion from the beginning, knows God
in essence, enters into Him and also beholds Him (Gita 11/54).
Therefore when there is mention of the saints who followed
the Path of Knowledge, it is said that they loved God viz., had
devotion to Him but there is no mention that they beheld Him.

As people coming by different paths, having entered the
"
2041,"Verse 56] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 1991 -

gate, meet together, so do the strivers following different spiritual :

paths, having entered into God, become one viz., without having

even the subtle trace of ego, they become free from differences

of opinions. |
There are two states of love—{1) When a devotee is engrossed |

in love, then the lover and the beloved don’t remain two but they

become one. (2) Sometimes in a devotee there is an overflow

of love, then the lover and the beloved in spite of being one, :

become two in order to stage the drama of human life. Here the

term ‘visate’ has been used to indicate the first state. ~

Comment:— |
‘Madvyapasrayah'—Such a devotee, instead of depending
"
2042,"1992 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 ~
on actions, their fruits, incidents, things and persons etc., and
surrendering himself to Him, depends only on Him. He does not
regard anything or person, as his own. Such a devotee, has to
make no effort to be free from the bondage, of cycle of birth .
and death. The Lord Himself, straightway rescues him, from
the ocean of birth and death (Gita 12/7). One has not to worry
about his living or spiritual progress. The Lord, takes over full
responsibility to attend to his needs (Gita 9/22). According to -
His rule, even the vilest sinner by taking refuge in Him, not
only satisfies the needs of life, but also attains the supreme goal ~
(Gita 9/30—32). -
'‘Sarvakarmanyapi sada kurvanah'—The Lord, by using the
term 'Sarva' with 'Karman1', and the term 'Sada', with 'Kurvanah’, -
means to say that the state which is attained, by a meditative
Sankhyayogi, through meditation by controlling his body, speech. -
and mind, is attained by a Karmayogi devotee, while performing
mundane, social, physical and spiritual actions, on having taken -
refuge, in Him by His grace. |
Generally, people think that a devotee living in solitude and
engaged in devotion, adoration and meditation, attains salvation. :
But how can a man, who is ever engaged in activities, like
a machine, attain salvation? The Lord, clarifies the doubt, by
announcing ""Matprasadat (by My grace)"". It means, that he who :
has taken refuge in Him, attains salvation by His grace. Who
can check Him from blessing His devotee with beatitude?
The Lord, regards every human being, as His own and so
the Divine grace is axiomatic, and is always showered. But, so
long as, a man depends on the world, having a disinclination
for God, His grace, does not bear fruit, for him. But, as soon —
as, he starts giving up his dependence on the world, he starts
feeling His grace. When he totally depends only on God, he
fully realizes, His grace.

of Lord Krsna) and Saketaloka (the Abode of Lord Rama), in the
path of devotion while emancipation, salvation or Self-realization,
in the path of knowledge the supreme abode or state attained is
one and the same but it is named differently from the viewpoint -
of different strivers following various paths of discipline (Gita
8/21; 14/27). Where there is God there is His Abode, because -
both of these are, one and the same. As God is omnipresent,
so is His Abode. As soon as, a devotee develops an exclusive .
devotion for Him, no trace of individuality or limitedness remains, .
and he can behold His Divine sport and His Abode, everywhere.
But, a devotee who holds that the Lord resides, in a particular -
Abode, as Goloka or Saketaloka etc., he is carried to that Abode,
either by the courtiers of God, or sometimes even by God, after
the death of his physical body. -
Appendix—About a Jnanayogi the Lord declared, that he
having renounced all sense-objects, controlling his senses, ever -
being engaged in meditation and having abandoned egoism,
mineness, desire, anger etc., becomes qualified to attain Brahma
(18/51—53). But here the Lord declares for a devotee that he by -
performing all prescribed actions according to his order of life
and stage of life, by His grace, attains the Eternal Imperishable
state, because he has taken refuge in Him—‘madvyapasrayah’.
It means that a devotee by taking refuge in the Lord’s holy feet,
easily attains Supreme Abode. A devotee himself has not to attain
salvation, but without having the least dependence on his power
and knowledge etc., he has to take refuge in God, by having
faith in Him. Then only God’s grace leads him to salvation—
*matprasadadavapnoti Sasvatarh padamavyayam’. The Lord sees
that His devotee has taken refuge only in Him,* so He takes no

heed of his flaws. In the Ramacaritamanasa it is mentioned—
rahati na prabhu cita cika kie ki, karata surati saya bara hie ki.
(Bala. 29/3)

‘The Lord does not mind the errors committed by a devotee but
he remembers the good feelings of his heart a hundred times.’
jana avaguna prabhu mana na kai, dina bandhu ati mrdula subhai.

(Uttara. 1/3) ~

‘The Lord does not take heed of the flaws of His devotees,
because He is the friend of the poor and is of a very tender _
(sweet) heart.’

‘madvyapasrayah’—It means—‘Exclusive refuge in Me
without having the least dependence on anyone else.’ .

‘eka bani karunanidhana ki, so priya jakern gati na ana kt.

‘This is the habit of the all-merciful God that the devotee, -
who does not depend on anyone else besides Him, is loving
to Him’ (Manasa, Aranya. 10/4). ——

Mentally dedicating all actions to Me, with Me as the Supreme
Goal, resort to the Yoga of equanimity, and have your mind,
constantly fixed on Me. 57
Comment:—

[In this verse the Lord has laid emphasis on four points:—

(1) Mentally surrender all actions to Me.

(ii) Regard Me, as the Supreme Goal, (Surrender yourself to Me).
"
2045,"Verse 57] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1995

(iti) Renounce your affinity, with the world through equanimity.

(iv) Have your mind constantly fixed, on Me.]

'Cetasa sarvakarmani mayi sannyasya'—A man, mentally |
should regard the body, mind, senses, intellect, things, incidents, |
actions and persons etc., as belonging, only to God. Due to
egoism, he regards them, as his own, which 1s sheer foolishness.

The Lord, has appointed him, as an agent, to make proper use
of things, persons, body, senses and mind etc., given to him. All -
actions, whether mundane or spiritual, which are sanctioned by
scriptures, are performed by His will. So he should surrender, all ~
of these to Him, without having any sense of mineness. :

'Matparah'—A devotee, should think that the Lord is his
only Supreme Goal, none else besides Him is his, and so he =
should surrender himself, to Him. He has nothing to do at all, -
with worldly affairs, things and persons etc., as they are different
from him. If he regards wealth, family, body, senses and mind
etc., as his own, he has to depend on them, and thus he becomes -
a slave to them, though he thinks, that he is their master.

In fact, the Lord is one's own, and He has the greatest regard,
for His devotee. He becomes a servant of him and makes him
a jewel of His crown, while worldly people try to suppress and
making him their slave. Therefore, a person surrendering himself -
to Him, should regard Him, as his Supreme Goal.

‘Buddhiyogamupasritya’—In the Gita, great importance has
been attached to equanimity. If a man becomes equanimous,
he becomes a man of knowledge, of meditation, a Yogi and a
devotee. But, if he is not equanimous, the Lord does not regard
him as perfect, even though, he possesses several other virtues.
Equanimity is naturally found, in man. But, he becomes happy
and sad, by identifying himself with happy and sad circumstances.

So a man should not identify himself, with given circumstances.
He, in fact remains, the same while circumstances appear and
disappear. So, one should remain established, in the self. By
remaining established in the self, he will have equanimity.
"
2046,"1996 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 ~
Equanimity is worship of God (Visnu Purana 1/17/90). So the
Lord, exhorts Arjuna, to resort to the Yoga of equanimity.

'Maccittah satatam bhava'—The mind of a devotee, who |
surrenders himself to God, 1s obeisant at His feet. Then his |
natural claim over the Lord, is revealed and He takes His seat,
in his mind. This is fixing of the mind, on Him.

The Lord uses the term 'Satatam' (constantly) with ""Maccittah’,
to exhort Arjuna to have his mind constantly fixed, on Him.
When a devotee knows the fact, or even assumes, that he is
God's, his mind is automatically fixed, on Him. When a disciple -
accepts his relationship with his preceptor, he constantly thinks :
of him. Even when, he does not think of his preceptor, a thought
remains established in him, because he (the self) has accepted the -
relationship. As far as his relationship with God is concerned,
it has been so since time immemorial. But, by assuming his 7
affinity with the world, he has forgotten the real relationship.

So, 1n order to remind him, of his real connection with Him, He ;
exhorts him, to have his mind constantly fixed, on Him.

While performing mundane activities, a striver, should not
allow his heart to be affected, by being completely absorbed ”
in these. He should keep his heart rigid. But, while performing
spiritual activities, such as chanting, the Lord's name silently

or loudly, adoration and meditation etc., the heart, should be
absorbed, in these activities. By doing so, his mind will be
quickly fixed on Him.
An Important Fact
Pertaining to Love

When a striver, mentally surrenders all actions to God, he
realizes his real disunion, from the world* and when he surrenders

* In fact, a man can never be united with the world. He ever remains
disunited from it. When the thought of a thing, which he lacks, comes to
mind, it is his assumed union, with that thing. The lack of thing makes him
sad. But when he receives the thing, it goes out of his mind and this disunion
makes him happy. Similarly, when a thing is lost or destroyed, a man is sad,
"
2047,"Verse 57] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1997 7
himself to God, he is eternally united, with Him i-e., the Lord
becomes, the dearest object of his love. As far as, a mental
state, in love (union and disunion) is concerned, it can be of
four kinds—union in eternal union, disunion in eternal union,
eternal union in disunion, and disunion in disunion. These, can :
be explained by an illustration:—
When there is union of Lord Krsna and Si Radha, that is
union, in eternal union. When they are united, Sri Radha thinks -
that Lord Krsna, has gone away from her and so she cries, ""O
dear, where have You gone?"" This is disunion, in eternal union. ~
Lord Krsna is not with Sri Radha, but she constantly thinks of Him ;
and feels that He is with her. This is eternal union in disunion.
Lord Krsna, has gone out of sight. But Sri Radha thinks that -
she has not met Lord Krsna, for a long time. She has a desire
to meet Him. This is disunion in disunion. ~
In fact, in all the above-mentioned four states, there is
ever an union of the devotee with the Lord, and there is no _
possibility of disunion. This union is called love, in which the
lover and the beloved, both remain united. This sport of union
and disunion, goes on between a devotee and the Lord, in order :
to exchange love.
This love enhances every moment. When a devotee meets /
the Lord, he is afraid lest, He should again disappear.* So he is
never satisfied, he 1s attracted more and more towards Him, by
thinking lest He should disappear again. Thus love enhances.
In love (devotion), a devotee can have four kinds of
sentiment—of service, of friendship, of affection and of conjugal
because he has interna] union with it. But if through disinclination he realizes,
that it was not his and it could not be his, he is not sad. It means that
there 1s external disunion in assumed internal union, and there is internal
_ disunion, in assumed external union. Thus in fact, there is no union of man
with the world, he assumes his union with it, by an error of judgment.
* Both union and disunion enhance love. If there 1s ever-unton of the two,
love will not enhance, it will remain the same. Therefore the Lord disappears
(conceals Himself) in order to enhance love.
"
2048,"1998 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
love. Out of these four, the sentiment of friendship is superior,
to that of service, the sentiment of affection, is superior to that
of friendship, while the sentiment of conjugal love, is superior
to that of affection because the thought of His glories, majesty
and supremacy goes on decreasing from the first sentiment, to .
the fourth one. But, out of these four, even if one sentiment
attains perfection, the remaining three are, also included in it.
The reason is, that the Lord is perfect, and so is love for Him -
and so is man (soul), being a fragment of the Lord. He remains
imperfect, because of his affinity with the world. If he develops _
his love for Him, in anyway, this love will become perfect. |
In the sentiment of service, a devotee regards himself as a
servant of the Lord, who is his master. So, the Master has full .
control over him and can use his service in anyway, according
to His own sweet will, without consulting him. -
In the sentiment of friendship, the Lord is a friend of the
devotee. The Lord is loving to the devotee, while the devotee
loves God. God has full claim on the devotee, and the devotee :
also on God. So, if a devotee satisfies the desire of the Lord,
the Lord is also expected to fulfil a devotee’s desire. -
In the sentiment of affection, a devotee thinks that he is the
parent or preceptor of the Lord, Who is a child and so it is his
duty, to bring Him up and to look after Him, lest he should hurt ,
himself. When Krsna, went to a forest, Nandababa and YaSsoda,
sent Balarama to look after Him.
In the sentiment of Madhurya (conjugal love)* a devotee
* In the sentiment of Madhurya (conjugal love) generally people think that it
is the relationship between a man and a woman. But in fact it is not confined to a
husband and a wife. ‘Madhurya’ means sweetness and that sweetness develops by
becoming one with the Lord. The more a devotee identifies himself with the Lord,
the more sweetness develops. So if there is perfection in anyone of the sentiments
either of service or friendship or affection, there will be perfect sweetness. .
There is a difference between 'Abheda' (Non-duality) and ‘Abhinnata’
(identification). In non-duality a devotee regards himself as the Lord while |
in identification there is internal intimacy in spite of being two as are two
intimate friends. The more intimacy a devotee develops, the more sweetness
"
2049,"Verse 57] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 1999 ”
does not remember the Lord's supremacy. He thinks, that he

‘is one with Him, because of his intimacy. He longs to provide

Him, with every comfort.

Love is divine and spiritual. Only the Lord, deserves its bliss. :
The lover and the beloved, both are spiritual. In this sentiment of _ |
love, sometimes a lover becomes the beloved, while the beloved:
becomes a lover. In fact, it is the Lord Himself, Who becomes -
two, in order to relish love.

Some worldly ignorant people, do not understand the true
nature of love. They regard lust, as love. But lust can be seen .
in all beings, and specially among ghosts, devils, demons and -
fiends etc. But, only the liberated souls, deserve love.

In lust, both the persons want to receive something or :
the other, from each other, while in love, a devotee wants to _
offer everything to the Lord. In lust, a person wants to satisfy
his senses, while in love he wants to serve the Lord, without
any desire for reward. Lust is physical, while love is spiritual. -
Lust involves delusion and pain, while love is totally free from
delusion and pain, and involves emancipation and infinite bliss. .
In lust, there is attachment and dependence, while in love, there
is relinquishment and independence. Lust is selfish while love
is selfless. A lustful man, becomes a slave to others, while the :
Lord Himself becomes a slave, to a devotee, who possesses
love. Lust changes into insipidity, while love enhances every
moment, and provides bliss. Lust is born of depression, while :
love is revealed out of the happiness, of the beloved. In lust, a
man wants to derive pleasure, while in love a devotee, wants to
please the Lord. Lust leads to hell, while love leads to the abode
of God. In lust, man and woman ever remain two, while in love,
the devotee and the Lord, become one and the same.

Appendix—tIn the preceding verse the Lord, having declared
the attainment of the eternal imperishable state, now tells the
is revealed. This is known as sentiment of love. The Lord reveals Himself in
different forms to taste this love. ee
"
2050,"2000 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 ”
method how to attain that state. For a striver there are two
important duties—to renounce affinity with the world and to
have affinity (love) with God. In the term ‘madvyapasrayah’ used
in the preceding verse, there is predominance of the affinity with ,
God; while in the verse in the term “buddhiyogamupaésritya’ there
is predominance of the renunciation of affinity with the world.

The Lord by the term ‘buddhiyogamupasritya’ means that there
should not persist even the subtle affinity with the world—‘durena
hyavararh karma buddhiyogaddhanaiijaya’ (Gita 2/49); the striver /
should be totally free from attachment and aversion. ,

- By fixing the mind constantly only on God equanimity -
(buddhiyoga) is naturally attained, therefore the expression |
‘maccittah satatarn bhava’ has been used. -

Comment:— |

'Maccittah sarvadurgani matprasadattarisyasi'—The Lord
declares, that by fixing his mind on Him, Arjuna will by His
grace, overcome all obstacles and sorrows, without making any
other effort. - .

When a devotee surrenders his action and himself to the
Lord, and has no attachment for the pleasures, which are born of
"
2051,"Verse 58] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 2001 -
sense contacts, the Lord shoulders the responsibility, to do away
with his evils, if these remain in their subtle form, and enables
him to. realize God. So He declares, that Arjuna will overcome
all obstacles, by His grace. It means, that a devotee by havinga_ _—
disinclination for the world, should have an inclination for God.
He has committed an error, that he has attached himself to the
world. If he renounces this attachment and has an inclination
for God, the Lord by His grace, removes all his obstacles and -
leads him to perfection. : : |
When a man accepts his affinity, with body etc., which are ~
evolutes of prakrti, he has to perform his duty, according to his :
caste and order of life, as sanctioned by scriptures. It is because
of this affinity, that he incurs sin or performs virtuous deeds, -
and has to receive reward.in the form of pain or pleasure. If
he develops a total disinclination for prakrti, and its evolutes, ~
and an inclination for God, he is not bound to perform his
duty, in accordance with his caste and stage of life. Prohibition |
and prescription, do not apply to him, because they have their :
predominance in the domain of prakrti. In the domain of the
Lord, there is predominance of surrender, to Him. -
Man (self), is a fragment of God (Gita 15/7). If he proceeds
towards Him, he becomes free from indebtedness of gods, sages,
creatures, parents and grand parents (manes)* etc., because the -
self or the soul, has never taken or borrowed anything, from
them. The self, being a fragment of God, is perfect. But when
it assumes its affinity with a body, it feels a lack otherwise
not—'The real, never ceases to be’ (Gita 2/16). When he does
not feel a lack (want), how could he be indebted to them? This
is, overcoming all obstacles.
A striver, who follows a spiritual path, observes the Lord's
grace, 1n all obstacles, such as poverty, diseases and also other
disturbances, in the spiritual path. The Lord, removes the obstacles
*'O King, he who abandoning all actions, takes refuge in the Lord,
becomes free from the debt of gods, sages, kith and kin and manes and does
not remain a servant to them.
"
2052,"2002 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
of such a striver, who depends only on Him, and enables him to
attain Him. There is possibility of hurdles being created, in the
spiritual discipline and in God-realization. Therefore, the Lord
declares, that He will remove such hurdles and will lead him .
to His realization.
‘Atha cettvamahankaranna Srosyasi vinanksyasi'—The
Lord because of His abundant grace upon Arjuna, says to him,
that if he, because of egoism does not listen to Him, and does -
not act according to His advice, he will perish. If he does not
hear Him, out of ignorance or by an error, it is pardonable. —
But if he does not listen to Him out of egoism, he will perish, ”
because this egoism will enhance his pride, which is the root
of a demoniac nature. — : -
In the fourth chapter, the Lord said to Arjuna, ""You are My
devotee and friend"" (4/3). Again in the ninth chapter, He said -
to him, “Know it for certain, Arjuna, that My devotee never
perishes"" (9/31). It shows, that Arjuna is a devotee to the Lord, -
so he can never have a disinclination for God, and he can never
perish. But if even he does not listen to the Lord, he will have
a disinclination for Him, and therefore he will have a downfall -
1.e., follow the cycle of birth and death (Gita 9/3; 16/20).
In the fifty-sixth verse of this chapter, Lord Krsna declares,
""Taking refuge in Me, by My grace, a devotee attains, the eternal
imperishable state."" Again here, He declares,""O Arjuna, by My
grace, you will overcome all obstacles."" It means, that the Lord's
grace, is more powerful, than any spiritual discipline. But, it does
not mean that Arjuna should not practise spiritual discipline, he
should make it a part of his duty, to practise it as the only aim
of human life, is God-realization. A person, who does not realize
God, he even on reaching the highest world as that of Brahma,
will have to return from there (Gita 8/16).* Therefore, having |
* © lotus eyed! Those who have not taken refuge in Your feet and whose
"
2053,"Verse 58] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 2003 .
received this human body, a man should realize God, and be free :
from the cycle of birth and death. For a Karmayogi also Lord
Krsna has declared, ""Endowed with equanimity, a person casts
away, in this life, both good and evil"" (Gita 2/50). It means that
the only aim of human life, is to be free from bondage viz., the
cycle of birth and death. |
In the eleventh verse of the tenth chapter, the Lord
declared, ""By My grace, I dispel darkness, born of ignorance, ;
by the shining lamp of wisdom"", while in the forty-seventh verse
of the eleventh chapter, He said, ""By My grace, I have shown ~
you this Universal Form."" By laying emphasis on His grace, :
here He declares, that by His grace the eternal imperishable
state, will be attained (18/56) and by His grace, all obstacles will -
be overcome, (18/58). Having attained the eternal imperishable
state, there is no possibility of any obstacles. But the Lord, lays -
emphasis on this point, to remove Arjuna's fear, who thought that
he would incur sin by waging war, the manes of his race would _
fall, and the age-long caste traditions and family customs, would
get lost. He also thought, that if the sons of Dhrtarastra, armed
with weapons, killed him in battle, while he was unarmed and :
unresisting, it would be better for him (Gita 1/36—46). So the
Lord declares, that by His grace he will overcome all obstacles
ie., he will neither, incur sin in the least, nor be bound. But, by :
His grace being purified, he will attain the Supreme State.
Appendix—The only duty of a devotee is to take refuge in
God and to think of Him only, then the Lord shoulders his full
responsibility. The Lord, by showering His special grace on the
devotee, enables him to overcome all obstacles and leads him
to His attainment—‘yogaksemam vahamyaham’ (Gita 9/22).
Therefore in the ‘Brahmasutra’ it is mentioned—‘visesanugrahasca’
(3/4/38)—‘By devotion to God, God showers His special grace
intellect has not been purified because of being devoid of Your devotion, though
they regard themselves emancipated, yet they are really bound. They even if,
through laborious spiritual discipline, reach high seat, but they fall from there.
"
2054,"2004 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 .
on His devotee.’ In fact God has already bestowed his mercy |
upon every human being but when a devotee takes refuge in
God, he specially realizes that mercy.

If filled with egoism, thou thinkst: ' I will not fight,’ vain is this _
resolve, as your Ksatriya nature will compel thee to fight. 59
Comment:— -
""Yadahankaramasritya'—Cosmic intelligence, is born of prakrti —
and egoism, is born of cosmic intelligence. Out of egoism, a
man thinks, ""I am body."" One who is given to such egoism,
can never be actionless i.e., free from actions, because prakrti is -
ever active and subject to change. He, who has assumed affinity
with it, can never remain actionless (Gita 3/5). -
When a man due to his ego, 1s swayed by ever active
prakrti, he cannot remain actionless. Sometimes, he may seem
doing physical actions, while at times abstaining, from them. -
But, in both states, he does action, as his affinity with the body,
is intact. When, he renounces his affinity with prakrti (body),
then irrespective of his activity or not, he is quite actionless viz.,
detached. Then, nothing remains to be done by him. If a devotee
takes refuge in the Lord, and thus renounces all his connection,
with the body, he is not helplessly driven, to action.
‘Na yotsya iti manyase’'—In the second chapter, Arjuna
having taken refuge in the Lord, prayed to Him, ""I am your
disciple. Instruct me, who has taken refuge, in You"" (2/7). Then
Arjuna bluntly said to Lord Krsna, ""I will not fight"" (2/9). It |
was undesirable, of him to say so, if he really sought refuge
"
2055,"Verse 59] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 2005 .
in the Lord. It was desirable for him to say, that he would act -
according to the Lord's bidding. So the Lord, thought that instead
of taking refuge in Him, he was taking refuge in egoism. Hearing
Arjuna's words full of egoism, Lord Krsna could not help smiling a
_ (2/10). But He had abundant love and grace, for Arjuna. So He
- started preaching, the sermon, in the second chapter. Otherwise,
He would have said then and there, which He has said nov, in
the eighteenth chapter 'Do as you wish’ (18/63). Further, the :
Lord warned him, that if he had taken refuge in Him, he would
not have said, ""I'll not fight."" These words, pricked the Lord's 7
mind. Through the very same words, ""I'll not fight"" the Lord _
. . said to him, that his words proved, that he had taken refuge in
_ his egoism, not in Him. Moreover by taking refuge, he would -
not have been helplessly driven, to action by prakrti (Gita 7/14) _
as prakrti (nature) compels only that person, to action who has
not taken refuge in Him (Gita 7/13).
There is a vital point, which needs attention. By having -
attachment for the objects of nature, a man thinks, that he is
their master. But in fact, he becomes a slave to them, as he © -
depends on them. But he does not become a slave, to those
objects, which he does not regard, as his own. So, he should
not regard the objects as his own, as these are not his own. He -
should hold, that only the Lord, is his. By having this belief,
he should take refuge, in Him. Having taken refuge in Him,
he becomes totally independent. But those, who take refuge in
egoism, circulate in the path of the world of death (9/3). So the
Lord says, 'Prakrtistvarh niyoksyati'—that his, nature of being a |
member of the warrior class, will compel him to fight, and he
will not be able to refrain himself, from war.
'Mithyaisa vyavasayaste'—Resolve, is of two kinds—treal and
unreal. The resolve of our affinity with God is real, while the  __
resolve of our affinity with prakrti (nature), is unreal. In the
former, there is predominance of the self, while in the latter,
"
2056,"2006 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 7
there is predominance of prakrti or inner sense. So the Lord, |
says to Arjuna that his resolve of not fighting, is in vain, as he
is a member of the warrior class. He should depend on the Lord,
not on prakrti (nature) and its evolutes, the world. : |
If a being resolves, that he belongs to the Lord and so he
has to worship Him, with exclusive devotion, his resolve is real,
true and eternal. The Lord, explaining the merit of such a resolve,
declares in the thirtieth verse of the ninth chapter, ""Even if the -
vilest sinner worships Me, with exclusive devotion, he should
be considered a saint; for he has rightly resolved."" The right ~
resolve, is that he is God's and so he will adore Him. |
'Prakrtistvam niyoksyati'—By this expression, the Lord means
to say, that his nature as a warrior, will compel him to fight. The -
nature of a Ksatriya (the member of warrior class) is chivalry,
and not to flee from a battlefield (Gita 18/43). So, he cannot 7
restrain himself from fighting, in a righteous war. |
Appendix—In the preceding verse it was mentioned that _
the ‘fruit’ of egoism would be adverse; while in this verse it is
mentioned that out of egoism the ‘duty’ will not be performed
properly. The Lord means to say that Arjuna’s listening to Him °
or not listening to Him, will not conduce him to a downfall but
out of egoism he will be ruined. Performance of an action or
its non-performance is not an obstacle, but egoism is the main :
stumbling block.
The Lord told Arjuna that by His grace, he would attain Him
and also overcome all his obstacles (18/56, 58). But in spite of
the Lord’s such utterances, Arjuna did not respond, while he
should have said, “I shall act, according to your bidding.” Then
the Lord declares, “If out of ignorance you don’t listen to Me, it
matters little, but if out of egoism, you don’t listen to Me, you
will be ruined.” The Lord means to say that as He shoulders
the full responsibility of a devotee about his means and end, so
should a devotee wholeheartedly take refuge in Him. But if he |
takes refuge in egoism, it means that he has not taken refuge
"

On the one hand the Lord inspires him to perform his duty to
fight; and on the other hand his Ksatriya nature compels him to
fight. If he does not obey the Lord, his Ksatra nature will force .
him to fight. If his nature compels him to fight, he himself will
have to shoulders the responsibility; and if by listening to the

O Arjuna, that action which through delusion you do not
want to do, bound by your own acts born of your nature, you -
will helplessly perform. 60 | |
Comment:—
'‘Svabhavajena kaunteya nibaddhah svena karmana'— Svabhava
(nature), consists of a total sum of actions and inclinations of
the previous birth, the influence of parents of this birth, the
environment and the education, he receives. The same nature
has been called Svadharma (own duty)—""Considering yourown |
duty, you should not waver"" (Gita 2/31).
‘Kartum necchasi yanmohatkarisyasyavaso' pi tat'—Lord Krsna
says to Arjuna, that endowed with martial qualities, such as
prowess and valour etc., of the warrior class, being bound by
"
2058,"2008 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
your Ksatriya nature, you will have to do irresistibly, what you
do not want to perform, out of delusion. The scriptures have also
sanctioned the duties, according to one's own nature. Lord Krsna
declared, ""One's own.duty, though devoid of merit, is preferable .
to the duty of another, well performed"" (Gita 3/35; 18/47). So, |
he is bound to perform the act of fighting, born of his nature.
It is out of delusion, that he is thinking not to fight. a

The nature of liberated souls, is perfectly pure. So, they
are not driven to action, by their nature. But still, they perform
actions, according to their nature. Common people are driven -
to action, under the sway of their nature (3/33). So Lord Krsna .
tells Arjuna, that he will also have to perform action of fighting,
according to the nature of a member of the warrior class, and -
that will not bear good fruit. As if he fights, by obeying either _
the scriptures or the saints or Him, it will lead him to salvation,
because this action, will be free from attachment and aversion.
When a man performs actions, in accordance with ordinances of -
scriptures, or His order, his attachment and aversion for actions,
automatically melt away, as he has an eye on the ordinance or -
the order. Thus, he is not swayed, by attachment and aversion.

In the Gita, it has been mentioned several times, that men
act, as swayed by their own nature (3/5; 8/19; 9/8). And it
has been specially mentioned in 3/33 and here in 18/59.* This
proves, the predominance of one’s own nature. A being's nature,
accompanies him to his birth, in good and evil wombs. If he is
pure of nature, having no attachment to persons and things etc.,
he will not be reborn. It is attachment, to the modes of nature,
which is the cause of birth of the soul (self), in good or evil
wombs (Gita 13/21).

* In Jnanayoga (the Discipline of Knowledge) the man of wisdom
renounces his affinity with Prakrti (Nature) and so he is not compelled to
perform actions by Prakrti (Nature).
"
2059,"Verse 60] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 2009 -
| Now, a question arises, when a man is compelled to perform
actions according to his nature, how will prescription and
prohibition of scriptures be applied? How will the preaching of
preceptors, be translated into practice? How will strivers inculcate -
virtues, by discarding evils and vices? | 7
The answer to the above questions is that, as a man cannot |
stop the flow of the Ganges, but can redirect it, similarly he .
cannot renounce the duty of his caste (Varna), but can purify his
nature, by being free from attachment and aversion, by having
the aim of God-realization. It means, that a man is powerful and -
free, in purifying his nature. -
In the Gita the Lord, has described two disciplines—of action _
and of devotion, to improve one's nature. | :
(1) Discipline of Action:—In the thirty-fourth verse of the -
third chapter, the Lord declared, ""Attachment and aversion are a |
man's foes. So a man, should never come under their sway."" It
means, that instead of performing actions out of attachment and ”
aversion, he should perform these according to the ordinance of
scriptures. If a disciple, carries out the behest of his preceptor, -
with zeal and pleasure, his attachment and aversion get obliterated.
Similar, is the case with a son in relation to his parents, a wife
to her husband and a servant in relation to his master. By doing .
so happily, a man becomes free from attachment and aversion.
But, if he performs action according to his own sweet will,
attachment and aversion are firmly established. When he performs
only prescribed actions happily though his mind misguides him
to do otherwise, his attachment is rooted out. When one is —
prompted not to do some action but if he does it according to ,
the ordinance of the scripture his aversion vanishes. | .
(2) Discipline of Devotion:—When a man takes refuge in
God, and becomes merely an instrument in His hand, he performs —_-
actions, as sanctioned by Him and so attachment and aversion
of his nature, are rooted out. | |
It means, that in the Discipline of Action, when a striver does
"
2060,"2010 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -

not come under the sway of attachment and aversion, his nature

is purified (Gita. 3/34). In the Discipline of Devotion, when a

striver takes refuge in Him, his nature is purified (Gita 18/62).

When nature is purified, there remains no ground for bondage. |
A man performs actions, either after being swayed by

attachment and aversion, or by following scriptural injunctions.

Attachment and aversion, are strengthened if he performs these

under the sway of attachment and aversion. Thus, his nature :

becomes impure. But, if he acts according to the set principles,

his nature, is purified. Strivers, who act according to ordinance ~

of scriptures, advice of great men and liberated souls, having :

only an aim of God-realization, set examples and standards, for

others. So do, great men and emancipated souls (Gita 3/21). -
Appendix—Nature is of two kinds—(1) Nature of performing -

prescribed actions (2) Nature of performing forbidden actions. Out

of these, the nature of performing prescribed actions, being natural,

is ‘sva’—one’s own nature; while the nature of the performance -

of forbidden actions, being “‘agantuka’ (visiting nature) is ‘para’

' (not one’s own). The nature of the performance of prescribed ;

actions, being natural, is not ‘janya’ (born); but the nature of

the performance of forbidden actions being alien is ‘janya’ (born

of attachment, born of bad company). A man’s main duty is to

improve and purify his nature viz., he should give up the nature

of performing forbidden actions and he should conduct himself

well according to the nature which he has formed by performing

the prescribed actions. The Lord has ordered Arjuna to perform

his prescribed duty according to his ‘varna’ (order of life) (caste)

sanctioned by the scripture. : :
The Lord says to Arjuna that either as a matter of duty, or

as Obedience to His order, he will have to fight. Without taking

refuge in Him, his egoism will persist by which even the prescribed

actions will lead him to bondage. But if he takes refuge in Him,

he will get rid of egoism. It is egoism which leads to bondage.

When even a wise man, who is not swayed by nature and whose
"
2061,"Verse 61] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 2011 .
nature is perfectly pure, acts in accordance with his nature, then :
how can a man, who is swayed by his nature and whose nature
is impure, act contrary to (against) his nature?

PILOTS

Link:—Soul (the self) is a fragment of God, and is sentient, |
while nature is self-made and insentient. So how does soul, come

bhramayansarvabhutani yantraridhani mayaya

The Lord dwells in the hearts of all beings, O Arjuna, causing
them by His illusive power, to revolve, in accordance with their
nature, as if they are mounted on a wheel of the body. 61 | 7
Comment:—

""I$varah sarvabhiitanam hrddeée' rjuna tisthati bhramayansarva- -
bhitani yantraridhani mayaya'—The Lord, Who is an impartial
controller, sustainer and conductor, of all beings, causes those
beings to revolve like wooden dolls, mounted on a wheel, who -
have assumed their body, as 'T’ or ‘mine’.

Just as, a man boarding a train goes only to stations, where
it arrives and when he gets off it, he has not to go to those
other stations where the train further goes; similarly, so long as
a man assumes his affinity of 'I'ness and 'mineness’, with this
body, the Lord conducts him, according to his nature* and he
revolves, following the cycle of birth and death. , ,

This affinity of 'Tness and mineness, gives birth to attachment.
and aversion, which make the nature impure. This impurity of

* Nature dwells in the causal body. The same nature is revealed in subtle
body and physical body.
"
2062,"2012 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
nature, compels him to perform actions. But when he renounces |
his affinity with his body, his nature becomes purified, by being
free from attachment and aversion, and he is not helplessly driven,
to action. In that case, he is not conducted, by the illusive power
of the Lord. ,
Now, a doubt arises whether a man is free to act, according to
his will or does he depend for his actions, on any other agency?
If he depends on any other agency, how can he perform, only -
those actions which are prescribed by scriptures? |
The answer is, that as ice is frozen in a refrigerator, and -
heat is produced by a heater, according to their own mechanism,
though both of the machines are run by electricity. Electricity,
has no will and insistence of its own, that it would run only a /
particular machine. But, it works every machine. In the same
way, all beings revolve, according to their own nature, by drawing -
inspiration and energy, from the Lord. It means, that persons of
good nature, perform virtuous deeds, while persons of evil nature, -
perform evil deeds. Thus, one's own nature, is responsible for the
performance of good and evil deeds. But, a point needs special
attention. A man is free in purifying his nature, or in sullying
: it, while other creatures such as birds, beasts and even the gods
are not free, in improving their nature. The Lord by His grace,
has bestowed upon us this human body, so that we may attain
salvation. So a man, should attain it by improving his nature.
When the Lord declares, that He dwells in the hearts of all
beings, He means to say, that just as water pervades everywhere
under the earth, but can be received from a well, similarly, the
Lord pervades everywhere, yet a heart is His special residence.
Similarly, in the third chapter it has been declared, that the all-
pervading Lord, is always present in sacrifice (Yajna) (Gita 3/15).
A striver, generally commits an error, when he assumes that
during adoration, loud-chanting of divine names and meditation
"
2063,"Verse 61] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 2013 7
etc., God is far away from him, and He will not be revealed :
there and then. Similarly, he may think that he does not deserve, |
God-realization. God is not merciful to him, and so on. So he
strengthens the belief, that God is far away from him. But he

should have the conviction, that as God pervades everywhere, -
He is in him and in his body, mind, breath and intellect and

chanting also. There is no one nearer, than He is. By having

this conviction a striver, should practise adoration, chanting and -
meditation etc.

Now a doubt arises, that if we assume that the Lord 1s in _
us, the Lord and we, will be different. The clarification is, that
it is Our egoistic notion, which makes us seem different from -
God. If we accept Him as ours, we become one with Him and
love is revealed.

When the Ganges is flooded, water overflows its banks and 7
is filled in pits etc., which are away, from the river. When again
it flows in its normal course, the water of the pits, is separated |
from the main course. This water is considered defiled, like wine. ;
It is dirty. Several germs and insects are born in it and cause :
diseases. When it. 1s again mixed, with the main stream of the -
Ganges, its impurity, limitedness and unholiness, go away and
it again becomes pure and the holy water of the Ganges.

Similarly, when a man out of his egoistic notion, develops :
a disinclination for God, he is full of several impurities, such as
dependence, hatred, enmity, shortage, disquietude, unevenness,
limitedness, inertness and unholiness etc. But, when again he
has an inclination for the Lord, and takes refuge in Him, Whose
fragment he is, all his impurities, as his separateness from and
slavery for the world, perish. The reason is, that he himself being
a fragment of the Lord, is free from defects. It is because of his
egoistic notion, that defects develop in him.

Appendix—The term ‘bhramayan’ means that the entire
universe is conducted by God’s power—‘mattah sarvam pravartate’

(Gita 10/8). The Lord inspires beings to act according to their
"
2064,"2014 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 .
nature but He does not insist on it. It is because of God’s non- .
insistence, that a man, being swayed (driven) by desire, sense
of mine and attachment, performs virtuous and sinful actions;
and in order to reap their fruit he goes to the heavenly world |
or to hells and lower wombs. But he, who takes refuge in God,
God inspires him specially. Being devoid of egoism, whatever
he does, he does it according to God’s inspiration.

Comment:— 7
[A tendency is generally found, among people, that they /
do not have full faith, in great personalities, because of much
familiarity with them. But when those great persons, leave this
mortal world, people repent at their past actions. Similarly, Lord
Krsna acts as a driver of Arjuna's chariot, and obeys him. When
Lord Krsna says to him, that a devotee who takes refuge in Him,
by his grace obtains supreme peace and eternal abode and fixing |
his mind on Him, he will overcome all obstacles, Arjuna does not
respond. It may mean that Arjuna has not full faith in the words
of Lord Krsna. So Lord Krsna exhorts him to take refuge in the
unmanifest Lord, Who dwells in the hearts of all beings.]
""Tameva Saranam gaccha'—Lord Krsna exhorts Arjuna, to ‘seek
refuge in the omnipresent Lord, Who dwells in the hearts of all
"
2065,"Verse 62] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 2015 -
beings and Who directs them.’ It means, that instead of depending

on perishable things, incidents, circumstances and persons etc.,

he should depend, only on the imperishable Lord.

In the preceding verse, the Lord mentioned that He causes
the beings, who assume affinity of ‘ness and 'mineness' with |
the body, to revolve as if mounted on a machine. Here by using
the term ‘eva’ (even) Lord Krsna, exhorts Arjuna not to have
the least affinity of ‘ness and 'mineness' with body, but seek -
refuge in God alone.

'‘Sarvabhavena'—It means, that Arjuna should think of Him ~
with his mind, should worship Him with his body, and should _
remain pleased in (all happenings through) His sweet will, whether
desirable or undesirable, for him. He should be specially happy -
with undesirable circumstances, by thinking that the Lord has
created such circumstances, against him for his welfare even -
against his will without consulting him in order to, enable him
to attain salvation. -

'Tatprasadatparam Santirh sthanam prapsyasi Sasvatam'— Lord
Krsna, announced, ""By My grace, one attains the eternal state""

(18/56) and ""By My grace, thou shalt overcome all obstacles"" :
(18/58). The same fact, has been pointed out here, when He
declares, ""By the grace of the Lord, Who dwells in the heart,

you will obtain, supreme peace and eternal abode."" In the Gita, _ :
Supreme peace has been called, eternal abode. But here, the

Lord has used both these expressions together. So here ‘Para

Santi’ (Supreme peace), should mean total disinclination, for the

world, while Sasvata sthana (eternal abode) should denote the

eternal divine abode.

Here, Lord Krsna has exhorted Arjuna to take refuge in the
all-pervading God. So a doubt arises, whether Lord Krsna, is not
the all-pervading God.

The clarification is that the refuge (shelter) in the all-pervading
Lord has been called more secret, than all secrets (18/63) while |
refuge in the person of Lord Krsna, has been called the most
"
2066,"2016 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
~ gecret of all. It shows that Lord Krsna is greater than, the all-
pervading God. , |
Lord Krsna also declared, ""Though unborn and imperishable
and also the Lord of all beings, I manifest Myself through My 7
power, (Maya)” (4/6); ""Having known Me, as the Enjoyer of
sacrifices and austerities, the Great Lord of all the worlds, and
the Disinterested Friend of all beings, My devotee, attains Me"" ;
(5/29); ""But those who do not regard Me, as the Enjoyer and
the Lord of all the worlds, fall"" (9/24). It also proves by positive
and. negative inference, that Sri Krsna is the Supreme Lord. -
-\ In this chapter it is mentioned, that the Lord dwells in the
hearts of all beings (18/61) and in the fifteenth chapter, it is
mentioned that He (Lord Krsna) is lodged in the hearts of all -
(15/15). It means that the all-pervading Lord, and Lord Krsna 2
are not two, but both are, one.
Then why did Lord Krsna say to Arjuna, ""Take refuge in
Me alone.” The reason is, that in the fifty-sixth verse Lord Krsna 7
said, ""By My grace, one attains the eternal imperishable state"";
in the fifty-seventh and fifty-eighth verses He said, ""Surrender to
Me. By My grace you will overcome all obstacles."" But Arjuna
did not speak viz., he did‘not express his acceptance by words
or demeanour. Jt means, that Arjuna did not believe in what
Lord Krsna said. Then Lord Krsna scolded him, ""If filled with
egoism, thou thinkst; ‘I will not fight,’ vain is this, thy resolve.
Nature will compel thee"" (18/59). Arjuna did not respond even
to this scolding. So Lord Krsna had to say, ""If you don't want
to take refuge in Me, seek refuge in the Lord, Who dwells in
the hearts of all beings."" , ,
In fact, Lord Krsna and the Lord Who dwells in the heart
of all beings, are one and the same.
Appendix—The Soul (Self) is a fragment only of God.
Therefore Lord Krsna exhorts Arjuna to seek refuge in only
God. When a man takes refuge in God, he gets rid of egoism.
So long as a man (the Self) is not under the control (refuge) of
"
2067,"Verse 63] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 2017 ~

God, he is swayed by ‘prakrti’ (nature). The more he is inclined

towards the inert matter (non-Self), the more he is endowed with

the demoniac nature; and the more he is inclined towards pure

consciousness, the more he is endowed with the divine nature.

Comment:— a -
'Iti te jianamakhyatam guhyadguhyataram maya'—The term

‘Iti’ (thus), stands for refuge, in the omnipresent Lord, Who dwells

in the hearts of all beings. This teaching is more secret* while the
* Wise men endowed with equanimity, renouncing the fruit of actions, attain

the blissful supreme state (2/51); the perfection which is attained by Jiianayoga

is also attained by Karmayoga (4/38); a Karmayog! attains to the Absolute, in

no time (5/6); abandoning attachment to the fruit of actions, the Karmayogi

attains peace (5/12). Thus Karmayoga (Discipline of Action), has been declared

to be an independent means, to realize God. So it is said to be a secret.
By renouncing affinity with the world, seeking refuge in God, Who is

formless, is more significant, than Karmayoga. Therefore it is called more secret.
I am imparting to you the ancient Yoga which I taught to sun-god (4/3);

all this world is pervaded by Me (9/4); I surpass the perishable and am higher

even than the imperishable, I am known as the Supreme Person (15/18). In

these statements the Lord has shown His lordliness. So this is called the |

greatest or sovereign secret. |
Abandoning all duties seek refuge in Me alone, I shall release thee from
"
2068,"2018 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -

teaching of Karmayoga (Discipline of Action), is a mere secret.
'Vimrsyaitadasesena'—The Lord, having told Arjuna, the more

secret knowledge, in the form of surrender tells him, that the

topic of refuge, is full of devotion. So Lord Krsna asks Arjuna, -

| to reflect over this topic of surrender, refuge or devotion, fully.

The term ‘etat', denotes the topic of refuge, described in the

fifty-sixth and fifty-seventh verses of this chapter, while the term ;

‘aSesena’ denotes the topic of devotion, described in the whole

of Gita.* Through the expression ""Vimrsyaitadasesena’, the Lord

expresses His special grace, in a secret way. The Lord, wants ~

that he should not have a disinclination for Him. If he ponders .

all sins; grieve not (18/66). This is called His supreme word, the most |

secret of all. -
That Yogasastra is said to be the supreme secret in which all the disciplines

of Action, of Knowledge and Devotion are described (18/68,75). —
*In the Gita the topic of devotion has been described in the following

verses—Among all the Yogis, he who full of faith worships Me, is deemed

by Me to be the most devout (6/47); those who take refuge in Me alone -

cross this Maya (divine potency) (7/14); such a great soul, who realizes that

all this ts God, is very rare (7/19); I am easily attainable to the Yogi who

constantly thinks of Me with undivided mind (8/14); the Supreme Person is _

attainable only by exclusive devotion (8/22); great souls possessing a divine

nature worship Me constantly with undivided mind (9/13); the devotees of

firm resolve, constantly chanting My names and glories, and bowing to Me,

worship Me with single-minded devotion (9/14), I secure what is not already ;

possessed and personally attend to the needs of those devotees who worship

Me alone (9/22); whosoever offers to Me with devotion a leaf, a flower, a fruit,

or water, that offering of love, I accept (9/26); whatever you do, whatever you

eat, whatever you offer in sacrifice, whatever you give, whatever you do as

penance, offer it all to Me (9/27); you wili be freed from the bonds of action

yielding good and evil fruits (9/28); fix your mind on Me, be devoted to Me, -

adore Me, bow down to Me (9/34); I dispel the darkness born of ignorance

of My devotees so that they may attain Me (10/9—11); through single-minded

devotion I can be seen and known and even entered into (11/54); the devotee

who regards Me as his supreme goal reaches Me (11/55); those who worship

Me with supreme faith are the best in Yoga (12/2); I rescue those from the

ocean of birth and death who worship Me with single-minded devotion (12/6-7);

by fixing your mind on Me and your intellect in Me alone, thereafter you will

abide in Me (12/8); He who worships Me with exclusive devotion transcending

the three modes becomes eligible for attaining Brahma (14/26); he, who

worships Me with his whole being, is the knower of all (15/19) and so on.
"
2069,"Verse 63] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 2019 .
over His gospel, he will realize the reality, that none is superior
to, more loving and more merciful, than Him.

'Yathecchasi tatha kuru'—Lord Krsna advises Arjuna, to reflect
fully over His teaching and then do, as he best wishes. It shows,
Lord Krsna's manifest intimacy, grace and benevolence, for him.

In verse (7/2) when the Lord declares, that He will unfold to
him in its entirety, this knowledge with realization and in (9/1), -
when He states that He will declare knowledge with realization,
and in (10/1) when He asks him to listen to His supreme word, ,
these show His common grace, for Arjuna. But, in (18/58) when ~
He says to Arjuna, that if he does not act according to His :
advice, he will perish, it is His special grace.

When Lord Krsna asks Arjuna, to do as he wishes, Arjuna -
is very much perturbed by thinking, that the Lord is abandoning .
him. A devotee, can tolerate his chiding, but cannot bear his
separation from the Lord. Arjuna, was not so much perturbed,
when he was admonished by the Lord, with the words that he -
would perish if he did not act according to His advice, as he was
now. He thinks, that he committed a blunder, that in spite of the -
Lord's loving advice warning, and exhortation to taking refuge,
in the all-pervading God, he did not respond favourably. So at
last the Lord, had to say ""Do as thou wishest."" By thinking so
Arjuna, feels miserable to express himself to the Lord. He now |
feels very sad and dejécted. So the Lord utters the most secret
words, of his own accord, in the next verse.

Appendix—‘Yathecchasi tatha kuru’—The Lord asks Arjuna
to do as he best wishes—Lord Krsna does not make this utterance
in order to abandon him but in order to attract him towards Him :
specially; as when a ball is thrown towards a wall with force, it
is done to catch it again, rather than to abandon it. It means that
the Lord in the preceding verse, having mentioned that Arjuna
should take refuge in immanent formless God, now wants to
attract Him towards Himself viz., towards God Who is endowed
with attributes and with form so that Arjuna may not be deprived
"
2070,"2020 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 18 _
of the attainment of the Lord’s entire form. The formless God
(Brahma) does not comprise God endowed with form, but God
endowed with form comprises formless God (Brahma).
— Link:—In the preceding verse, Lord Krsna ordered Arjuna,
to reflect over His teaching fully and over its gist. But Arjuna
could not grasp the gist of His teaching, because the purport of _
the teaching is not known, as much to a listener, as to speaker.
Secondly, Lord Krsna asked him to do as he wished. Hearing -
_ these words, he got despondent. So Lord Krsna, giving him the
quintessence of His teaching consoles him. -

'‘Sarvaguhyatamam bhiyah srmu me paramarh vacah'—In the
sixty-third verse, the Lord told Arjuna, the wisdom which was
more secret (refuge in God) than the teaching of Karmayoga,
which was secret, while in (9/1) and (15/20) He imparted the
most secret teaching (Guhyatamam—His glory). But He did not
convey, His supremely secret word (Sarvaguhyatamam), before.

| It is only here, that He unfolds it to him.

He also warns Arjuna, that this supreme word, should not be
disclosed to a man who is without austerity, nor to one, without
devotion, because it is the most secret, of all the other secrets,
disclosed so far.* (This is—Abandoning ail duties, seek refuge in

2071,"Verse 64] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 2021 -
Me alone). This is the supremely secret teaching, of the Gita. |

In the seventh verse of the second chapter, Arjuna said,
""Being tainted by the vice of faint-heartedness, and my mind
puzzled, with regard to duty, I ask you. Tell me that which is .
decidedly good; I am your disciple. Pray instruct me, who has |
sought refuge in you.” So Lord Krsna (in 18/66) says, ""Abandoning
all duties, seek refuge in Me alone. I shall release you from all
sins; grieve not."" This is Lord Krsna's supreme word, the top -
secret of all secrets.

By the expression 'Bhiyah $rnu,' (listen again) Lord Krsna ~
means to say, that He also imparted His teaching to him, even :
before, but at that time he failed to take special note of it. So, He

- was conveying the mystery of all mysteries again, and expected -
that Arjuna would listen to it, with rapt attention.

This gospel was imparted to him in (18/57) when the Lord
said to him, ""Have your mind constantly fixed on Me,"" and
also in (18/58) when He declared, ""Fixing your mind on Me, -
you will by My grace, overcome all obstacles."" But He did not
use the expression ‘Sarvaguhyatamam’ (the supreme secret of
all) before, and Arjuna did not take any special note of it. So, -
again My supreme word, O mighty-armed,""while here He says, ""Hear again My
supreme word, the most secret of all."" The difference is that there He used the -
words 'mighty-armed’ while here ‘the most secret of all.’ There in (10/9) He
used 'Maccittah’ (with their minds wholly fixed on Me), while here He uses in
(18/57-58) the term 'Maccittah' (with thy mind fixed on Me). The difference is
that the former teaching is for the general people while the latter is specially .
for Arjuna as He uses the second person for him. There He declared that by
His grace his ignorance would be dispelled while here He says that by His
grace he will overcome all obstacles.

There in (10/1) He said, ""I shall speak to you, who are so loving out
of solicitude for your welfare"" while here He says, ""I shall tell you what is
good for you."" There in 9/34 having said 'Fix your mind on Me' He said, ""O
mighty-armed, hear once again My supreme word” (10/1), while here having
said, “Hear again, My supreme word, the most secret of all"" (18/64) He said,

""Fix your mind on Me” (18/65).

As the expression, ‘Sarvaguhyatamam’ (the supreme secret of all) has
been used once, so has the sentence, ""Abandoning all duties, take refuge in
Me alone” (18/66).
"
2072,"2022 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 7
in order to divert Arjuna's attention to His supreme word, the
supreme secret of all, Lord Krsna uses this expression.

'Isto'si me drdhamiti'—The Lord, in the preceding verse
admonishing him, asked him to do, as he wished. What can be |
a more severe punishment, to an obedient devotee, than these |
words of indifference? Arjuna having heard these words, is
perturbed, by thinking that the Lord is abandoning him. In order
to remove his fear He consoles him by saying, “weil beloved :
art thou of Me."" Had Arjuna not been perturbed, there would
not have been any need for Lord Krsna, to tell Arjuna, that he -
was well beloved of Him. |

Moreover, Lord Krsna uses the term ‘Ista’ (favourite),
because He considers His devout devotee as His favourite deity. -
As a devotee, with exclusive devotion, regards the Lord as his
favourite deity, so does the Lord, as He declares, ""Howsoever ~
men approach Me even so do I seek them"" (Gita 4/11). In the
Bhagavata, Lord Krsna says to Uddhava, ""O Uddhava, neither
Brahmaji nor Lord Sankara, nor Balaramaji, nor Laksmiji, who :
reside in My body nor My soul, is so much loving to Me, as a
devout devotee like, you."" : -
By using the term 'Drdham’, the Lord means to say to Arjuna,
that he should be free from fear, because he has accepted ""I have
sought refuge in You"" (Gita 2/7). The reason is, that anyone ""
who having sought refuge in Him, says from his heart even
once, ""I am only yours,""the Lord grants him security, from all
beings such is His vow.

‘Tato vaksyami te hitam'—Lord Krsna says to Arjuna, that
he is His loving friend and therefore, He will impart to him the
teaching of taking refuge in Him, which is the supreme secret of
all. Further, He will unfold it to him, to do good to him, without
hoping for any reward, from him. It proves that a man's welfare
or good, lies in taking refuge, in the Lord, without depending
on anyone else. :

The man (soul), is a fragment of God, and so he should
"
2073,"Verse 65] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 2023 ”
depend only on God, and he should take refuge in him, only.

If he depends on things, incidents, circumstances and persons

etc., he will have to be sad and worried, because all of these

are perishable. As coal ignites in the fire, but it becomes black, -
when it is separated from fire, similarly, if a man (soul) (self),

has an inclination for the Lord and takes refuge in Him, he

shines, by becoming one with the Lord and may lead the world

to salvation. But, if he has a disinclination for the Lord, he has ;
to suffer and follow a cycle of birth and death.

Appendix—In ‘tameva Saranam gaccha’ (18/62), ‘take refuge ~
in Him alone’—there 1s refuge in formless God and in ‘mamekam _
Saranam vraja’ (18/66), ‘take refuge in Me alone’—there is refuge
in God endowed. with attributes. By taking refuge in the formless -
Brahma, a striver attains salvation, but by taking refuge in God
endowed with form, a striver besides attaining salvation also 7
attains love (devotion). Therefore refuge in God endowed with
form is ‘sarvaguhyatama’ viz., the Supreme Secret of all. The Lord -
in the reference of only devotion, uses the expression ‘Supreme
word’. In the first verse of the tenth chapter also the Lord asked
Arjuna to listen to His Supreme word——‘Srmu me paramarh vacah’. ”

Arjuna said to Lord Krsna, “I am your disciple” —‘Sisyaste’ ham’

(2/7), but the Lord says to him, “you are my beloved
friend’”—“‘isto’si’. It means that the spiritual guide (preceptor) :
initiates the pupil but the Lord, instead of having the teacher-

pupil relationship, makes a devotee his friend.

Every activity of the Lord is for the welfare of others but
in this reference special welfare is solicited, so the Lord says
‘tato vaksyami te hitam’. :

Fix thy mind on Me; be devoted to Me;. worship Me; prostrate
thyself before Me; so shalt thou come unto Me. I promise thee
truly, for thou art dear to Me. 65
Comment:— | .

'Madbhaktah'—A striver, first of all should change his egoistic |
notions (‘I' ness), by accepting, that he belongs to the Lord.
Without changing the ego, he cannot make speedy progress. By .
doing so, his progress in the spiritual path, becomes easy and
natural. Hence first of all a striver should be devoted to Me.

A disciple accepts a person as his preceptor, and then he
becomes of his preceptor. A girl after her marriage accepts her :
husband as hers, by changing her egoism and so she becomes |
attached to the family, of her husband. Similarly, a striver should ;

: accept that he is of the Lord only, and only the Lord is his; he -
does not belong to the world, and the world does not belong to
him (when egoism changes, mineness also naturally changes).

‘Manmana bhava'—When a striver, assumes that he belongs
to the Lord and the Lord belongs to him, He becomes naturally
loving to him as He is his own and then his mind is naturally
fixed on Him. In that case, he naturally thinks of His name, glory
and sport etc. Moreover, he recites His name and meditates on
Him, very promptly and affectionately.

""Madyaji'—When a striver, becomes of the Lord, by changing
his egoism, he serves Him by performing actions. The more his
intimacy with the.Lord develops, the more devoted, he becomes
in rendering service, to Him. That service, changes into adoration.

So whatever worldly, household or bodily work he does, becomes
worship of the Lord. He has a firm conviction, that he has to
do nothing, except worship God.

""Marh namaskuru'—A striver, by prostrating himself before
the Lord, should totally surrender himself, to Him. In that case, he
should be extremely happy, both in favourable and unfavourable
circumstances, by regarding it, as gracious divine dispensation.
"
2075,"Verse 65]: -SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 2025 ”
He holds, that whatever God does is, for his welfare, whether
he understands it or not, as He is a disinterested friend of all
beings. So, he should think, that the Lord, by creating desirable
or undesirable circumstances, is absolving him of his good deeds -
and sins, and making him pure, so that he may be attracted
towards His feet. This is prostration, before the Lord.
'Mamevaisyasi satyam te pratijane priyo'si me'—Lord Krsna, .
promises truly to Arjuna, that by fixing his mind on Him, by
being devoted to Him, by worshipping Him, by prostrating himself -
before Him, he will come to Him* because he is dear to Him. |
By the term 'Priyo'si' (thou art dear), the Lord means that -
every being (soul), is very dear to Him, because it is His fragment. |
He may, send it to eighty-four lac forms of lives or even to hell, :
but His aim is to purify it. This gracious dispensation of the -
Lord, towards all beings, reveals His loving nature. So Arjuna
here, represents all beings.
Every being (soul), is very loving to God. A human being,
having a disinclination for God, assumes worldly perishable
things, such as wealth, property, family, body, senses, mind, -
intellect and life-breath etc., as his own, while the world has
never accepted him, as its own. All the worldly things, are
kaleidoscopic and perishable, while he himself is unchanging /
and imperishable. But he commits an error, by assuming his
affinity, with the changing world, as eternal. This is the reason,
that this affinity with a person persists, even when a person is
dead. This assumed affinity, is the cause of his fall. He is free,
whether he accepts this affinity or he does not accept it. So, by |
renouncing this assumed affinity, he should realize his real and
eternal affinity with God and should take refuge, in Him.

here the Lord by using the term ‘mamevaisyasi’ means that he
will know Him in His entirety, about which the Lord at the
beginning of the seventh chapter said, “asarhSayam samagram |

intimacy with Him viz., he will become the Lord’s own self,
about which the Lord said in the seventh chapter ‘jfiani tvatmaiva

Abandoning dependence on all duties (dharma), take refuge ;
in Me, alone. I shall liberate you from all your sins; therefore
grieve not. 66
Comment:—
‘Sarvadharmanparityajya mamekam Saranam vraja'—Lord
Krsna, exhorts Arjuna to take refuge, in Him by abandoning
dependence on all duties and determination of his duty i.e., what
to do and what not to do. Refuge in the Lord, is the quintessence,
of the gospel of the Lord. When a devotee takes refuge in Him,
like a chaste wife, he has to do nothing, for himself. As a chaste
wife, performs every action, in order to please her husband, without
thinking of her own taste and inclination, and her husband's
Gotra (sub caste) becomes hers, similarly, a devotee who takes
refuge in Him, surrenders everything to Him and becomes, free
from worry, fear, sorrow and doubt. :
Here the term ‘Dharma,’ stands for duty. The reason, is that
"
2077,"Verse 66] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 2027 -
from the forty-first verse to the forty-fourth verse, the terms ,
‘Svabhavaja Karma’ (duties born of their natures) have been used.

In the first half of the forty-seventh verse, the term 'Svadharma,'

(one’s own duty) has been used. Again, in the second half of the .
forty-seventh verse and also in the forty-eighth verse, the term
‘Karma’ (Duty) has been used. It means, that in this context at

the beginning and the end the term ‘Karma,’ has been used, while

in the middle the term 'Svadharma,' (one's own duty) has been

used. So the term 'Dharma,' stands for duty. —

Now a question arises, whether one's duties should be .
practically abandoned. The answer is that it is not proper to -
abandon one's duties, because in response to the order of Lord
Krsna, Arjuna says, ""I shall act according to Your word"" (18/73). -
Then he carried out His order, and waged war. Moreover, in the =
sixth verse of this chapter, the Lord declared, ""Acts of sacrifice,
gift and penance and all other duties, must be performed.""*

* [In the third chapter there is description that a man should not abstain from :
actions. ""Not by non-performance of actions does a man reach actionlessness,
nor by mere renunciation does he attain to perfection"" (3/4).""None can remain _
inactive even for a moment"" (3/5). ""He who restraining the organs of action,
thinks of the sense-objects, is called a hypocrite” (3/6). ""He who controlling
the senses by the mind engages himself in action, he excels"" (3/7). ""Perform
your allotted duty because desisting from action, you cannot even maintain _
your body” (3/8). ""Perform action for the sake of sacrifice alone” (3/9). Having
created mankind at the beginning of creation, the creator, Brahma said to them,

""By this shall ye propagate; let this be the milch-cow to provide you necessities
for sacrifice""(3/10). ""You and the gods fostering each other shall attain to the
supreme good "" (3/11). ""He who enjoys the gifts without giving to the gods
in return is a thief” (3/12). ""Those who partake of what is left after sacrifice,
are absolved of all sins while those who cook for the sake of nourishing their
body alone, eat only sin’ (3/13). ""He who does not perform his duties, lives
in vain"" (3/16). ""A man by performing actions without attachment attains the
supreme."" (3/19). ""It is through action alone that Janaka and other wise men
reached perfection. You should perform action with a view to the maintenance
of the world” (3/20). The Lord says, ""If I don't perform actions, I should be
the creator of confusion of castes and destruction of these people"" (3/23-24).
“The wise should act without attachment as the unwise act with attachment"" |
(3/25). “Let no wise man unsettle the mind of ignorant people attached to
action, but should get them to perform all their duties, duly performing them
"
2078,"2028 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 18 ~
After studying the Gita, it becomes clear, that a man should

not renounce his duties, under any circumstances. Arjuna thought

that it was better to live on alms, than to perform his duty, in

slaying the honoured teachers in the war (2/5); but Lord Krsna, ;

exhorted him to wage such a righteous war, by saying that there

is nothing more welcome for a man of the warrior class, than a

righteous war (2/31—38). It proves, that one should not renounce

one's duty, which has been prescribed for him, according to his -

caste, stage of life and circumstances etc. |
Then, why does Lord Krsna say to Arjuna, to abandon all 7

duties? The Lord means to say that all duties, must be offered -

to Him. By doing so, a striver, will not depend on duties, but

will depend on God. The Lord, declares, that those who depend -

on duties, (actions) are subject to birth and death (Gita 9/21). _

By depending only on Him, one need not decide, what ought to

be done and what ought not to be done. It practically happened,

in Arjuna's life. -
Arjuna was fighting against Karna. The wheel of Karna's

chariot, got stuck in mud. Karna was trying to push it out. So .

he said to Arjuna, ""You are in the chariot but I am not in a

chariot. You possess knowledge of scriptures, and you are well-

versed in the science of arms, like Sahasrarjuna. You also know :

the science of ethics. So it is not proper on your part to shoot

arrows, at me”. So Arjuna did not shoot any arrows. Then Lord

Krsna said to Karna, ""It is righteous, rather than sinful, to kill

such a desperado, as you.* Six chariot-warriors, including you

have murdered Abhimanyu, who was alone. Therefore, there

is no use for you to support righteousness. It is fortunate, that

you are reminded of righteousness, at this moment. But he who

himself, does not translate righteousness into practice has no

himself” (3/26). Thus the Lord has laid great emphasis on the performance of

one's duty in the third chapter. v
* A desperado who is bent upon doing harm to anyone should be killed.

Such a killer does not incur any sin (evil).
"
2079,"Verse 66] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 2029 -
right to preach it, to others."" Having uttered these words Lord
Krsna, ordered Arjuna to shoot arrows. By obeying Him, Arjuna
began to shoot these. | |
If Arjuna, had taken the decision about his duty, by applying
his intellect, he would have committed an error of judgment. |
But he left it to the Lord and it was He, Who took the right
decision.
Arjuna, was in a dilemma whether to fight or not to fight
(2/6). He thought, that if he fought, there would be destruction
of his family, and sin would overtake the entire family. The 7
women of the family, would become corrupt, and there would _
ensue an intermixture of castes. Thus, age-long, caste-traditions
and family customs, would die (1/39—44). On the other hand, -
there was nothing more welcome, for a man of the warrior class, -
than a righteous war. Therefore, Lord Krsna asks Arjuna, to
entrust Him with the task of taking the decision, about his duty,
without being confused about it. -
'‘Mamekam Saranarn vraja'—Here the term ‘'ekam’ (alone),
stands for exclusive or undivided. In (3/2) and (5/1) also Arjuna
by using the term ‘ekam' (one) asked Lord Krsna, to tell him
definitely, the one discipline by which he might attain bliss.
So Lord Krsna in response to his question, says that exclusive
(undivided) refuge is the best discipline, to attain bliss or God-
realization.
In the Gita, Lord Krsna has laid, time and again, great
emphasis on the merit of, exclusive devotion. ""Those who take
refuge in Me alone, get over this divine delusion of Mine’ (7/14);
‘I am easily attainable to the Yogi (ascetic) who always and
constantly, thinks of Me, with undivided mind’ (8/14).* For those
men who worship Me alone, I provide, what is not possessed and
preserve what they already possess’ (9/22); ‘Through single-minded
devotion, I can be seen and known and even entered into’ (11/54);
'I speedily deliver, from the ocean of birth and death, those who
*'Undivided mind' stands for exclusive devotion or exclusive dependence.
"
2080,"2030 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
meditate on Me, with single-minded devotion’ (12/6-7); ""Those |
who worship Me with exclusive devotion, transcend the three
modes of nature’ (14/26). Thus, having described the merit of
exclusive devotion, the Lord gives the quintessence of the entire |
gospel, of the Gita by declaring, ""Take refuge in Me alone."" It
means that the Lord, is the means as well as, the end. |
The sentence ‘Mamekarh Saranarh vraja' means, that a striver,
should take refuge in Him, not by mind and intellect, but by the -
self. When he himself takes refuge by the self, his mind, body,
senses and intellect etc., automatically take refuge, in Him. -
- ‘Aham tva sarvapapebhyo moksayisyami ma Ssucah'—It may :
be thought, that Lord Krsna allured Arjuna to liberate him, from
the sin, as he was afraid of, in the first chapter. But, it is not :
reasonable, because, as soon as a man seeks refuge in the Lord,
his sins of millions of births perish. If the Lord wanted to allure -
him, that he would liberate him from all sins, He would have
done it earlier, before he took refuge in Him. -
When the Lord declares, that He will liberate him from
all sins, He means to say, that having taken refuge in Him, if
he finds that he has not got rid of evil propensities, has not ;
developed devotion to God, and has not beheld Him, he need
not worry. It is the Lord's responsibility, to free him from all
defects. If he himself wanted to shoulder the responsibility, it /
shows that he has not yet taken refuge. When he has taken
refuge in Him, he should be free from worry, sadness, fear
and doubt. If these evils, crop up in him, they will prove to be
obstacles in refuge and the responsibility (burden) will remain
his. This responsibility, is a blot on refuge. After he has taken
refuge in Him, his shortcomings are the Lord's, and his whole
responsibility, goes to the Lord. .
When Vibhisana took refuge in Lord Rama, Rama shouldered
his full responsibility. Once in a village named Vipraghosa, a
Brahmana (a member of the priest class), was killed by him.
First, he was badly beaten up and then he was chained and
"
2081,"Verse 66] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 2031 -
imprisoned. When Lord Rama came to know of this incident,
He flew to Vipraghosa by the airy vehicle, named Puspaka. The
villagers, extended a cordial welcome to Lord Rama, and said to
Him, that Vibhisana had murdered a Brahmana and so they gave -
him a severe beating, but he was not killed. Lord Rama said,
""Oh, people of the priest class, I have granted him an age of a
Kalpa (consisting of 4,32,00,00,000 years of mortals), and also a -
kingdom. How can he be killed? Moreover, he is My devotee. The
responsibility of the crime of a servant, goes to his master, and
the master deserves punishment. Therefore instead of Vibhisana, ~
punish Me."" The Brahmanas, having perceived the affection of :
Lord Rama for a person who has taken shelter in Him, were
wonder-struck and all of them sought refuge in Him. -
It means that 'I am the Lord's and the Lord is mine;' this _
is the quintessence of all spiritual disciplines. Nothing, such
as eligibility, capability, qualification and virtue, is equal to a
sense of mine, with the Lord. A weeping child, awakens all the -
members of a family at midnight and they try their best to please
the child. Why? Because, the child is theirs. So a devotee, who
has taken refuge in the Lord, should hold that he is the Lord's :
and only the Lord is his.
‘Ma sucah' means—
(1) Having taken refuge in me, if you grieve, it is out of
your pride and it is a crime and it is a blot, on refuge. |
When you have taken refuge in Me, you should totally depend
on Me. If you do not totally depend on Me, it is a crime. If you
worry after thinking of your shortcomings, it means that you
have pride of your own strength because you want to get md :
of these by your own. power.* If you have defects, you should
be sad, but not worried, like a child who starts weeping without

worrying, when he sees a dog coming towards him. But if you
worry, the people will laugh at you, and at Me. They will think
that a devotee of God is worried, and the Lord does not rid him |
of it. It means that your lack of faith in Me, brings a blot on :
Me, and My refuge. Therefore, abandon your worry. )
(2) Do not worry, even if your thoughts and feelings, have
not been purified. It is My responsibility, to purify these. :
(3) In the seventh verse of the second chapter, Arjuna says
to Lord Krsna, that he has taken refuge in Him. But in the eighth _
verse, he says that even on obtaining undisputed sovereignty, |
and an affluent kingdom on the earth, and lordship over the -
gods, he does not see any means, that can drive away the grief,
which is affecting his senses. At this, the Lord seems to say -
to Arjuna, that he is right because a man cannot be free from _
grief, so long as he is attached to perishable persons and objects.
But, it 1s a blunder on his part, if he grieves even after having
taken refuge in Him. -
(4) A devotee, having taken refuge in the Lord, should |
not worry what will happen to him, here or hereafter. In this .
connection a devotee said, ""O slayer of Narakasura, you may
provide me residence, either in heaven or hell or on the earth
and behave towards me, in anyway according to Your sweet will.
But I have only one demand, that I may go on thinking of your
most beautiful feet, which excel the beauty of an autumn-lotus
of season, even at the time of my death.
When a devotee, assumes that he is the Lord's and the Lord is
his, his defects such as worry, fear, sadness and doubt, are rooted
out. The reason is, that all defects are based on his dependence
on the world, including the body, and on his disinclination, for
the Lord. As soon as his affinity, with the Lord gets a firm
footing, all his defects perish. |
The criteria of one's firm affinity, with the Lord are the following:—
"
2083,"Verse 66] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 2033 -
- (1) Fearlessness:—The devotee who takes refuge in the Lord,
becomes free from external fear, as that of poisonous snakes, |
and scorpions, and wild beasts such as lion etc., and also from
internal fear, of evil propensities etc. A striver, should not have :
such a fear, that his tendencies may be of evil nature, as by
God's grace, he becomes saturated with divine mercy. So, there
is no question of any such fear, for him. He could not purify his
evil thoughts, as he regarded these as 'mine’. To regard these as -
| one's own, is impurity. He also becomes totally free, from the
greatest fear of death, from which even great scholars cannot ~
escape. He perceives the Lord's grace, everywhere. .
Now, a doubt may arise, that when a devotee worships God
with exclusive devotion, it means that he regards himself as :
different from God and as fear arises in duality so he should be
afraid of Him. But this doubt is baseless, because the devotee 7
becomes so much intimate with the Lord, that no question arises
of his being afraid, of Him. He being the Lord's fragment, having .
taken refuge in Him, becomes fearless, forever, like a child,
who becomes fearless in the lap of his mother. He is different
from prakrti (nature), not from Him. The Lord and he (self), are -
sentient, eternal, imperishable and unchanging, while prakrti is
insentient, transient, perishable and everchanging. So he can be
afraid of nature, but not of the Lord. Actually, a devotee (self) |
has his identity with God, but he forgets it. And when he takes
refuge in the Lord, he realizes this fact.
(2) Freedom from sadness (sorrow):—A person, grieves Over
what has passed. To grieve over the past, is a blunder. A devotee,
believes that whatever is allotted, cannot be blotted, and every
action, incident or circumstance, destined by the Lord, is for his
good. By thinking so, he remains free from sadness.
(3) Freedom from worry:—When a devotee takes refuge
in God, he is_ not at all worried, about the necessities of life,
here or what will happen to him, in future. If he surrenders
himself to God, how can any worry remain? Worry is contrary
"
2084,"2034 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
to surrender. If there is worry, actually there is no surrender. The
Lord declares, ""I'll release you from all sins."" What efforts does
he need then? He is least worried, whether his mind and intellect,
are purified or not. If sometimes evil propensities, get hold of his .
mind, he may invoke the Lord to save him, but he does not, at :
all worry or grieve. He becomes a yesman of His will, because
the Lord, shoulders his full responsibility. If sometimes, he feels
that body, senses, mind, life-breath and intellect, are his, it is -
his error. He prays to God to deliver him, from this error and
becomes free from worry. ~
(4) Freedom from doubt:—He does not doubt, whether he -
is of the Lord or not, and whether the Lord has accepted him
or not. He believes, that he has been of the Lord since time :
immemorial, and he will remain His. He holds, that it was an
error on his part that he had regarded himself as separate, from ~
the Lord. But it is impossible, because the Lord declared, ""He
(the self) is a fragment of My own self"" (Gita 15/7). Thus, he
has a belief that he is of the Lord and the Lord is his, without -
doubt.
(5) Not to put to a test:—The devotee, who takes refuge ”
in the Lord, does not put his surrender to a test, that he should
possess such virtues; and if he does not possess them, it means
that he has not taken, true refuge. He has a firm belief, that he -
has taken refuge in the Lord, and so he is surprised, when he
perceives that the signs of a devotee, who is dear to the Lord
(Gita 12/13—19), are missing from him.* By thinking so, he
*In order to make the point clear there is an anecdote. At the death of
the mother, the two elder brothers asked the younger brother to take the ash
of the dead mother's body and cast it into the Ganges. The distance of the
Ganges from their house was six hundred miles. He got tired after covering
a distance of three hundred miles. So he threw the ash and filled the metal
mug with rainy water in order to show that he had gone to the Ganges and
brought its holy water. When he came back home, his elder brothers knew the
fact because he had come back earlier than he should have returned. When
they asked him, he told a lie.
Next day one of the elder brothers said to the younger brother that he
"
2085,"Verse 66] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 2035 7
develops the marks of an enlightened devotee, without making
any effort. |
- (6) Not to have a contrary resolution:—Such a devotee,
has no contrary resolution, that he is not of the Lord. He has a .
firm belief, that his relationship with the Lord is permanent and |
eternal, and he is only His. He was not conscious of this. It was
his blunder. This relationship is axiomatic. Now this blunder is
no more. So, how can he have a contrary belief? :
One who heartily accepts refuge in God, he becomes free
from evil, such as fear, grief and worry etc., and his belief in ~
surrender, is intensified automatically. :
A girl after her marriage regards her husband's house, as
her own. This relationship is so much strengthened, that when -
she becomes a grandmother or great grandmother, she almost -
forgets, that she belonged to another family. When the wife of
- her grandson or great grandson misbehaves, towards any other
member of the family, she scolds her by uttering the words, 7
that a girl born in another family has spoiled, the environment
of her family. It means, that when such an assumed affinity, is
so strengthened,why should the real affinity of a man, with the :
Lord, not be strengthened? His assumed affinity, with the world,
is the only obstacle to it.
If such a devotee, lacks anything in devotion or conduct; if :
he has contrary tendencies and his conduct is not according to
the Lord's will, there will be a feeling in his heart. God by His
had a dream in which the mother said to him that he had thrown the ash on the
way, not into the Ganges. The younger brother replied if the mother instead
of coming in this direction having covered a distance of three hundred miles,
had gone in the opposite direction, she would have reached the Ganges. ©
This anecdote shows that a devotee should not have a contrary resolution
like the younger brother who said why the mother came in the opposite direction
and if she had gone the other side, she would have reached the Ganges.
A devotee should think why he lacks the marks of an enlightened devotee
when he has taken refuge in the Lord. By thinking so he will inculcate those |
virtues (marks) and become enlightened. But if he has the contrary resolution,
he will be cheated by his own self.
"
2086,"2036 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA _ [Chapter 18 .
grace, will purge him of all sins and will make up his deficiency :
and he need not make any amends.
The Lord, perceives the feeling of 'mineness’, of a devotee
for him. He cannot behold his defects, because he is His fragment |
permanently, while defects are temporary, as these appear and
disappear. When a child, soiled with mud comes to his mother
and seeks her lap, the mother is ever prepared to put him in
her lap, without thinking whether he is dirty or clean. All this ”
happens, due to a feeling of mineness. The child, does not mind
whether it is dirty or not or whether the mother cleans it or not. ~
Instead of seeing the mud, it only beholds the mother. Draupadi .
had evil feelings of enmity and anger, for DuhSasana, and she -
resolved that she would not dress her hair, unless she stained it
with Duhsasana's blood. But as soon as she called, Lord Krsna, ;
He appeared before her, because of her closeness with Him. -
Regarding the feeling of 'mineness', one may consider (i)
'The Lord is mine’ (11) 'I am the Lord's’. In the former case a -
devotee may lay a claim over the Lord, and thus may wish
that his desires should be fulfilled by Him. But in the latter, he
surrenders himself to the Lord and thus becomes a puppet of :
His sweet will. A striver, should never lay claim on God. He
should rather accept God's lordship, over him. If the Lord does
something according to his will, he feels hesitation, that the :
Lord has to satisfy his will. If he feels satisfied and happy in
any happening according to his will, it means that there is some
deficiency, in his surrender.
Such a devout devotee, has nothing to do for him. He
has already offered himself and his possessions to the Lord,
which were really the Lord's. Whatever, he does, does only
God's work. In such a situation, even in the most adverse and
horrible circumstances, he remains enamoured of Divine grace, in
abundance. So a striver, who takes refuge in the Lord ever remains
pleased, with His will, without having any desire of his own, even :
in the most undesirable circumstances like that of KakabhuSundi.
"
2087,"Verse 66] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 2037 -
Kakabhusundi narrated the life story of his previous birth,
that he was a Brahmana, (a member of the priest class). The sage
named LomaSa put a curse, upon him. So he took birth, as a |
crow. But he was not sad, because he thought that it happened by .
Lord's will (Manasa 7/113/1). Sage Loma§Sa saw, that he was still
happy. So he called him and preached him how to meditate on
Lord Rama, because he was a loving devotee of God. Moreover,
he narrated to him the life story of Lord Rama, and gave him :
blessings, ""You will become dear to Lord Rama. You will possess —
all virtues. You will be able to transform yourself, into any form, -
you like. Your home with its surroundings will remain totally :
untouched, by any deluding potency of the Lord (Maya) and so ;
on.” Just then there was an oracle, ""O sage, whatever you have .
said will prove true, this crow is a devotee of Mine, by thought,
word and deed.” So in the Ramacaritamanasa, it is said that the -
sage's curse proved to be a blessing for it, because of adoration
and such a blessing is seldom granted, even to an ascetic.
Here, adoration stands for being pleased by the Lord's sweet ;
will, even in most unfavourable and undesirable circumstances.
The more unfavourable the circumstances, are, the more pleased, -
a devout devotee becomes, because love enhances every moment.
As a rule, if a thing is ours, it is dear to us. All the beings
are the Lord's and so they are very dear to Him (Manasa 7/86/2),
and the Lord is also naturally loving to them. But they have a
disinclination for Him, by an error regarding the kaleidoscopic
world and the bodies, as their own. Still the Lord does not
renounce them, as these are a fragment of the Lord. He ever loves
them. So, for the protection of the virtuous, for the destruction
of the wicked and for the firm establishment of righteousness,
He is born in every age (Gita 4/8). What is the Lord's own
purpose, which is served through these three objectives of His
incarnation? It is because of His love for people, that he comes
into being for their welfare. His incarnation proves His sense of
mineness, mercy, lovingness, benevolence and disinterested and -
impartial magnanimity. It is because of disinclination of beings
"
2088,"2038 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
for Him, that they have to suffer and follow the cycle of birth
and death, So the Lord, asks them to fix their mind on Him, to
be devoted to Him, to worship Him and to prostrate themselves
before Him, so that they may have an inclination for Him, and
a disinclination, for the perishable world.
Whatever the Lord designs, it is only for the welfare of all
beings. If people, pay attention to this fact, nothing remains to
be done, by them. The Lord, has a keen desire to do good, to -
beings. So He discloses the secret of all secrets. ""Abandoning
all duties, take refuge in Me alone."" The reason is, that He ~
regards Himself as a disinterested friend of all beings (5/29). :
He has given them freedom to attain Him, by anyone of the
Disciplines of Action, Knowledge or Devotion and get rid of -
worldly sufferings forever.
In fact, a being attains salvation, only by God's grace. So He
and the liberated souls, who know Him in reality, have revealed
the different disciplines—of Action, Knowledge, Devotion, -
Astangayoga, Layayoga, Hathayoga and Rajayoga etc., because
both of them think of the good of all beings, without any selfish ;
motive (Manasa 7/47/3). The Lord by His grace, by making a
striver, just an instrument, enables him to attain perfection.

_ A devout devotee, who takes refuge in the Lord, does not -
worry, that he has not yet had a vision of the Lord, he has not
developed true devotion for Him and that his inclinations have
not been purified and so on. If he worries, he is like a monkey's
young one, who by holding its mother, shoulders the responsibility
itself. A devout devotee, like a kitten, which totaly depends
upon its mother, depends on the Lord, without worrying whether
He appears before him or not, whether He bestows love upon
him or not, and whether He purifies his propensities or not. A
kitten folds its limbs and remains ready for its mother to carry
it anywhere. Similarly a devotee withdrawing himself from the
world, beholds the Lord by meditating upon Him, reciting His
name and perfoming such spiritual activities. He remains fully
"
2089,"Verse 66] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 2039 :
satisfied and happy with whatever happens to him, regarding it
as the Lord's, sweet will.
A devotee is like clay, which leaves itself to a potter's will.
The potter, mixes water in it, kneads it, crushes i, pats it, puts
it on his wheel, moulds it, and makes pots, such as pitcher, jar
and plates etc. Similarly, a devotee leaving himself at the Lord's
will, becomes free, from worry and fear etc. Then, the Lord's
grace, showers on him incessantly. The more free he is from :
worry and fears, the more Divine grace, is showered on him.
The more he is worried and prides in his capability, the more ~
impediments, he puts in, Divine grace. The Lord’s uncommon, .
unique, incessant and continuous grace, is showered on a devout
devotee, who takes refuge, in Him. -
When a fisherman casts his net, in order to catch fish, all the _
fish which come within the net, are trapped. But the fish which
come closer to his feet, is not trapped. Similarly, beings having
been attached to the world, get entangled and follow a cycle of -
birth and death. But those, who take refuge in Him, get over
the deluding potency (Maya) of the Lord (Gita 7/14). There is -
an important difference, between the attitude of the fisherman
and the Lord. The fisherman wants to trap the fish, but the Lord
wants beings to be liberated from illusion, by taking refuge in
Him. So He declares, ""Take refuge in Me, alone."" A person gets
entangled in illusion, by being attached to worldly pleasure.
As in a moving mill, all the grains are ground but which are
those near the rivet are not pulverised. Similarly in the grinding-
stone of the world, people are crushed i.e., they suffer and follow
a cycle of birth and death. But those, who take refuge in Him, -
escape suffering and the cycle of birth and death. However,
there is a difference between, grain and devotees. The grains
remain near the rivet, without making any effort, while devotees
themselves, by having a disinclination for the world, take refuge
at His feet. It means, that if a man (soul), even being a fragment
of the Lord, accepts his affinity with the world, and wants his
"
2090,"2040 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 7
desire to be fulfilled by it, he has to suffer, by following the .
cycle of birth and death. |

A man’s affinity with the world is an assumed, one, while |
with the Lord it is real. Affinity with the world makes him a
slave to the world, while the affinity with the Lord, makes him :
a Lord, even to the Lord. If a person, regards himself superior to
others, because of learning, riches, power and even renunciation
and dispassion, it means, that he is a slave to them, because in -
fact he is not superior, but these possession have made him feel
superior. So there is superiority of these possessions, rather than ~
his real own. He is inferior to them. But if a devotee takes refuge |
in the Lord, and depends only on Him, the Lord makes him a
jewel of His crown, or considers him, His Lord. But, even then -
he has no superiority complex, no pride of his virtues. In that
case, the Lord's uniqueness descends on him and sometimes even -
their bodies, senses, mind and intellect bocome divine, as their
earthliness is completely gone. Such devotees, with their bodies .
merge in God. Mirabai merged in His idol. Only a piece of her
Sari, was left in the Lord's mouth. Similarly, saint Tuka Rama
went to the Abode of Lord Visnu, with his body.

In the Discipline of Knowledge, body does not become divine,
because a Jiani (wise man), by renouncing his affinity with the
unreal, becomes established in the divine essence. But, when :
a devotee, develops an inclination for God, his body, senses,

| mind and life-breath etc., are also inclined towards the Lord. It
means, that those who behold only divine essence everywhere,
divinity descends on their bodies, though they appear as gross,
to the worldly people.

When a devotee takes refuge in the Lord, He with Goddess
Laksmi, showers on him so much of affection and grace, beyond
description. When the Lord saturated with love, comes alongwith
His consort Laksmi on His vehicle Garuda, to behold His devotee,
hymns of Samaveda are sung, by its wings. But if a devotee, ,
instead of worshipping Lord Visnu, the preserver, worships only
"
2091,"Verse 66] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 2041 -
Goddess Laksmi (the goddess of wealth), whose vehicle is an owl,
he receives wealth and is intoxicated with, pride, and then falls.
The reason is, that he looks at Mother Laksmi with deceptive
eyes, as he wants to enjoy himself, with her help. Thus, he is ;
very mean. Moreover, if a person has a desire only to obtain
wealth by adoring Her, he may not get it. But if he adores the
Lord, Goddess Laksmi also certainly appears with Her husband,
Lord Visnu and blesses him with wealth. :
In this connection, there is an anecdote of Hanuman, the
monkey-god. Once Lord Rama, Goddess Sita and devotee ~ :
Hanuman, were sitting under a tree, in a garden. A creeper /
vine, was creeping over the branches of a tree. It looked very
beautiful with its flowers and leaves. Lord Rama said to Hanuman, a
""Look, how beautiful this creeper is! It is enhancing the beauty
of the garden and specially this tree, over which it is creeping. 7
Moreover, it is because of it that beasts and birds seek shelter
under this tree. How blessed it is! Is it not so?""
Hearing praise from the Lord, Goddess Sita said, ""Dear son
Hanuman, the beauty of this creeper depends, on the tree. Its
base or support, is the tree. Where can it creep without a tree? :
So the credit for its beauty and shelter, goes only to the tree,
truly! Hanuman?""
Hanuman said, ""There is something more meritorious, than :
these two.”
""What is that?” said Sita.
Hanuman said, ""Mother, how fine the shade of the tree and
the creeper is! I relish the shade of the two"". Similarly, the Lord
and His power of bliss, enrich the glory of each other. Some
devotees consider both of them supreme, others declare only the
Lord, as supreme, while still others regard His power of bliss,
as supreme. However, for a devout devotee, refuge in both of
them, 1s desirable.
Once, a blind saint was going along the bank of the Yamuna, |
with a stick in his hand. The river was flooded. Suddenly he fell
"
2092,"2042 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 .
into the river and also lost his stick. He remembered the Lord's
declaration, pertaining to refuge. So, he surrendered himself to
the will of God. Then he felt, as if someone had pulled him out
on to the bank and provided him with a stick as well. Thus a /
devotee, is ever happy, with what God destines for him.

Once a goat got astray from its herd, at dusk. It saw the
footprint of a lion, and sat near it by taking refuge in it. When
beasts, such as jackals and wolves, etc., came to attack the goat, -
it said that it had sought refuge, at the feet of the lion. So being
afraid of a lion, all of them fled. Finally, the lion came and asked ~
why, the goat was sitting there, all alone. The goat said, that :
it had taken refuge in the lion, whose footprint was there. The

_ lion saw that it was his footprint. So he assured it, that it need .
‘not be afraid of anyone, as he would offer protection.

At night, when an elephant came to drink water, the lion ~
asked him to put the goat on his back, and feed it with green
leaves. The elephant carried out his order, and the goat, ate green ;
leaves and remained carefree.

Similarly, when a man seeks refuge in God, he gets rid of
all obstacles and becomes fearless, like the fish which swims :
against the flow of a river, while even an elephant cannot move,
in that direction.

Affinity with the Lord out of love, desire, fear and envy, :
leads a man to salvation*. But those who have no affinity with

* Not only one, but so many people out of desire, envy, fear and love by
concentrating their mind on God and being purged of the sins, have realized
God as a devotee realizes Him, through devotion. The cowherdesses, out of
desire, Karmsa out of fear, the kings such as Sisupala and Dantavaktra, out of
envy, members of the Yadu clan out of family relationship, and you (Yudhisthira .
etc.,) out of love, and we (Narada etc.,) out of devotion, have concentrated
our minds on God (Srimadbha. 7/1/29-30).

Lord Krsna says, 'O sinless Uddhava! In all the ages, by good company
i.e., affinity with Me, demons and devils, birds and beasts, celestial musicians
and damsels, snakes, perfect souls and demi-gods, have attained Me. Among
human beings, persons of trading and labour classes, women and even persons
of the lowest class, who are endowed with the mode of passion and ignorance,
have attained My Supreme State. Vrtra, Prahlada, Vrsaparva, Bali, Bana, Maya,
"
2093,"Verse 66] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 2043 .
him, but remain indifferent, are deprived of God-realization. 7
Those who take refuge in God, are dear to Him and become of
the ‘Acyuta’ (Infallible), Lord's caste and creed, though they are
of different sexes, castes, creeds, colours, calibres etc.* They
become one with Lord 'Acyuta’. So their 'Gotra’ (sub-caste), also |
_ becomes ‘Acyuta.' |
The Secret of Refuge

It is only the Lord, Who really knows the secret of refuge,
in Him. I am trying to explain this according to my own -
understanding, and request that, the reader without grasping the
deep and abstract meanings, should not take a contrary view. -
They should reflect upon the topic, because it is something
very vital and rare. | -

In the Gita, pertaining to refuge Lord Krsna has pointed -
out two factors— |

(i) ‘Seek refuge in Me alone’ (18/66). ;
Vibhisana etc., of the demon class; Sugriva, Hanuman, Jambavan etc., of the
monkey class, beasts and birds, such as the Gajendra and Jatayu. Tuladhara -
of the trading class; Dharma, a hunter, Kubja of the low caste, cowherdesses
of Vraja; wives of the people of priest class who performed sacrifices, and
other people, because of good company, have attained Me.

Those people neither studied the Vedas, nor obeyed the great personalities
as sanctioned by scriptures, nor observed any fast, nor performed any penance.
But only by good company i.e., affinity with Me, they attained Me.

*In My adoration, there is no distinction between men and women, and
between persons having different names, and belonging to different stages of
life, the only important factor is, devotion to Me (Adhyatma. Aranya 10/20).

What is the use of being born in the upper most caste (Brahmana) ? What
is the utility of the deep study of all the scriptures? It means, that there is no
utility. Who can be more blessed in the entire universe, than the being whose
heart is‘ full of devotion to God?

Was the hunter a man of good conduct? Was Dhruva aged? Did Gajendra —
(lord of elephants) possess any learning, or art? Did Vidura belong to an upper
caste ? Was Ugrasena belonging to the Yadu clan, heroic? Was Kubja beautiful ?
Was Sudama rich? No. Yet all of them realized God, because devotion is the
only virtue, which is loving to God and He gets satisfied with devotion, not .
with virtuous conduct and learning etc.
"
2094,"2044 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 7

(ii) ‘An undeluded person, knowing all worship me with his |
whole being (heart)’ (15/19); ‘Seek refuge in Him, alone with
all your being’ (18/62).

How to take refuge in Him? A devotee without paying |
any attention to His virtues, glories, names, abode, beauty and
lordliness etc., and having no desire of his own, should surrender
himself to Him. He should believe, that he is only the Lord's and
only the Lord, is his. But anyone should not assume a contrary -
meaning. The contrary implications, is that he stops listening
to the virtues and glories etc., of the Lord, and does not go to _
His birthplace etc. .

A devotee holds, that the Lord is his, whether He possesses
virtues, such as grace, beauty, glory, influence etc., or not. If the -
Lord is more hard-hearted and unkind than anyone else, in the
entire universe, still He is his.* If a person respects a rich man ~
or a powerful man, or a man holding a high post, he in fact,
does not respect him but he respects his riches or power or post.
Similarly, if a devotee adores the Lord because of His virtues, -
glories, beauty and lordliness etc., he in fact, does not adore
the Lord, but he adores those qualities. So a striver, instead of -
setting eyes on His qualities, should behold Him purely.

Seven sages went to Goddess Parvati, and described the
vices of Lord Siva, and virtues of Lord Visnu, and requested
her to renounce her affinity, with Lord Siva. In response to their
proposal she said, ""Even if Lord Siva is a sea of vices and Lord :
Visnu a sea of virtues, but anyone who has set mind on someone,
is only connected with him"" (Manasa 1/80).

A similar message was conveyed by the cowherdesses to

* My most loving Sri Krsna, whether ugly or handsome, without virtues
Or most virtuous, envious of me or most gracious to me, howsoever He treats
me, He is my only resort.

Whether He delights me by embracing or crushes me, under his feet
while I cling on to his feet or breaks my heart without appearing before me,
that Sd Krsna of the free will may treat me in anyway, He likes, but He is |
the only Lord of my life, (Siksastaka 8).

2095,"Verse 66] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 2045 -

Uddhava, when he brought Lord Krsna's message, to them. .
Those, who have an eye on the Lord's virtues and glories

etc., can attain salvation and glory etc., but cannot have vision

of God. But, a devout devotee who beholds Him only, can |

have His vision, bind Him and even sell Him. The Lord holds

such devotees in high esteem. Those, who see His glory and

influence, etc., have regard for His glory and influence, etc.,

and it shows, that they have a desire to receive something. But -

if a devotee beholds only the Lord, it means, that he has taken

refuge in Him and he 1s only the Lord's. -
An ogress named Putana, by applying poison to her teats put -

these into Lord Krsna's mouth, so that while drawing milk He

might be poisoned. But the merciful Lord, enabled her to attain .

salvation, treating her as his mother. Who can be more gracious

than He* ? He awards salvation to an ogress, who wants to poison ~

Him. How should He award His mother, who feeds Him with

milk everyday? He gives himself to her, He submits to her. When

His mother shows a stick to Him, He starts to weep. -
A devotee, who has taken refuge in the Lord, does not think

whether his body, senses and mind etc., are under his control, or -

not. He does not think of his honour, praise, virtues and conduct

etc. He does not think, that his eyes should be filled with tears,

and throat be choked with delight, when he chants the Lord's

name and glories, or listens to divine discourses. He regards all

these items as trivial. The reason, is that if he finds virtue and

characteristics of enlightened devotees (Gita 12/13—-19) in them,

he will feel proud. But, if he finds that he misses them, he will

be dejected. So a devotee, should not worry about these. But He

should not take the contrary meaning that he may bear enmity

or malice or have a possessive spirit. Divine propensities, are

naturally developed in devotees who take refuge, in God. He
* Oh! This sinful Pitana having applied the deadly poison to her teats,

wanted to feed Krsna in order to kill Him, while He awarded her salvation,

which should have been awarded to a nurse. Who can be more merciful than .

He in whom one may seek refuge (Srimadbha. 2/3/23)?
"
2096,"2046 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 .
Jooks neither at his own virtues, nor at the virtues of saints, and :
liberated souls, that he should possess these.

~ People complain, why a devotee falls ill, why he suffers, why
he becomes poor and why he is insulted and dishonoured, why
his son may expire, why his riches are lost and so on. But such
complaints or thoughts are futile. Those, who put a devotee to
such a test, do not know anything, either, about good company,
devotion or refuge. But it does not mean, that such a devotee -
is always poor, sick or is insulted, dishonoured or blamed. He
is not the least concerned with health and sickness, praise and -
blame, or honour and dishonour etc..He beholds, the Lord only. :
He does not think, even of the glory of the Lord, that He is
creator, preserver and destroyer, of the entire universe. :

Someone asked a saint, whether he was a devotee of the _
Lord, Who creates the universe, or one Who preserves it or one
Who destroys it. He replied, ""This is nothing special about our
Lord, this is a phase of His life and glory."" A devout devotee, -
should never look at His glory.

At RsikeSa, on the bank of the Ganges, a saint was holding _
a discourse, during the summer season. A cold wind out of cold
wave came to that side. A striver said, ""What a cold wind!""
Another striver said, ""How could you divert your attention to
the cold wind, from a divine discourse?"" Therefore, so long as
a striver, pays attention to these outwardly temptations etc., it
means that he is not devoted, to the Lord.

In this connection, there is an anecdote, relating to a depraved
woman. Her conduct is bad, but it teaches a good moral. She
wanted to meet her lover. On the way, there was a mosque
where a learned muslim was offering his prayer, to God. She
unknowingly put her foot on the arm of the learned person, and
went away. When she comes back, he was very angry with her,
and he scolded her by saying, that she was very foolish, as she
did not see that he was offering his prayer to God. She replied
that she was so much absorbed by her passion, for that man, that
"
2097,"Verse 66] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 2047 -
she could not see him. But, how could he behold her, when he

was engrossed in offering his prayer, to the Lord? According to

her, there was no use of such a prayer, and study of the Kurana.

He should have devoted himself, heart and soul, to the Lord, | ;
otherwise he cannot be called a devout devotee, and it means, :
that he has not taken refuge in Him.

When the Kauravas and the Pandavas, learnt archery, their
preceptor gave them, a test. An artificial bird, was perched on :
the branch of a tree. Each of them was asked to hit the throat
of the bird. But before shooting, each was asked, what he was ~
beholding. Other persons said, that they saw a branch, a bird, -
wings and the beak etc. The same question, was put to Arjuna. |
He answered that only the throat, was visible to him. So he was .
ordered to shoot the arrow. Arjuna hit the throat of the bird with
his arrow, because he saw the aim, to achieve. Thus a devotee ~
should have only the aim of Divine love. This is called unswerving
devotion (Gita 13/10) or exclusive devotion, to Him.

Someone told saint Gosvami Tulasidasa, ""Your Lord Rama,

Whom you worship, is partly divine, as He possesses only twelve

divine traits (Kala), while Lord Krsna is fully divine, as He -
possesses all the sixteen divine traits."" Having heard these words,

Gosvami Tulasidasa bowed to him and said ""You have been very

kind to me, by explaining that Lord Rama is an incarnation, having -
twelve Kalas (divine traits). I worshipped Him, regarding him

as DaSaratha's loving baby son, only."" He did not pay attention

to the fact, that Lord Krsna was a complete incarnation of God,

as He possessed all the sixteen Kalas (divine traits).

Several devotees worship Lord Rama, or Lord Krsna, ,

regarding Him as a small boy, a son of Dasaratha or Nanda. _

So they request saints, to bless their favourite Deity, boy Rama ©

or Krsna. The Lord, likes such a devotee and such a blessing,

very much. It means, that such devout devotees, do not pay any _
attention, to His glories. | | | :

If a person touches the dust of a courtyard, where Kanhaiya
"
2098,"2048 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
_ (Krsna) played, this dust enables him to attain, all the four kinds

of salvation. But mother Yasoda, regarding it as dirt, threw it

into a dustbin, because she beheld Krsna only her son, without

paying any attention to His glory and qualifications etc. |

Saints, have declared that if a person wants to have a
vision of the Lord, he should have nothing with him because
the dependence on anything, such as mind, intellect, learning, -
riches or kith and kin etc., are veils, which are obstacles to His
vision. As soon as, this veil of dependence on the material world,
is removed, a devotee beholds the Lord really. 7

Once a saint, met a rustic peasant of Vraja. The peasant said ;
that he worked only for his loving Krsna. The saint said, that
he had an exclusive devotion to him. The peasant said that he -
had the most exclusive devotion, to Him. The saint said to him, _
""What is the most exclusive devotion?"" The peasant said, ""What
is exclusive devotion?"" The saint said, that in exclusive devotion

_ adevotee has undivided devotion, to his favourite Deity, without -
worshipping the Sun-god, Ganesa, Durga and Brahma etc. The
rustic peasant said, ""O Grandpa, I have the most exclusive
devotion, because I don't know any damn name besides my 7
Kanhaiya (Krsna)."" Thus, a devout devotee, does not meditate
on, what is the Absolute, what is soul, whether God is endowed
with form and attributes or 1s without attribute and formless, |
and so on.

Once a saint, in Vraja was discussing spirituality, with ,
someone. A cowherdess, heard their discussion. She asked her
companion, about the terms God and soul etc. The latter said,
that these should be the other names of their loving Kanhaiya
(Krsna) or His neighbours, or relatives, because these saints
are bent upon attaining Him. So they always talk about Him.
Similarly, the cowherdesses also believe that only Kanhaiya is
theirs, and they are His. But they have no desire to receive,
anything from Him.

Mother Yasoda says to Dau (Balarama), the elder brother
"
2099,"Verse 66] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 2049 .
of Lord Krsna, ""Look after this Kanhaiya, because he is very .
innocent. He should not go into dense woods etc.” Balarama
replies, ""Kanhaiya is very carefree. He puts his hand into the
holes of snakes and does such other mischiefs. He may be bitten
by poisonous snakes etc."" So Balarama and other cowherds, look |
after Kanhaiya, lest he should do any mischief. They do not
believe, when anyone says that He rears and preserves the entire
world, because according to them, He is only a loving kid. -
Once, a saint began to narrate the glories of Lord Krsna,
to the cowherdesses, while talking to them. The cowherdesses -
said, ""The key of the treasure of His glories is with us. He has
nothing. So how can he grant anything to anyone?"" Anyone
who nurses any desire should never approach Him. So, one who
wants nothing from Him, even in adversity or at the time of :
death, should go to Him. : ~
Sage Valmiki says to Lord Rama in the Ramacaritamanasa,
""You reside in the heart of a person who loves, You, naturally | ;
without expecting any reward, because that 1s Your own seat"" (2/13).
When a devotee has no desire of his own, the Lord, becomes
loving to him and He resides in him. A devout devotee, loves 7
him for His sake, not for his own sake. If he loves Him, to get
his desire fulfilled, it means that there is no true love, there 1s
attachment, lust or delusion. Therefore, the cowherdesses gave a .
warning to travellers, say, ""O travellers, do not go by that street,
because that is very deadly and dangerous. There a naked boy,
having a dark complexion like black catechu tree, is standing
with his hands on his buttocks. In appearance, he is like an
ascetic, but he robs travellers, of the treasure of their hearts, .
without any exception”. , |
_ He ts called Krsna, because He attracts everyone towards
Him. One who is attracted towards Him, becomes His forever —
and he remains of no use to anybody in the world. Such a man,
who is of no use to anybody, is really useful to, everyone. But,
he has no self-interest, to be served by anyone. When a devotee
"
2100,"2050 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 .
takes refuge in Him, he has not to adore Him. Adoration like |
breathing, becomes a natural part and parcel of his life. A devotee,

- cannot forget Him, he becomes restless, without remembering
Him, even for a moment (Naradabhaktisutra 19). Such a noble
devotee, shuns the Kingdom of the entire universe which if |
offered to him, as a substitute for forgetfulness of the Lord, for
even a fraction of a moment (Srimadbhi. 11/14/14).

In the Bhagavata it is mentioned—Excellent devotees, are
those who cannot renounce the Lord's lotus feet, which are
scarcely available to the gods, not even for half a moment -
(Srimadbhagavata 11/2/53).

It is declared by Lord Krsna in the Bhagavata, “Devotees
who have surrendered themselves to Me, have no desire to attain -
the seat, either of Brahma or Indra (the lord of the gods), or the
kingdom of this world, or the underworld or all yogic perfection ~
or even salvation,"" (Srimadbhagavata 11/14/14).

Bharata, the brother of Lord Rama also declares in the -
Ramacaritamanasa, that he has no desire, either for nches or
for righteousness, or for lust or even for salvation, but he wants
to be blessed with the boon, that he should love (adore) Lord ""
Rama's feet, in all births (2/204).

Appendix—A Karmayogi has his ‘nitya’ (eternal) affinity with
God, a Jnanayogi has Tattvika unity, while the devotee, who has
taken refuge in God, has ‘atmiya affinity’, ownness with God. In
‘nitya’ affinity there is renunciation of the transient relationship
with the world; in ‘tattvika’ unity there is realization of the Self
(Self-realization); and in ‘atmiya’ affinity there 1s oneness with
God. In ‘nitya’ affinity there is “Santa rasa’ (peaceful relish or
bliss); in ‘tattvika’ unity there is ‘akhanda rasa’ and in ‘atmiya’
affinity there is infinite relish (bliss). Without attaining infinite
relish, a man’s hunger is not fully satisfied. The infinite relish can
be attained by taking ‘refuge’ in God. Therefore ‘seeking refuge
in God’ is the Supreme Secret and the best spiritual discipline. :

‘Sarvadharmanparityajya’ does not mean physical abandonment
"
2101,"Verse 66] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 2051 .
of all duties but it means abandonment of dependence on all /
duties. Thus a striver should not depend on duties. As in the first
chapter, it is mentioned ‘ta ime’vasthita yuddhe pranamstyaktva
dhanani ca’—here ‘pranarhstyaktva’ does not mean abandonment
of lives but it means abandonment of the desire to live because |
by abandoning the life, how will a warrior be arrayed on the
battlefield? It is impossible. Similarly in the ninth verse of the
first chapter, it is mentioned—‘anye ca bahavah Surva madarthe -
tyaktajivitah’—it does not mean that many other heroes are
arrayed by abandoning their lives. It means that those heroes _
have given up hope to live alive viz., they don’t care for their |
lives. Therefore here the expression ‘sarvadharmanparityajya’ :
should mean ‘abandonment of dependence on duties’. As
heroes don’t care for their lives, similarly devotees don’t care -
for duties. They don’t attach importance to duties. The reason _
is that they attach more importance to ‘refuge in God’ than to
duties. In duty there is connection with the insentient, while in
‘refuge’ there is affinity with the sentient. The duty is discharged -
according to one’s ‘varna’ (order of life) and “asrama’ (stage
of life), therefore in it there is significance of the body. But _
a devotee takes refuge in God himself, therefore in it there is
significance of God.
*“Mamekarh Saranam vraja’—In mundane life a devotee
should have fair dealings with love, respect and courtesy with
others but as he needs nothing from others, he does not depend
on anyone else but he totally depends on God only.
yaha binati raghubira gusaim
aura 4sa-bisvasa-bharoso, harau jiva-jadatal
(Vinayapatrika 103)
‘O Lord Rama! I pray to you to free me from the stupidity
of my hope, belief and dependence on the matter (world)’.
eka bharoso eka bala eka 4sa_bisvasa
eka rama ghana syama hita cataka tulsidasa |
(Dohavali 277)
"
2102,"2052 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 _
“As a ‘cataka’ bird lives only on rain drops (it does not 7
drink even Ganges-water), similarly Tulasidasaji wants to have
trust, hope and belief only in Lord Rama and he wants to depend |
only on His power.” |
In fact only God grants full refuge. As a baby raises its hand .
to go to the lap of its mother, the mother raises it up by catching
its hand, similarly when a devotee, by applying his power, is
inclined to God and prepares himself for taking refuge in Him, -
God grants him full refuge.

_ Arjuna wanted to get rid of sins, therefore the Lord said _
that He would liberate him from all sins because it is God’s
nature that howsoever a devotee seeks Him, so does He meet -
him—‘ye yatha marh prapadyante tarmstathaiva bhajamyaham’

(Gita 4/11). In fact liberation from sins is not the fruit of refuge. :
By exclusive refuge a man being inseparable with God, can attain -
infinite bliss. Therefore a striver, without having the desire to be
liberated from sins or sufferings, should take refuge in God. If a
striver has some desire, he gets something (perishable) but if he -
is totally free from desire, he gets all (imperishable or endless).
God offers Himself to the devotee, becomes submissive to him -
who takes refuge in Him and feels indebted to him.

This refuge is the gist of the Gita which the Lord has
related by showering His special grace. In this ‘refuge’ only,
the gospel of the Gita attains perfection. Without it the gospel
of the Gita would have remained incomplete. Therefore when
Arjuna surrendered himself totally to God, by declaring, that
he would act according to the Lord’s bidding ‘karisye vacanarn
tava’, after that the Lord did not sermonize.

the supreme secret gospel of all the other secrets, as mentioned
in the preceding verse, to those who are undeserving.

: idam te natapaskaya nabhaktaya kadacana
na casuSsriisave vacyam na ca mam yo'bhyasiyati
This is never to be mentioned by you, to anyone who performs
no austerities, or has no devotion, nor who is unwilling to hear, or -
who finds fault with Me. 67
Comment:—
""Idam te natapaskaya'—Here, the term ‘idarn' (this), stands ~
for the supreme secret ‘abandoning all duties, take refuge in Me,
alone’ unfolded in the preceding verse. _
Austerity, consists in tolerating pain and unfavourable
circumstance, happily, while performing one's duty. The mind -
is not purified without austerity, and without purity useful advice -
cannot be accepted. So the Lord declares, that this supreme secret
of all secrets, should not be revealed to a person, who is devoid ~
of austerity. This secret of all secrets, should not be unfolded
, to one, who is devoid of austerities 1.e., who is intolerant. This -
tolerance is of four kinds:— |
(1) Tolerance in the pairs of opposites:—He should be free,
from the pairs of opposites, such as attachment and aversion, :
pleasure and pain, honour and dishonour, praise and blame etc.
Men of virtuous deeds are free from delusion, in the shape of ;
pairs of opposites (Gita 7/28); ""The undeluded ones, are free, from
the pairs of opposites, known as pleasure and pain"" (15/5).
(2) Tolerance of impulses:— One resists impulses of lust,
anger, greed and aversion, etc., (Gita 5/23).
(3) Tolerance for religions (doctrines) of others:—- He does
not doubt his own doctrine, nor does he criticize and condemn, the
doctrines of others. He realises, that the discipline of renunciation
and of action, are one (Gita 5/5). |
(4) Tolerance, in the progress of others:—He is not jealous
and envious of others, when they progress or when they are
praised and honoured (Gita 4/22, 12/15). ,
"
2104,"2054 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
A perfected soul, possesses these four kinds, of tolerance.
One who aims at these, is austere, while he who does not aim |
at them, is not austere.
This most profound secret, should not be unfolded to one,
who is not austere, because he will not believe it, and he will
find fault with it and thus have a downfall. Secondly, a man
whose aim is not to purify his propensities, conduct etc., may -
think that he need not grieve, because the Lord will liberate him,
from all sins. By thinking so, he may be indulging in evil and _
may have a fall. So, the Lord directs Arjuna, not to impart this |
secret gospel to one, who is devoid of austerities, otherwise, he -
may misuse it. :
'Nabhaktaya kadacana'—He, who is devoid of devotion and
has no faith in God, should not be imparted this supreme secret, ~
because he may see things in a perverted way (contrary to the
truth), by thinking that the Lord brags, Who wants others to ;
carry out His order, for His selfish motive. Such an unbeliever
by belittling such teachings, would have a downfall. So this
supreme gospel, should not be conveyed to such a man. ""
'Na casusriisave vacyam’'—This supreme gospel, should not
be imparted to one, who is unwilling to listen to it, because he
will turn a deaf ear, to it. Thus, he will commit a sin, which .
will be harmful for him.
‘Na ca mar yo'bhyasiyati'—This most secret teaching, should
not be imparted to one who finds fault with Him. He finds fault
because his heart is very impure. By finding fault with him, he
is deprived of the gain and rather has a downfall. This defect is
sometimes, found even in devotees, who have faith in God. So
strivers, should be aware of this defect. Such men who are free
from criticism, are released from the bondage of actions (Gita
3/31). Moreover, He also declares that a man who listens to this —
gospel with faith, being free from cavil, shall attain to the divine
immortal abodes such as Vaikuntha, Goloka etc., (Gita 18/71).
"
2105,"Verse 68] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 2055 -
When the Lord declares, that this supreme secret is not to be
spoken to such a person, He does not want him to be deprived
of this gospel. But he, without having faith in the Lord and
His words, may regard Him, as boastful and selfish and thus -
by accusing Him may have a fall. So it should not be spoken,
to such a person.
Appendix—The Lord has laid special emphasis on the _
point that the Supreme Secret word should not be mentioned to
anyone who has no devotion or who finds fault with Him. If it
is mentioned to anyone who has no devotion or finds fault with -
God, it is more blame worthy than if it 1s related to one who
performs no austerities or who is unwilling to hear, because the
intellect of the people, who are without devotion and who are -
of a fault finding nature, is perverted. 7 -
‘Abhakta’ means the person who opposes devotion. He,
who lacks devotion, has not been called here ‘abhakta’. Even
in devotees, out of ignorance, this defect of fault-finding :
can be perceived* but because of devotion this defect
naturally perishes. -
*Asusrisave’ means the person, who is unwilling to hear,
out of egoism. He who, out of ignorance, is unwilling to hear,
has not been called ‘aSusrisave’ here. : :

ya imam paramam guhyam madbhaktesvabhidhasyati
bhaktim mayi param krtva mamevaisyatyasamSayah
- He who, with supreme devotion to Me teaches this supreme
secret to My devotees, shall doubtless, come to Me alone. There
is no doubt about it. 68
Comment:—
‘Bhaktim mayi param krtva'—The supreme devotion means ""
that the person does not impart this gospel of the Gita, in order
to receive praise, honour, fame and gifts etc. But his aim is to -
develop devotion to Him, to meditate on Him, to propagate His :
teachings, to liberate the people, from sorrow and suffering and
to lead them, to salvation. -
There is a difference between the devotion mentioned in _
the fifty-fourth verse of this chapter, and in this verse. There, a
Sankhyayogi having become one with Brahma (the Absolute),
attains supreme devotion to the Lord ie., he realizes his real -
affinity with God, which he has had since time immemorial. But
here, a striver without having any worldly desire, for praise and .
honour etc., in the least, yearns for devotion to Him.
'Ya imam paramam guhyarm'—The teaching of the Gita as
imparted in the whole Gita, in the form of a dialogue between °
_ Lord Krsna and Arjuna, is the supreme secret. The expression
‘Supreme secret, also includes whatever is secret or more secret,
or the most secret.
""Madbhaktesvabhidhasyati'—A devotee, is he who has faith
in the Lord and His words and who wants to listen to His
teaching. One who declares this teaching to His such devotees,
attains Him.
In the preceding verse, in the expression 'Nabhaktaya'—singular
number was used, while here in 'Madbhaktesu'—plural number has
been used. Why? The reason is, that if there is only one person,
who is devoid of austerities or devotion or who is unwilling to
"
2107,"Verse 69] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 2057 .
hear or who cavils, among many others, the speaker, should -
impart the gospel of the Gita, because it will be beneficial to all

of them, except one. When a man feeds sparrows with grains,
sometimes even a crow comes, to pick some grains, though

the man wants to feed the sparrows only. Similarly, a preacher
(speaker) imparts the teaching of the Gita only to those, who

are qualified and deserving to listen, to it.

_ ""MamevaisyatyasarnSayah'—If a person, teaches this supreme -
secret to His devotees, aiming at God-realization, he will |
doubtlessly, attain Him. The reason is, that according to Gita ~
when a man, worshipping Him through the performance of his .
own duty, attains perfection (18/46) and also through the offer of
bodily actions attains, Him (9/27-28); why should he not attain -
Him by propagating the gospel of the Gita, having an aim of _
supreme devotion to Him? |

There is, none among men who does more loving service to
Me than he; nor shall there be, another on earth, dearer to Me
than him. 69
Comment:— |
""Na ca tasmanmanusyesu kaScinme priyakrttamah'—A person,
who wants to receive and secure material things, and attaches
importance to them, cannot be said, to be endowed with supreme
devotion. But he, who without having any desire in the least for
mundane things etc., having only the aim of God-realization or
God's vision, or God's devotion, wants to translate the teachings
of the Gita into practice, can be said to be endowed, with supreme
"
2108,"2058 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18
devotion. Such a person, is qualified to propagate the gospel of
the Gita. If sometimes, he happens to have a desire to receive
honour and praise etc., that desire cannot last much longer,
because it is not his aim. |
There is, none dearer to Him, than he who propagates the |
gospel of the Gita among men, because there is no other job more
loving, to Him, than propagation of this gospel. Moreover, he :
- does so only for the Lord's sake, without expecting any reward,
in the form of praise, honour, name and fame etc. As far as,
mundane desires are concerned, they can be satisfied, in other -
births, such as of gods, birds, beasts, insects, trees, plants and -
creatures of hell also. But the success of human life, lies in
God-realization and in becoming beloved, of Him. -
'Bhavita na ca me tasmadanyah priyataro bhuvi'—A devotee, -
who has some desire to win praise, honour, name and fame,
without having the only aim of God-realization and without
practising the teachings of the Gita, but propagates the gospel of -
the Gita, through adoration, recitation, publication, memorization
and cheap sale and getting these done by others, is dearer to the -
Lord, while he who propagates the teaching of his own sect or
religion, is only dear to Him.
A striver, can translate most of the teaching of the Gita into ;
practice, very easily. Every person, without any distinction of
caste, creed, colour, country, stage of life etc., who performs
his duty for the welfare of others without expecting any reward,
and without having any desire, while performing professional
and physical activities (eating, drinking, sleeping etc.) can attain
God-realization and supreme bliss (Gita 6/22).
The gospel of the Gita, does not force anyone to change
his caste, creed, colour, country and actions etc. But, it imparts
the teachings that a man should purify his thoughts, sentiments
and aim. A person, by imparting the gospel of the Gita to His :
devotees, will remove their doubts and obstacles, and enable
"
2109,"Verse 70] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 2059 -
them to realize God, easily and quickly. So, such a person will :
be most loving to God, because He is very much pleased with
those people, who help others in realizing Him. The Lord, feels
very happy and satisfied, with salvation of human beings.
Appendix—The gospel of the Gita can easily lead every |
person under every circumstance to salvation; therefore the
Lord mentions the special glory of its propagation. The Gita
declares that even a warrior, while fighting in the war, can attain -
salvation by treating pleasure and pain alike—‘sukha duhkhe same
krtva’ (2/38), by dedicating this action of fighting to God—‘yat ~
karosi yadasnasi’ (9/27) and by worshipping the Lord through
the performance of his duty—‘svakarmana tamabhyarcya’ (18/46)
and so on. When even such a circumstance (horrid action) as _
war can lead to salvation, then how will other circumstances
not lead to salvation? -
The man, who becomes loving to God, attains the three
Yogas—-Karmayoga, Jnanayoga and Bhaktiyoga. 7

Comment:— |
‘Adhyesyate ca ya imam dharmyam samvadamavayoh'— Lord
Krsna says to Arjuna, that this dialogue is the gist of scriptures.
"
2110,"2060 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 :
Though they had been living together for years, yet they could |
not have such a rare dialogue. This sort of dialogue takes place
on rare occasions.
Real curiosity, is not aroused, so long as a man does not
get disenchanted of mundane affairs, and is not dispassionate.
‘When he becomes restless, in the mundane maze, to find out
the way, he has a heart-to-heart talk with a person, from whom
he expects right guidance. He becomes his pupil, takes refuge -
in him and puts questions to him freely. |
The more curious a pupil is, to satisfy his curiosity, the more -
enthusiastic the preceptor is to satisfy it, with new explanations
and arguments. When a cow feeds a calf with her milk, the
more hungry the calf is, with more force he pulls the udders -
and so the whole milk of the cow comes to her udders, from
other areas. Similarly, when an inquisitive striver, asks questions -
again and again, new ideas and answers crop up, in the mind
of the speaker. Then, a dialogue between the speaker and the -
listener, becomes excellent.
The real dialogue, between Lord Krsna and Arjuna, begins ;
with 2/54 when Arjuna curiously asks Him ""What are the marks
of the man, who has steady wisdom?"" Before this, Arjuna
never asked a question with such curiosity, nor did the Lord
SO spontaneously express His views, before. This dialogue is
the gist of the Vedas and the scriptures. It can lead a man to
salvation, very easily, even in the most adverse circumstances, if
he translates this gospel into practice. In adverse circumstances, he
instead, of losing heart should make the best possible use 1.e., he
should renounce, the desire for favourable circumstances, because
unfavourable circumstances destroy his sins, and enable him to
renounce desire, for desirable circumstances. The more desire, a
man has for favourable circumstances, the more fearful are the
unfavourable circumstances. As soon as, he starts renouncing his |
desire for desirable circumstances by degrees, to that extent his
"
2111,"Verse 70] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 2061 :
attachment to the agreeable will be renounced, and his fear of ""
the disagreeable, will perish. When he becomes totally free from
attachment and fear, he will become equanimous. This equanimity,

has been called Yoga and those who are established in equanimity, _ )
are established in God. In the Gita, different disciplines, as of

action, of knowledge, of Devotion, of Meditation, as means to

realize God, have been described.

The term 'Adhyesyate' (will study), denotes that the one who -
studies the dialogue, in the form of the Gita, learns it by heart, 7
tries to understand its gospel, will develop a curiosity to know -
this gospel, more and more. The more curious he is, the more :
clearly, it will be unfolded to him. When its secret is revealed to
him, he will translate it into practice. By thoroughly practising :
its teachings, he will become the very image of the Gita. By
seeing him, people will be reminded of the Gita, in the same way -
as people of Ayodhya, were reminded of Laksmana, by seeing
Guha, the chief (king), of the primitive tribe called 'Nisada’. -

‘Jiianayajfiena tenadhamistah syam'—Sacrifice is of two
kinds—of wealth and of knowledge. In the former, there is :
predominance of things and actions, while in the latter, there is
predominance of knowledge. In the sacrifice of knowledge, a
striver, puts questions to a saint or a preceptor, in order to know |
the real essence, and the saint or preceptor explains it. A striver,
reflects seriously upon it. Then he realizes, where he stands.

Having known the real essence, nothing remains to be known

by him. This is called the sacrifice of knowledge. But here, Lord

Krsna says to Arjuna, that He will be worshipped through the
sacrifice of knowledge, by him who studies this secret dialogue, |
between them. The reason is, as a loving devotee is pleased and
thrilled, when he is reminded of the Lord by someone, similarly,

when the Lord sees anyone studying the Gita, He is reminded of

his devotee, having exclusive devotion to Him, and the teaching
imparted by him to others. So he gets pleased, and thrilled and
"
2112,"2062 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
by assuming this study, as the sacrifice of knowledge, He is |
worshipped. By studying this gospel, knowledge, specially wells

forth, in his mind. :

‘Iti me matih'—When the Lord declares, that it is His :
conviction, He means to say that, He listens to the gospel of the
Gita, when anyone studies it, because He pervades everywhere
(Gita 9/4) and His ears are everywhere (Gita 13/13). Having
heard this gospel, He is overwhelmed with knowledge, love :
and grace, and His intellect, is immersed in his memory. Thus,
though he does not worship Him, he merely studies the Gita, yet a
He accepts it as worship to Him, i.e., He by His grace awards :
him, the fruit of the sacrifice of knowledge.

Secondly, while one studies the Gita or learns it by heart, :
he has a sweet memory of this dialogue, so He assumes, that _
he is rendering a great service, to Him.

Once, a boy was brought by a priest. The priest had trained
him in the art of oration, and had given him a written speech. -
The boy had learnt it by heart. When the boy delivered the
speech, with right gestures and expressions, the chairman and
the audience were so much pleased with him, that they showered
money on him and congratulated him from their hearts. But in
fact, that boy did not understand the subject matter of the speech, °
as he was not well educated. He had merely learnt it by heart,
without understanding it. Similarly, when a person recites the
verses of the Gita, even without understanding these, the Lord is
worshipped through the sacrifice of knowledge, because the Lord
understands them well,.in the same way, as the chairman and
the audience understood, the speech of the boy. Moreover, He
Himself resides at such a place; and as an audience was present
at the speech of the boy, at the place, where Gita is studied, all
sacred-places (places of pilgrimage), such as Prayaga etc., as
well as gods, sages, divine snakes, cowherds, cowherdesses and
ascetics, such as Narada and Uddhava etc., also reside there.

Comment:—
'Sraddhavananasiyasca Srnuyadapi yo narah so'pi muktah
Subhallokanprapnuyatpunyakarmanam'— Sraddhavan’, is he who
has faith in the Gita and holds it in reverence while 'Anasuyah’,
is he who does not find fault with the Lord or His utterance, in
the least. Such a person who listens to the gospel of the Gita,
with faith and without finding fault, with it, being liberated from
all sins, attains to the worlds of the righteous.
The Lord, by using the term ‘Api’, twice means to say, that
not to talk of the person who propagates and studies the Gita,
even he who listens to it, being liberated from sins, attains to
the happy world of the righteous. |
In a man's speech, generally there are four defects. These
are—doubt, heedlessness, desire and incapability. But the Lord's :
gospel, is totally free from all these defects, because the Lord is
"
2114,"2064 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 .
the ultimate purity, where there is not even an iota of impurity.
Therefore, there is no possibility of any doubt, in this gospel.
If any person, is unable to understand this gospel, or he doubts
any fact, he should think that he is unable to have a thorough
grasp of the subject, because of his imperfect intellect. By having
such a belief, his critical attitude comes to an end. Devotion with
faith, also destroys a critical state of mind. |

There was a disciple of Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who while Oo
studying the Gita, got so much engrossed in it, that sometimes
there was a burst of laughter, while at the next moment there -
was a burst of tears, in him. But his pronunciation, was not ,
correct. Someone complained to Caitanya Mahaprabhu, that his
disciple was a hypocrite, as he shed tears while studying the Gita, -
though he could not pronounce the verses correctly. Caitanya -
Mahaprabhu asked the disciple, ""Do you understand the verse,
while studying the Gita?"" He said, “No”. ""Then why do you
burst into tears?"" He replied, ""When I study the Gita, I behold 7
Lord Krsna and his devotee, Arjuna sitting and talking. So I am
overwhelmed with emotions, by beholding them and _ listening -
to their dialogue."" Hearing his answer, Caitanya Mahaprabhu
was very much pleased, with him. If such a devotee, listens to
the gospel of the Gita with faith, he attains salvation, without :
any doubt. He being liberated from all sins, attains, to the happy
worlds of the righteous. |

Here, the expression 'Punyakarmanam’, does not stand for
those righteous persons, who perform righteous deeds, such as
sacrifice etc., to receive their fruit, because they have to return to
the world of mortals (Gita 9/21), again and again. Here, persons
of righteous deeds, are those devotees who attain to Vaikuntha,
the Abode of Lord Visnu; Saketa, the Abode of Lord Rama;
Goloka, the Abode of Lord Krsna; Kailasa, the Abode of Lord
Siva, according to the worship, of their favourite Deity. All of ,
them realize, God merely by listening to the gospel of the Gita,
"
2115,"Verse 71] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 2065 -
with faith and without derision.
Appendix—‘Subharhllokanprapnuyatpunyakarmanam’—The
listener who listens to the gospel of the Gita with faith and
devotion becomes authorized to attain to the higher worlds such :
as heaven and even to the Abode of God, viz., if he is endowed
with more faith and devotion, he will attain to the Abode of
God; and if he has less faith and devotion, he will attain to -
other worlds. : |
Not to speak of the study of the Gita and listening to it, but —
there is a great glory of even having a copy of the Gita. There :
was a constable who was going home at night. On his way he
saw a beautiful lady under a tree in the moon light. He talked :
to that woman, that woman asked him, if she could accompany
him. He consented and so the woman, who was indeed a witch, -
followed him. That witch daily at night came to him, slept with
him, had sensual intercourse with him and departed in the next -
moming. Thus she began to exploit that constable viz., began to
suck his blood and so he became very weak. One night when
they were lying in bed, he asked her to switch off the light. She :
while lying, by lengthening her arm, switched off the light. So
the constable came to know that she was not a common woman
but she was a witch. He was much frightened. The witch warned .
him that, if he disclosed her identity to anyone, she would kill
him. Thus she came daily at night and went back in the morning.
He was reduced to a skeleton. The other people asked him the
_ reason of his weakness and thinness. But being frightened of the
witch, he did not disclose the secret. One day he brought some
medicine from a shop. The shopkeeper (chemist) gave him the
medicine in a small paper packet. The constable put the packet
into his pocket and came back home. At night when the witch
came to him, she remained standing at a distance and asked
the constable to throw the paper packet from his pocket down. |
The constable believed that there was some miracle in the paper
"
2116,"2066 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 :
packet, so the witch did not dare to come to him. The constable .
bluntly refused to throw the packet. The witch insisted on it
again and again but the constable didn’t agree to her proposal.
When she thought that he was beyond her control, she went
away. The constable took out the paper packet and saw that it
was a torn piece of paper of the Gita. Since then the constable, _
having known the glory of the Gita, began to keep the Gita in ;
his pocket every time. That witch never came to him again.

preceding verse, the Lord, in order to reveal the significance of
the hearing of the Gita, to all the person, puts Arjuna a question, -
in the next verse, although He knew everything.

O Partha (Arjuna), has this been heard by you with one-pointed
mind? O winner of wealth (Arjuna), has your delusion, born of
ignorance, been destroyed? 72 |
Comment:—
'Kaccidetacchrutam partha tvayaikagrena cetasa'—The term,
‘etat' (this) denotes much nearness. So Lord Krsna asks Arjuna,
whether he has heard what He explained, in the seventy-first
verse, that a man should listen to the gospel of the Gita with faith
and without derision. The Lord means to say, whether he has
listened to this gospel with faith, and with an uncarping spirit.
By the expression 'Ekagrena cetasa’, the Lord means to
ask Arjuna, whether he has listened to His supreme word, the
most secret of all of taking refuge in Him alone, (18/66), which |
was promised by Him, in the sixty-fourth verse and which was
"
2117,"Verse 73] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 2067 -
forbidden for one, who is devoid of austerities, in the sixty-
seventh verse.
_ ‘Kaccidajfiianasammohah pranastaste dhanajijaya'—Lord
Krsna puts the second question to Arjuna, whether his delusion,
born of ignorance, has been destroyed. If his delusion has been
destroyed, it means that he listened to the gospel preached by Him,
otherwise not, as it is a fact, that the delusion of a person who -
listens to this gospel with faith and without scoffing, is dispelled.

Lord Krsna addresses Arjuna, by the term ‘Partha’ (son of -
Prtha viz., Kuntt), in order to show His affection for him. He
addressed him, by this term in the twenty-fifth verse of the
first chapter, when He asked him to behold all the kinsmen, to -
arouse the delusion of kinship, and to make him restless, to be
free from this delusion. So Lord Krsna here again, addresses -
him as ‘Partha’, to ask him whether his delusion of kinship has
been destroyed. 7 | -

By using the term ‘Dhananjaya, Lord Krsna says to Arjuna,
that he is called the conqueror of wealth, by conquering the .
wealth of kings. But real wealth, consists in the destruction of
delusion. So he should become a conqueror of wealth, in the
real sense of the term. | |

Arjuna Said:
O Acyuta (Krsna), my delusion is destroyed and memory is
gained through Your grace. I stand firm, with my doubts dispelled
and I shall act, according to Your word. 73 , ""
Comment:—
'Nasto mohah smrtirlabdha tvatprasadanmayacyuta'—Arjuna
addresses the Lord as 'Acyuta', to emphasize the fact that, He ”
never deviates from His divine nature, while a man turns away
from one's own Self and has a fall. The term 'Acyuta’, has been -
used three times in the Gita by Arjuna. First (in 1/21), he asked /
him to place his chariot between the two armies. Second, (in 11/
42) he prayed to His cosmic form. There was no change in His -
state. At last (in 18/73) he uses this term here, when he says that
he will act according to His word. Thus there are three kinds of -
states of mind, of Arjuna at the beginning, the middle and the end,
but the Lord remains the same, without any change, in his state. _
In the second chapter, Arjuna surrendered himself to the Lord
by declaring, ""I am your disciple. Do instruct me, who have taken -
refuge in you"" (2/7). In. this verse, that refuge, attains perfection.
At the end of the tenth chapter, Lord Krsna said to Arjuna,
“What need is there for detailed knowledge? I stand supporting
the whole universe, with a single fragment of Myself."" Having
heard this declaration, Arjuna could realise the Lord's singularity
and received a kind of enlightenment, which forced Arjuna to
utter the words, ""My delusion has been dispelled"" (Gita 11/1).
But having seen the fearful cosmic form of the Lord, when
Arjuna was confounded with fear, He asked him, neither to be
afraid nor bewildered (11/49). It proves, that Arjuna's delusion,
was not destroyed by then. But, here in response to Lord Krsna's
question, Arjuna answers that his delusion is destroyed, and he
has gained knowledge (memory).*
*Here Arjuna's both kinds of delusion— the mundane (Gita 2/52) and
Vedic textual (Gita 2/53) have been destroyed.
"
2119,"Verse 73] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 2069 -
There is a vast difference, between the memory of the mind
and that of the self. The reality of a thing is established through
the proof of senses and mind, while the existence of God cannot
be established, through this proof i.e., God cannot be confined /
within the range of the proof of senses and mind.* God is beyond
all proofs. But the entire universe, is within the sphere of proof,
while proof comes within the sphere, of the knower. -
The knower is one, while proof can be of different kinds.
Some scholars regard proof (Pramana) of three kinds—evident, ~
by guess, and of the vedas, while others regard it as of four °
kinds—evident (Pratyaksa), by guess (Anumana), that with
which something is compared (Upamana), and word (Sabda), -
while some others besides these four, regard it of three more
kinds—reasoning (Arthapatti), in apprehension (Anupalabdhi)
and traditional theory (Aitihya). Thus scholars, differ in their
opinions, as far as kinds of proof are concerned, but all of them _
agree, that the knower, is one. Proof is a kind of inclination,
while the knower (self), is a kind of realization.
As far as the term 'smrti' (memory), is concerned, it has
been explained—(1) The revelation of something already
experienced. (2) Memory means the knowledge born of past
influences (impressions), Sarnskaras.
* We can know the world through (proof). But God Who is the base
and illuminator of knowledge, cannot be known by knowledge, because the
illumined cannot illuminate the illuminator. So He can be known by having
faith in Him.
Those who have faith in scriptures, accept the existence of God, by
regarding these as authority, while those who have faith in the liberated souls,
accept His existence according to their word. But the mind and senses, cannot
prove His existence. Therefore, the believers believe in his existence, through
scnptures and liberated souls, by having faith in them while the non-believers
cannot accept the existence of God, by regarding scriptures and liberated souls
as authority. It means, that whatever is known through senses and mind, is |
direct proof, while the proof of assumption etc., is the argumentative proof,
the progenitor of direct proof. But as far as, proof of saints and scriptures is
concemed, that can be gained, through faith.
"
2120,"2070 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -

This memory, is an inclination of mind. This inclination, can
be of five kinds—proof (Pramana), error (Viparyaya), alternate
(Vikalpa), sleep (Nidra) and memory (Smrti), and each of these
kinds can further be subdivided into two parts—difficult and easy. ,
Inclination for the world, is difficult i.e., it binds a man, while
inclination for the Lord is easy, as it frees a man, from bondage
and suffering. Ignorance, is the cause of these inclinations. But ;
the Lord is free, from ignorance. So He can be known by the
self, not by any inclination or cause. When his memory is once
gained, He can never be forgotten, while in the inclination of -
mind there is sometimes memory, while at the other time, there -
is forgetfulness.

A man, forgets the Lord when he accepts the existence of -
the unreal world, and attaches importance to it. Though this -
forgetfulness, has been since time immemorial, yet it comes to
an end. When it comes to an end, the memory of one's self, is
aroused which is called 'Smrtirlabdha’' i.e., the veil is removed, -
and the reality is revealed. ,

This memory, according to the inclination (taste) of strivers, ""
can be divided into three kinds—{1) Discipline of Action i.e.,
memory of the performance of action, without expecting any
reward. (2) Discipline of Knowledge i.e., memory of the self. :
(3) Discipline of Devotion 1.e., memory of one's relationship,
with God. Thus the memory of these three disciplines is aroused,
because though all the three disciplines, are self-evident and
eternal, a man forgets them.

When a man, accepts the existence of worldly things and
attaches importance to them, he is attached to them—this is
forgetfulness (veil) of the Discipline of Action. When he is
attached to the unreal, he has a disinclination for the self—this
is forgetfulness of the Discipline of knowledge. The man (self),
is a fragment of God. But he, having a disinclination for God, has |
an inclination for the world, and is attached to it. It is because of
"
2121,"Verse 73] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 2071 7
this attachment, that his devotion is veiled—this is forgetfulness,
of the Discipline of Devotion.

Here, destruction of forgetfulness (disinclination) for the self
is smrti (memory). This gaining of memory (knowledge), of the ,
self is real memory, which when once gained, cannot be lost,
because the self ever remains uniform, without undergoing any
modifications. The memory of the mind, can be lost, because -
being an evolute of prakrti (matter), it is changeable.

It means that, when a man identifies the self with the world ~
and the body, it is called 'vismrti' (forgetfulness). But, when by _
separating himself from the world and the body, he realizes the
self, it is smrti (memory or knowledge). The memory of the self,
is One's Own memory, without the help of any other means, such .
as senses and mind etc., while the memory of the mind, is an
inclination of the mind. As a man, has knowledge of his entity
without any proof, without the help of any organs through his -
own self, similarly, self-realization, is through one's own self.

It is beyond all organs and instruments etc. .
The memory of the self, is gained instantly, without any
effort. Karna, was the son of Kunti,.but when he was abandoned
by Kunti after his birth, he was brought up by Radha, the wife
to a charioteer named Adhiratha. So he took Radha to be his
mother. But when he came to know from the sun-god, that his
mother was Kunti, he gained memory, without any effort.

The self, being a fragment of God, is desireless, pure and
liberated. But a man having forgetfulness (disinclination), of the
self, has desires, becomes impure and is bound. But, when he
has no affinity, at all with mind etc., his memory (knowledge),
is automatically aroused, without making any effort and without
any practice. When once it is aroused, it is not lost, so is not
to be aroused, again.

Memory (knowledge), is aroused by God's grace. His grace ee
"
2122,"2072 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter18 .. -
is showered upon, a man, when he has an inclination for Him.
He has an inclination for Him, when he has a disinclination
for the world. As Arjuna said to Lord Krsna, that he would act ,
according to His word, similarly, a devotee without depending
on the world, should declare that he will act according to His |
word, only. | | .
__ It means that this memory (knowledge), is gained by the :
Lord's grace, when a striver has an inclination for Him. So
Arjuna says that he has gained knowledge (memory), through
His grace. The Lord continuously showers His limitless grace -
upon all beings, but a man realizes His grace, when he has an -
inclination for Him. |
By the expression 'Tvatprasadanmayacyuta’ Arjuna wants to ;

say to Lord Krsna, that He by His grace has disclosed to him ~
the most secret essence. So it is only by His grace, that he has
gained knowledge (memory). First, he requested Him to instruct
him who had sought refuge in Him, but then he said that he -
would not fight. Till he got Self-realization, the Lord goaded
him. It was only His divine grace. Even unasked, He disclosed -
the supreme secret, the topic of surrender to him (18/64—66).
Thus, by His grace, he could know the reality, and his delusion
was dispelled. , ,

'Sthito'smi gatasandehah karisye vacanam tava'—Arjuna says
to Lord Krsna, that his doubt whether he should wage the war
or not (2/6) is dispelled totally, and he is now established in
reality. It means, that he has no desire of his own, he will act,
according to His word.

Here a point needs attention. First, Arjuna had delusion because
of his attachment, to his kith and kin. There, the Lord declared
the process, ""When a man thinks of the sense-objects, attachment
for them arises; from attachment springs up desire; from desire
ensues anger; from anger arises delusion; from delusion loss of |
memory; from loss of memory, the destruction of discrimination;
"
2123,"Verse 73] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI . 2073 ~
from destruction of discrimination, he perishes (Gita 2/62-63).
Arjuna by reminding the Lord of that process, declares that his
delusion is dispelled, and he has gained memory, which was |
destroyed by delusion. In response to the statement, that from
loss of memory, there is destruction of discrimination, Arjuna
says, that his doubt is dispelled. In response to the statement,
that from destruction of discrimination, one perishes, Arjuna 7
declares that he stands firm. By saying so, Arjuna wants to.
explain to Lord Krsna, that he has listened to the gospel of the
Gita and so he remembers it. But as far as the destruction of .
his delusion is concerned, it is only because of His grace. Thus -
the description of delusion, as described there and here, is one :
and the same. | :
In the second chapter from the sixty-first to the sixty-third -
verses, the Lord declared that wisdom of a person, whose
senses are under control, is steady. It means, that when a person
having a disinclination for the world, depends only on God, his :
intelligence is firmly set. If he does not depend only on Him, his
mind thinks of sense-objects and then the process of attachment, ""
desire, anger, delusion etc., follows. These ruin a man, because
they are demoniac propensities. But here, is the description of
his progress. When he, having a disinclination for the world, -
has an inclination for God, his delusion is dispelled, because
he possesses a divine nature. It means, that a person goes to
ruin, if he, having a disinclination for the Lord, is overpowered
by his senses, is described there. But here, when a man has an
inclination for God, it is by His grace that he gains memory
(knowledge), of his real affinity with God.
In the spiritual sphere, God's grace is a more effective means,
than hearing of texts, cognition, constant musing, meditation and
trance etc. The reason is, that when a striver follows any spiritual
discipline, by depending on his own effort, he maintains subtle |
egoism, which perishes, only when the striver totally depends on ee
"
2124,"2074 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 :

the Lord's grace, without regarding it as fruit of his effort.
Arjuna said that he had gained memory. The question arises |

why had he lost it. When a man (soul), by identifying himself |

with the unreal attaches importance to it, he forgets, the self. By

forgetting the self, he thinks that the shortage of the unreal, is

shortage in him. Similarly, by identifying himself with the body, :

he regards the death and birth of a body, as his own death and

birth, and he regarded his father, rather than the Lord, as his -

creator. So he became forgetful of the Lord. -

If a question is raised here as to whether the mistake was |

made prior or affinity with the non-self, was assumed, earlier. -

In other words, whether through ignorance, he assumed affinity -

with the non-self first, or through affinity with the non-self, there

was ignorance. The answer is, that the Lord bestows the human

body, so that man (soul) may be free from a cycle of birth and -

death, which he has been following since time immemorial and

may attain infinite bliss, viz., God-realization. God felt bored all -

alone (Brhadaranyaka 1/4/3). The Lord created the human being,

in order to play with him. The game can be played smoothly

and freely, when both the players are free. So the Lord gave him

freedom, as well as discrimination, so that he could distinguish

the real from the unreal. If the Lord, had not bestowed upon

him, freedom and discrimination, he might have been like a .

beast, without any speciality. But man, misused this freedom

and got attached to unreal pleasure and prosperity. This was his

error of judgment. Now the question arises, why is he attached

to the unreal? The reason is, that he wants to enjoy transitory

pleasure without thinking of their result (Strivers are those who

think of the result, while the worldly people are those who do

not think of the result). Attachment to the unreal, is the cause

of error. How to know it ?
"
2125,"Verse 73] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 2075 -

When a man, having renounced his attachment to the unreal,
has an inclination for God, his error is rectified and his memory,
is gained. This proves, that attachment to the unreal, is the real
cause of error. This error is not natural, it is man-made. As he
has created it, so it is his responsibility, to rectify it. The Lord,
has given him power, to rectify this mistake. As soon as, this
mistake is rectified, the memory (knowledge); of the self, is
automatically regained and then nothing remains to be done, to 7
be known and to be achieved by him.

Till now, man has taken birth many times, and he has -
had his union and again disunion with things, persons, states, -
circumstances and incidents etc., many times, but he himself has
remained, the same. Union is surely to be turned into disunion, -
while disunion is not definitely to be changed into union. In _
fact, there is only disunion, there is no union This process of
disunion, has been going on since time immemorial. What seems
union, is continuously turning into disunion. The realization of -
total disunion, from the world is Yoga—'This disconnection from
union, with pain is called Yoga’ (Gita 6/23) (Yoga—union with -
the self or with God). This union, is self-evident and eternal.*

But this union is not realized, because we assume our union

with the world and the body. As soon as, this assumed union -
is renounced, the real union is realized. Assumption of union

with the world, is forgetfulness (ignorance) and realization of

the fact, that a man can never have union with the world, is

memory (knowledge). : |

Appendix—The worldly memory is a relative term, which 1s
contrary to forgetfulness; but the memory of the divine entity is
not of that kind but it is—a state of realization. The independent
of this “Tattva’ experience has been called here ‘smrtirlabdha’.

In fact there is never forgetfulness of that divine entity but

*In the Disciplines of Action and Knowledge there is eternal union with |
the self while in the Discipline of Devotion there is eternal union with God.
"
2126,"2076 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 18 -

there is only turning away from it. It means that first there was >

knowledge and then it was forgotten—this sort of forgetfulness

is not applicable to the divinity.* If we accept it as this sort

of forgetfulness, then after memory again it will sink into

oblivion. Therefore it has been declared in the Gita—‘yajjnatva |

na punarmoham’ (4/35)—viz., having gained this knowledge of

the Self, a man does not get deluded again. Having assumed

the non-Existent (unreal) as existent and according significance -

to it, a striver has disinclination for the real—this is known as

forgetfulness. These—disinclination and inclination are from the -

view-point of a striver rather than from the view-point of the :

Self. The real Self ever remains the same, whether we have

inclination to it or disinclination for it. If we assume the non- :

Existent (unreal) as non-Existent, the existent entity (the real

Self) will naturally reveal itself the same as it is. , 7
The thought is of two kinds—one is that we think of something

and the second type of thought wells up. The former thought -

is an action but latter is not an action. In the former there is

predominance of intellect but in the latter there is breach of 7

affinity with the intellect. Therefore the Self is not realized by

former type of thought but it 1s realized by the revelation of the

thought. It means that when a striver, having the aim of Self- -

realization, goes on differentiating the real and the unreal using his

discrimination, and the unreal is renounced, then “the world neither

existed, nor exists, nor will exist nor can exist’—this thought

is revealed. With the revelation of this thought, discrimination

gets transformed into Self-realization viz., the world disappears |
* Having gained knowledge (Self-realization) there appears nothing new

viz., it does not appear that first there was ignorance and then the knowledge was |

gained. Having gained knowledge a striver realizes that he was ever endowed

with knowledge, only he had not an eye on it. If it is assumed that first there

was ignorance, then the knowledge was gained, it means that knowledge has

a beginning while it is beginningless. Anything, that has a beginning, ends

and that, which is beginningless, is erdless. .
"
2127,"Verse 73] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 2077 7
and the divinity is revealed; the assumed existence comes to an :
end and the reality remains. The revelation of thought has been
mentioned here as ‘smrtirlabdha’.
‘Apara Prakrti’ (the lower nature) belongs to God. But we |
have committed an error that we have been connected with the
lower nature viz., we have assumed it as ours and for us. We
are responsible for this connection, so it is our responsibility to
renounce it also. Because of the assumption of our. affinity with ;
the lower nature, we have forgotten our real affinity with God
and we are bound. Therefore only renunciation of affinity with ~
the lower nature will lead us to salvation. In order to renounce -
affinity with the lower nature—‘“the body is neither mine, nor it
is for me’—importance should be attached to this discrimination. -
By attaching significance to this discrimmation—‘the lower nature -
is neither mine nor for me”—the memory is gained.
Arjuna has not realized the dualistic or non-dualistic entity but
he has realized the real entity which transcends both dualism and -
non-dualism. The reason 1s that dualism-non-dualism is delusion*
while Arjuna’s delusion has been destroyed. .
A man (the Self) naturally belongs to God from time
immemorial, he has to renounce only the dependence on the
world. Arjuna has predominantly gained the memory of Bhaktiyoga, -
Karmayoga and Jianayoga are the means but Bhaktiyoga is an
end. Therefore the memory of Bhaktiyoga is real. The memory
of Bhaktiyoga is—‘vasudevah sarvam’ viz., “All is God”. The
realization of ‘vasudevah sarvam’ is ‘smrtirlabdha’. This realization
is possible only by God’s grace—‘tvatprasadat’. Words (utterances)
are limited but the Lord’s grace is limitless. -
Reflection involves the sense of doership but in memory there
is no sense of doership. The reason is that reflection (thinking) is
done with the mind; the intellect is superior to the mind, ego is
*“dvaitadvaita mahamohah’ (MaheSsvara tantra) : .
‘aho maya mahamohau dvaitadvaita vikalpana’ (Avadhita 1/61)
"
2128,"2078 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
superior to the intellect, the Self is superior to ego, the memory
is gained by the Self. We reflect upon something but in memory
only the eye is cast there. At the time of forgetfulness also
the divinity remains the same. In divinity there is no oblivion,
therefore as soon as a glance is cast, the memory is dawned.
‘Sthito’smi gatasandehah’—At first from the view-point of a
Ksatriya, Arjuna thought that it was justified to fight in the war;
then having seen his teachers and elders arrayed on the battle-
field, he thought that sin would accrue to him by slaying them;
but as soon as the memory was gained, all the problems were -
solved. His doubt whether he should wage the war or not, was °
totally dispelled. Then Arjuna said to Lord Krsna that nothing
remained to be done by him but he would carry out His order -
only—‘karisye vacanarh tava’. This is surrender. .

Link:—In the twentieth verse of the first chapter, the gospel ;

Comment:— |
""Ityaham vasudevasya parthasya ca mahatmanah'—S anjaya

says, that he heard the dialogue between Krsna and Arjuna,

which is wonderful, singular and thrilling. -
Here the term ‘Iti’ (thus), denotes the conclusion of the

dialogue, which was started by the term ‘Atha’ (Now) in the

twentieth verse of the first chapter. -
Arjuna, is addressed as high souled, because Lord Krsna,

carries out his direction. When he orders Lord Krsna to place ~

his chariot between the two armies, He places it there (1/21,1/24). :

Moreover He answers all the questions, put by Arjuna in detail, :

in a loving manner. Thus Safyjaya heard the dialogue between :

the high souled Arjuna and Lord Krsna.
'‘Sarnvadamimamasrausamadbhutam romaharsanam'— What is -

wonderful and thrilling in the dialogue? It is generally mentioned

in the scriptures, that a man can follow a spiritual path and attain _

salvation, by renouncing the world. People in common, have the

same belief that a person, having renounced the world, and by ;

becoming a recluse, can attain salvation. But, according to the

gospel of the Gita, a man can attain salvation by making proper

use of the circumstances, he is placed in. The circumstances may ;

either be the sweetest, and the most favourable or the bitterest

and the most unfavourable, like massacre in war, they can lead

to salvation.* The reason is, that attachment to the world, is the

cause of one's birth in good and evil wombs (Gita 13/21). Proper

use Of circumstances, is the means to root out, that attachment
* A man can attain salvation under all circumstances through non- .

attachment. In fact it is non-attachment to the world which leads to salvation.

This non-attachment can be developed by any means as that of the Discipline

of Action or Knowledge or Devotion. But it is the attachment which is the

stumbling block to salvation. When attachment is renounced, aversion also

disappears. When a man becomes free from attachment and aversion, he attains

salvation, because liberation from them is called salvation. ;
In fact a man is emancipated but he has assumed (accepted) that. he.is |

bound. As soon as he abandons this assumption, he becomes free. ee
"
2130,"2080 $RIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
i.c., he who performs his duty, being free from attachment and |
aversion, is easily set free, from bondage (Gita 5/3). This is
something wonderful in this dialogue. | |
The Lord, having incarnated, disclosed his identity and asked ,
Arjuna to take refuge in Him. This disclosure of His supreme
- secret, causes Safijaya’s hair to stand on end and thrills him
with bliss. . = -
Appendix—In the Gita the term 'mahatma’' (the exalted Soul)
has been used only for devotees. Here Safijaya has addressed -
Arjuna as ‘mahatma’ because he regards Arjuna. as a devotee. |
The Lord has also declared 'bhakto'si me’ viz., 'O Arjuna! thou -
art My devotee’. | | -

_ By the grace of Vyasa, I come to hear this supreme and ,

Comment:—
'Vyasaprasadat Srutavan'—Saiijaya was very much delighted,
after hearing the dialogue between Lord Krsna and great souled
Arjuna. This supreme secret, was heard by him, by Vyasa's grace.
The Lord Himself addressing Arjuna, declares that He will speak
to him His supreme word from a desire to do him good (10/1);
He asks him, to listen again to His supreme word, the most secret
of all, as he is very dear to him (18/64); He truly promises that
"
2131,"Verse 76] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 2081 °
he will come to Him, for he is dear to Him (18/65); He asks
him not to grieve, as He will release him from all sins (18/66).
Safijaya could get this golden opportunity of listening to the
Lord's secret gospel, only by Vyasa's grace. , | |
'Etadguhyam pararn yogam'—This gospel of the Gita, is the
supreme and the most secret Yoga, because it has been imparted by
the great Lord of all Yogas. The eternal affinity of the embodied
soul, with the Lord is Yoga. In order to realize that union, a
striver, has to practise the Disciplines of Action and Knowledge _
etc. This set of Yogas (Disciplines), described in the Gita, has
been called the scripture of the Yoga (yogasastra). -
""Yogesvaratkrsnatsaksatkathayatah svayam'—Sajiijaya's joy :
knew no bound. Therefore overwhelmed with delight Safijaya
declares that he has heard this Yoga (Gospel), direct from Lord -
Krsna, Himself declaring it. What was the need to Safijaya to
use the five words 'YogeSsvarat, Krsnat, Saksat, Kathayatah and
Svayam’ here? Sanjaya by using these five words, wants to say
that he has not heard this dialogue, by way of tradition or through
any other person, but he has heard it direct from the holy lips :
of the Lord Himself.
Appendix-—-Arjuna said to the Lord ‘tvatprasadat’ viz., ‘by
Your grace’ (18/73), while Sanjaya feeling obliged to Vedavyasa
here says, “vyasaprasad” viz., ‘by the grace of Vyasa’. The Lord
by His grace bestowed upon Arjuna the divine eye while Vyasaji
by his grace bestowed upon Sanjaya the divine eye.

Comment:— : a

""Rajansamsmrtya samsmrtya samvadamimamadbhutam
keSavarjunayoh punyam hrsyami ca muhurmuhuh—Saijaya
says to Dhrtarastra, that the dialogue between Lord Krsna and

| Arjuna, is so wonderful and thrilling, that it can lead a man to -
salvation, even when engaged in the horrible activity of killing
people, in a war. Remembering this dialogue Sajfijaya, rejoices
again and again, by thinking that a man can attain salvation, .
under all circumstances. -

This dialogue is a, unique one. Though Lord Krsna and

| Arjuna, lived together for a long time, yet there was never such a ;
wonderful and thrilling conversation, between them. When Arjuna -
was puzzled with regard to his duty, on the one hand, he did
not want to fight, due to his attachment to the family and on -
the other hand, as a member of the warrior class, it was his first
and foremost duty to fight. When a person does not adhere to
_ a belief, he becomes confused finding himself restless.* Arjuna -
was in a dilemma.

It was his restlessness, which enabled him to be attracted .
towards the Lord. It was because of his inclination, exclusive
devotion and curiosity, that the Lord having forgotten His
supremacy, was so much engrossed in love for Arjuna, that
He disclosed the most profound and the supremely secret,
gospel of the Gita to him. No one, can describe the merit of
this dialogue.

Appendix—The dialogue between Lord Krsna and Arjuna
is full of so much profound and secret truth which has neither

been mentioned in a treatise nor has been narrated by any
exalted soul in his spiritual discourse. This is a very singular
dialogue between the Lord and His devotee. Such clear facts are —
available neither for study nor for listening. In this dialogue it — :
is mentioned that even such a horrible activity as war can lead ~
a man to Salvation. This dialogue explains that a man of every .
Varna (order of life), ASrama (stage of life) and Sect etc., under -
every circumstance, can attain salvation. Therefore this dialogue is
very marvellous—‘sarhvadamimamadbhutam’. When this dialogue _
is so unique, then how much unique it will be, if the gospel of
this dialogue is translated into practice! :
The gospel preached by Lord Krsna is very wonderful*, and _
the Lord preached the gospel of the Gita by getting established
in YogaT, so how wondrous and singular this gospel should be! -
The political speech delivered by Lord Krsna in the Kauravas
assembly was so singular that hermits and sages went there to .
listen to His speech¥; then this Gita is the spiritual dialogue. In
Srimadbhagavata also when Uddhavaji perceived that the Lord
* vacam tam vacanarhasya siksaksarasamanvitam
aSrausamahamistartham pascaddhrdayaharinim
(Mahabharata, Udyoga. 59/17)
Sanjaya said—‘After that I listened to the gospel of Lord Krsna Who is
well-versed in conversation, whose each and every word was educative. That
gospel presented the derived import and attracted the mind.’
{ dharmarthasahitaé vacah rotumicchama. miadhava

ParaSuramaji said :—O Madhava, scorcher of the enemies! We want to

answered the questions in a very singular manner, then he put
thirty-five questions altogether (Srimadbha. eleventh canto,
nineteenth chapter, twenty-eighth to thirty-second verses).
‘Hrsyami ca muhurmuhuh’—Safjaya could never get a :
chance to listen to such facts pertaining to actions, knowledge
and devotion any other where, therefore Sanjaya was thrilled
with joy again and again after listening to this dialogue. .
Sanjaya knew the Lord in reality. When Dhrtarastra asked
Safijaya about it, Safyaya answered— _
mayam ca seve bhadram te na vrtha dharma miacare,
Suddha bhavam gato bhaktya sastrad vedmi janardanam. :
(Mahabharata, Udyoga. 69/5) -
O King! may you live happily! I am never fraudulent.
I don’t indulge in hypocrisy. My heart has been purified by 7
God’s devotion; therefore I know Lord Krsna in reality as He
is mentioned in the scripture.
Thus first Safjaya knew Lord Krsna in reality, by studying
the scripture; but afterwards he knew Him in reality, having ;
directly heard the dialogue between Him and Arjuna.

preceding verse, Safijaya declared the dialogue between Lord

2135,") Verse 77] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 2085 -
a Krsna and Arjuna to be wonderful, while here he declares His
5 cosmic form, to be the most wonderful. Why? The reason is,
i that the dialogue can be studied even now but His cosmic form
cannot be beheld now.
In the ninth verse of the eleventh chapter Sanjaya called
Lord Krsna the great Lord of Yoga, while here he declares that
remembering again and again that most wonderful form of Hari .
(Krsna), great is his astonishment. It is natural to be astonished,
beholding the cosmic form of the Lord of Yoga. Further Lord -
Krsna, revealed to Arjuna His cosmic form out of compassion, ;
while Sanjaya was able to behold that cosmic form, by great -
sage Vyasa's grace. .
Though the Lord revealed, His cosmic form to mother -
Kausalya, when he incarnated as Rama, to mother Yasoda and -
also to Duryodhana etc., in the assembly of the Kauravas. When
He incarnated as Lord Krsna, yet those cosmic form were not so
terrifying and wonderful as that was seen by Sajijaya, because in 7
_ the latter form, principal warriors were rushing head-long into the
Lord's fearful mouth, set with terrible tusks and some were seen -
stuck between His teeth with their heads crushed. In the latter
form, it was seen that both the armies were being slaughtered.
Remembering such a wonderful form of Lord Krsna, Sanjaya
was thrilled with joy, again and again and he declared, that it
was only by great sage Vy4asa's grace, that he could behold His
cosmic form.
Appendix—The Lord revealed to Arjuna His Cosmic Form
which was within limits. Had Arjuna not been confused with
fear, the Lord would have revealed His Cosmic Form in more
details. But Safijaya was wonder-struck after beholding even
that Cosmic Form.
Sanjaya first knew the glory of the Lord, having studied the
scripture; then he listened to the wondrous dialogue between Lord -
Krsna and Arjuna; and then he beheld the most wonderful Cosmic
"
2136,"2086 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
Form of Lord Krsna. It means that the dialogue between the
Lord and Arjuna was more wondrous than what he had studied
in the scripture; and more wonderful than the dialogue, was His
Cosmic Form. Therefore Sanjaya has mentioned the dialogue as |
wonderful—‘sarhnvadamimamadbhutam’ (18/76) and the Cosmic |
Form as very much wonderful—‘rapamatyad bhutam’.

Comment:—
""Yatra yogeSvarah krsno yatra partho dhanurdharah'— Sanjaya -
says to Dhrtarastra, addressing him as the king, that where there
is Lord Krsna the protector, the adviser of Arjuna, the Lord
of all Yogas, possessing great power, prosperity, learning and
wisdom; and where there is Lord Krsna's obedient and loving
friend, Arjuna, the archer, there are prosperity, victory, glory
and righteousness—such is his conviction.
When Lord Krsna bestowed upon Arjuna, divine vision,
Sanjaya addressed Him as 'Mahayogesvarah' (the great Lord of
Yoga). Now reminding Dhrtarastra, of the same great Lord of Yoga,
he uses the term 'Yogeévarah' (the Lord of Yoga). The Lord is
the inspirer, who inspires archer Arjuna, who is obedient to Him.
"
2137,"Verse 78] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 2087 :

The Lord has been called the Lord or the great Lord of
Yoga, because He is the master of all Yogis. He possesses, all
virtues such as omniscience, prosperity, beauty and gracefulness,
naturally in a bondless quantity. These virtues, are eternal and
axomatic. All virtues culminate in Him. , |

When the war was declared, Bhisma was the first to blow
his conch to declare the war, on behalf of Kaurava-army. It was
proper on his part to do so, because he was the chief commander.

But on behalf of Pandava-army, it was Lord Krsna, the chariot-

driver Who declared the war, by blowing the conch. From the - |
worldly point-of view, the Lord was only a charioteer. So what -

right had He to declare the war, by blowing a conch? But he did

it and nobody resented it. It means that He was the chief of the -
Pandava-army, while Arjuna stood next to Him. So here Sanjaya _
mentions their names, in order to show their importance.

Throughout the gospel of the Gita, the Lord addressed
Arjuna as ‘Partha’ thiry-eight times, more than any other name. -
Similarly Arjuna has addressed the Lord as Krsna nine times,
more than any other form of address. Thus the term ‘Partha,’ -
is more loving to Lord Krsna, while the term ‘Krsna’ is more
loving to Arjuna. Therefore, while concluding the Gita Sanjaya,
also uses these two terms. -

‘Tatra Srirvijayo bhitirdhruva nitirmatirmama'—Wealth,
splendour and prosperity, are included in the term ‘Sri’. Where
there is Lord Krsna, the husband to the goddess of wealth, there
wealth is naturally in abundance.

The term ‘Vijaya, denotes Arjuna, as well as bravery |
and valour etc. Where there is valorous Arjuna, there such
characteristics, as heroism and vigour etc., naturally prevail, as
these are the characteristics of members of the warrior class. .

Similarly, where there is Lord Krsna, the Lord of Yoga,
there are glory, nobility, influence, competence and such other
virtues; and where, there is righteous Arjuna, there are morality,
"
2138,"2088 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 18 -
righteousness and firm policy etc. The fact is, that all virtues,.such :
- aS prosperity, victory, glory and righteousness etc., are always ,
present in Lord Krsna, as well as, in Arjuna. This division has
been done according to predominance of the virtues, of the two. |
Otherwise, all divine traits, such as prosperity, gracefulness,
modesty, generosity and beauty etc., are naturally found, in
boundless quantity, in both of them.
Safijaya answers the question of Dhrtarastra, which he asked
indirectly, by declaring that the victory of Pandu's sons, is certain
without any doubt. | .

2140,"APPENDIX ONE :
Bird's-Eye View on the Gita

The eighteenth chapter of the Gita, is the gist of the whole :
Gita, and all the topics discussed in the previous seventeen
chapters have been summed up here. In this chapter, there -
are three important points which need attention—(1) A topic, -
which has been touched upon in brief in other chapters, has
been discussed in detail, in this chapter, (2) a topic, which has _
been examined in detail in other chapters, has been concluded
here, briefly and (3) topics dealt with in other chapters, have -
been elucidated in a different manner in this chapter.

In the gospel of the Gita there is particular reference to two -
disciplines about which the Lord has mentioned thus, ""This has
been presented to you from the view-point of Jnanayoga; now :
hear the same from the stand point of Karmayoga"" (2/39) also.
""Two courses of spiritual discipline were enunciated clearly by
Me to the world, in the past—the discipline of knowledge to the -
discerning and the discipline of action to, the people of action""
(3/3). Arjuna, at the beginning of the eighteenth chapter, puts
a question to the Lord, to understand the reality about the two
disciplines. So reference to disciplines has been concluded, in the
eighteenth chapter, either in brief, or in detail or in a different
manner, as necessary. -

The subject of devotion, which has been dealt with specially
from the seventh to the twelfth chapters is a secret of the Lord's
heart, is totally different from the other two disciplines and is
unique. In the discipline of devotion, a devotee depends only |
on God and is dedicated only to Him. The Lord concludes the |
gospel, commending persons to depend on Him or surrender to
"
2141,"APPENDIX ONE 2091 -

Him, or taking refuge in Him. :

From the thirty-ninth verse of the second chapter upto the
end of the second chapter, and also in the third chapter, there is _
predominant description of the discipline of action. In the sixty-
first verse of the second chapter, the term 'Matparah' has been
used for ""dependence on God"", which has been described in a
little more detail in the thirtieth verse of the third chapter. Thus
there is also some description of devotion, with the discipline -
of action. In the fourth chapter, the Lord while mentioning how
the discipline of action was handed down from generations, _
describes the divine character of His birth and activities and
then the discipline of action, while explaining that His actions :
are models for others. In the fifth chapter, there is a comparative -
discussion on the two disciplines and finally the Lord briefly
defines devotion and concludes the chapter. Thus the discipline ~
of action discussed from the second chapter to the end of the
fifth chapter, has been explained in a different way from the ;
fourth to the twelfth verses, of the eighteenth chapter.

The discipline of knowledge, dominated by discrimination,
is examined from the thirteenth to the twenty-sixth verses of the .
fifth chapter, and from the nineteenth to the thirty-fourth verse
of the thirteenth chapter, has been interpreted in a differently
manner from the thirteenth to the eighteenth verses of the |
eighteenth chapter.
_ The allotted (obligatory) duty mentioned in the eighth verse of
the third chapter, has been expounded in detail, from the forty-
second to the forty-eighth verses, of the eighteenth chapter.

The discipline of devotion detailed from the seventh to
the twelfth chapter has been. touched upon briefly and in a
different manner, from the fifty-sixth to the sixty-sixth verse,
of the eighteenth chapter.

The description of the four social orders, which is given |
in brief, in the thirteenth verse of the fourth chapter has been
"
2142,"2092 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA -
amplified from the forty-first to the forty-fourth verse of the
eighteenth chapter. Here (in 18/41—44) it can also be assumed
as the conclusion of the innate faith, mentioned in the first and
the second verse of the seventeenth chapter.
While describing the discipline of knowledge, the Lord declares -
that all actions are performed by nature and its modes (guna)
(3/27, 13/29). He also states that the seer perceives no agent, other
than the modes (14/19), He in addition explained that the senses ~
move among the sense-objects (5/9) etc. The same topic has been
developed further, from the thirteenth to the eighteenth verses of ~
the eighteenth chapter in brief, and in a different way. :

Methods of Recitation of the Gita -

It is a man's nature that when he performs an act with great
interest, he is dedicated to it and absorbed in it; yet he cannot -
identify himself with prakrti (Nature) and its evolutes, (objects :
and pleasures etc.,) because he is always different from them. -
But, if he remains absorbed in chanting the Lord's name, in |
thinking of Him and in meditating on His principles (teachings), -
he is identified with Him, because then he is one with Him. -
Therefore, when a devotee recites His name, thinks of Him and
studies the sacred books, such as the Gita, the Ramayana and
the Bhagavata etc., he would be absorbed in them. The method -
of the recitation of the Gita is given hereunder:

In order to recite the Gita, there should be a seat of KuSsa -
grass, or of a woollen cloth or of sack cloth and then a person
facing the east or the north, should sit on it.

At the beginning of the recitation of the Gita, the following ;
sacred text (verses) should be recited—

""Om asya Ssrimadbhagavadgita mala mantrasya bhagavan
vedavyasa rsih, anustup chandah, sri krsnah paramatma devata’,
asocyananvasocastvam prajnavadamsca bhasase iti bijam,
sarvadharman parityajya mamekam Saranarh vraja iti Saktih, |
aharh tva sarvapapebhyo moksayisyami ma Sucah iti kilakam.""

The explanation of this text is as follows:—

As there are many beads in a rosary or flowers in a garland,
so are the verses recited by the Lord, like the beads of the rosary
of the Gita. The first seer to understand the significance of these |
verses, was divine Vedavyasa—'Om asya Srimadbhagavadgita
"
2146,"2096 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA .
mala mantrasya bhagavan Vedavyasa rsih'. :
There is much use of the metre ‘anustup' (a verse of thirty-two
letters in Sarnskrta), in the Gita. The Gita begins with this metre,
(Dharmaksetre.....) and the gospel also begins with and, (ASocyan
anvasocastvarh.....) ends with the metre (Yatra yogeévarah...), the
same metre. The gospel also begins (ASocyananvagocastvarn) and
ends with it (sarvadharmanparityajya). The metre used ts 'anustup’. -
Lord Krsna, who is the Supreme Goal, to be attained by all
human beings is its God (Lord). -
The gospel is preached to the ignorant, and they deserve ”
the same gospel, Arjuna is also talking about righteousness but
he is grieved because of attachment (infatuation) to his family. -
So his mind is confused, with regard to his duty. Therefore, he
takes refuge in the Lord and prays to Him to instruct him what -
is decidedly good for him. So, in order to remove his grief, the
Lord starts preaching the gospel of the Gita, which is the seed -
of the Gifa—'aSocyananvasocastvam......bijam’.
Self-surrender to God (refuge in God), is the quintessence
of all spiritual disciplines and all gospels, because no other :
discipline is as easy, excellent or powerful, as taking refuge in
Him. So it is best for a-‘man to take refuge in Him, by renouncing
dependence on all other spiritual disciplines—'sarvadharman-
parityajya.....Saktih’. | oo
The Lord promises that He will liberate the being, who
takes refuge in him, from all sins. The Lord could never
deviate from this promise, .as it is a ‘Kilaka’ (a pivot)—aharm
tva sarvapapebhyo...kilakam. |
Thus after reciting the text ‘Or asya Srimadbhagavadgita
mala mantrasya......iti kflakam’, the activity of 'Nyasa’ (touch of
hands and fingers together; and of heart, known respectively
as 'Karanyasa’ and 'Hrdayadinyasa') should be performed. The
significance of this activity of ‘Nyasa’ is explained as follows:— |
In the scriptures it is mentioned that a devotee should worship
"
2147,"_. APPENDIX TWO. 2097 -
gods and study the sacred books to becoming divine viz., by being |
pure and holy. That divinity, purity or holiness is embraced by
vesting the holy texts, in the body and its parts (any). The holy
text or the hymn, which is to be recited, should be absorbed |
by the devotee in the body. This is known as 'Nyasa' (Nyasa of
hands and his fingers and Nyasa of the heart).

Karanyasa, means the touch of the ten fingers together or |
the touch of both the palms together or the touch of the outer ~
surfaces of the hands together, m reciting the sacred text— -

- (2)'Nainamh_ chindanti Sastrani nainarn dahati pavaka
ityangusthabhyam namah'—By reciting this sacred text, the -
thumbs should be in touch, together. _

(2) 'Na cainam kledayantyapo na Sosayati maruta iti tarjanibhyam
namah'—-By reciting this sacred text, the forefingers of the two
hands should be in touch, together. 7

(3) 'Acchedyo'yamadahyo'yamakledyo'fosya eva ca _iti
madhyamabhyam namah'—By uttering this sacred text, the -
middle fingers should be touched together.

(4) 'Nityah sarvagatah sthanuracalo'yam sanatana
ityanamikaébhyam namah'—By reciting this sacred text, the :
ring-fingers should be touching together.

(5)'PaSya me partha rip4ni SataSo'tha sahasraSa iti kanisthi-
kabhyarm namah'—By uttering this sacred text, the little fingers
should be touched together. :

(6)'Nanavidhani divyani nanavarnakrtini ca iti karatala-
karaprsthabhyarh namah'—-By reciting this sacred text, the palms
and the outer surfaces of the two hands should be in touch.

Hrdayadinyasa means touch of the heart etc., with the five |
fingers of the right hand, on reciting the sacred text—
"
2148,"2098 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA -

(1) ‘Nainarh chindanti éastrani nainarh dahati pavaka iti hrdayaya |
namah'—on uttering this sacred text, the heart should be touched
with five fingers of the right hand. ,

(2)'Na cainam kledayantyapo na Sosayati maruta iti Sirase
swaha'—on uttering this sacred text, the forehead should be
touched, with the five fingers of the right hand.

(3) 'Acchedyo' yamadahyo'yamakledyo'sosya eva ca iti Sikhayai
vasat'—on reciting this sacred text the tuft of hair on the top of ;
the head should be touched with the five fingers of the right hand.

(4) 'Nityah sarvagatah sthanuracalo'yam sanatana iti kavacaya -
hum'—on reciting this sacred text, the left shoulder should be -
touched with the five fingers of the right hand while the right -
shoulder with the five fingers of the left hand. -

(5)'Pasya me partha ripani SataSo'tha sahasraSa iti netratrayaya ~
vausat'—on reciting this sacred text, both the eyes and the middle
part of the forehead (where the third eye of wisdom is supposed -
to be) should be touched with the front part of the five fingers
of the right hand. |

(6) 'Nanavidhani divyani nanavarnakrtini ca iti astraya phat'—on
reciting this sacred text the night hand should first be taken to
the back of the head from the left hand side, and then should -
be brought to the front side of the head, from the right hand
side and should clasp the left palm with the forefingers and the
middle finger of the right hand. :

After 'Karanyasa' and Hrdayadinyasa’, one should utter the
text—'Srikrsnaprityarthe pathe viniyogah’ viz., 'I want to recite
the Gita only to please God.’

There are three methods of the recitation of the Gita,
‘Srstikrama’ (from the beginning to the end), ‘sarnharakrama’'

(from the last verse of the eighteenth chapter to the first verse
of the first chapter) and 'sthitikrama’ (from the first verse of the .
sixth chapter, to the last verse of the eighteenth chapter and then 7
"
2149,"APPENDIX TWO | 2099
from the last verse of the fifth chapter to the first verse of the
first chapter). A celibate may recite the Gita, through Srstikrama,
a renouncer, through sarhharakrama, and a householder, through
sthitikrama. But it is not a hard and fast rule. The recitation of |
Gita, in whatever way done, is always beneficial.

The Gita recited with 'Samputa’ (recitation of a verse at the
beginning of each verse), with 'Samputa valli, (recitation of a
verse two times at the beginning of each verse) and without
‘Samputa'’. Any verse can be selected as ‘Samputa’. In recitation _
with 'Samputa’ the verse of 'Samputa' is first recited and then °
the verse of the chapter. Again, the verse of the 'Samputa’, 1s ”
first recited, then the verse of the chapter is recited. Again the :
verse of the 'Samputa' is recited and then the second verse of :
the chapter. This process should continue. This is done either -
from the beginning to the end of the Gita or from the end to
the beginning (from the first verse of the first chapter to the
last verse of the eighteenth chapter or vice versa). In 'Samputa -
Valli recitation of the verse selected as 'Samputa' is recited two
times. If the Gita is recited with ‘Samputa' or with ‘Samputa ""
Valli’, uncommon power is gained. If the gospel of the Gita is
specially reflected upon, the heart is purified, peace is attained
and the devotee becomes qualified for God-realization. ,

The Gita is also recited without the recitation of the verse
of 'Samputa’. A striver can recite all the eighteen chapter either
everyday; or nine chapters the first day and the remaining nine
chapters the next day; or six chapters each day for three days;
or three chapters each day for six days; or two chapters each
day for nine days. If he wants to recite the whole Gita in
fifteen days, one should recite one chapter each day, from the
first date to the eleventh date, on the twelfth date he should
recite the twelfth and the thirteenth chapters, on the thirteenth
date he should recite the fourteenth and fifteenth chapters, on |
the fourteenth date, the sixteenth and the seventeenth chapters
"
2150,"2100 §RIMADBHAGAVADGITA :

and on the fifteenth date, the eighteenth chapter. If there is an

increase or decrease of date, in the fortnight according to the

Hindu calendar, the sixteenth and the seventeenth chapters, can |

be recited for two days or the seventh and the eighth chapters,

both, can be recited, in one day only. |
If a striver has learnt the whole Gita by heart, he should

recite the first verse of all the eighteen chapters, then the second ;

verse of all the eighteen chapters and then the third verse of

all the chapters and so on. Thus he should recite the whole

Gita. Similarly he can recite the last verse of all the chapters .

beginning from the last chapter to the first and then the last -

one verses of all the chapters from the last chapter, to the first.

Thus he should recite the whole Gita from the last chapter, to ”

the first chapter. | _
