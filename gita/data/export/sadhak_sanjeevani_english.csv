12,"| Srimad Bhagavadgita holds an incomparable and unique
position in world literature. It recalls the divine voice of Lord
Krsna, through which many of His mysteries and inner secrets
are revealed. In communicating these for the benefit of mankind,
the Lord has invoked Arjuna, as an interlocutor or questioner.
The small book, full of the Lord’s extraordinary thoughts and
views from the very heart, was never excelled in the past, nor
would ever be, in the future. .
Our revered Param Shraddheya Shri Swami
Ramsukhdasji has delved deep into the bottomless depths
| of this profound scripture and extracted invaluable gems,
which in his magnanimity, he has through his commentary
in Hindi, called 'Sadhaka Safijivani offered for the. benefit
and spiritual advancement of aspirants. It is obvious that
. this commentary. is singularly different and ‘distinctive, in
many respects, from other publications. Though we claim
no far-reaching study of other critiques and annotations,
yet we are struck by new interpretations, new meanings
and new revelations in this commentary, arising from many
verses, such as; Chapter one—Verses: ten, nineteen, twenty
‘and twenty-five; Chapter two—Verses: thirty-nine and forty;
Chapter three—Verses: three, ten, twelve, thirteen and forty-
three; Chapter four—eighteen and thirty-eight; Chapter five—
Verses: thirteen and fourteen; Chapter six—Verses: twenty
and thirty-eight; Chapter seven—Verses: five and nineteen:
. Chapter eight —Verse: six; Chapter nine—Verses: three and
thirty-one: Chapter ten—Verse: forty-one; Chapter eleven—
Verses: twenty-six, twenty-seven, forty-five and forty-six;
Chapter twelve—Verse: twelve; Chapter thirteen—Verses:
one, nineteen, twenty and twenty-one; Chapter fourteen—
Verses: three, twelve, seventeen and twenty-two; Chapter

13,"IV . SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA

fifteen—Verses: seven and eleven; Chapter sixteen—Verses: five
and twenty; Chapter seventeen—Verses: seven and ten; Chapter
eighteen—Verses: thirty-seven and seventy-three, etc.

We are confident that with an in-depth study of the
commentary, aspirants would discover many different facets
and resolutions, from these and other verses, for their better
understanding and help in forging ahead with their Sadhana.

In the present times, unfortunately, there is a dearth of books,
which would in simple language and with lucidity, explain and
delineate the correct path and milestones of an aspirant's progress,
and this void often results in their predicament. Therefore, the
publication of a detailed commentary, in plain words and simple
style with clarity and offering elucidation and explanation, such
as this work, is at once a most welcome and important step. -

Swamiji Maharaj's commentary is apparently, neither intended
to promote a new or particular philosophical viewpoint, nor in
the least, a means to display learning; but that it should and
would act as a life-giving boon, like the Safijivant herb, for all
aspirants, no matter which creed, faith, religion, or language
or place, they belong to. The Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, Muslim,
Christian and others etc; in studying this book, would discover

| in it, a basis for their advancement, in accordance with and

| supportive of the tenets of their individual faiths or religions and
they would find enough material in this book, to help achieve
their spiritual goals. |

To gain spiritual bliss, we humbly urge aspirants to study
the commentary deeply and sincerely, understand the writing
and endeavour to put into practise the contents, for their own
forward progress in the world.

"
14,"Srimad Bhagavadgita-Sadhaka Saiijivani—with commentary
by Param Shraddheya Shri Ramsukhdasji Maharaj in its English
version has, on all hands, been an outstanding and much
appreciated exposition of the divine and immortal work. It has
been reprinted before and is now ready for another printing.
Time was, therefore, opportune for a revision of this masterly
analytical and exhaustive commentary, so that, if necessary, clarify
and amplify comments in order to enhance its understanding and
gainful usefulness. |

The result may be called a revision or a mere new work.
It is a revision, in as much it retains the basic concept, approach
and arguments of the first edition. What is new, however, is
the elucidation and precise explanation of some comments
in English, in order to eliminate any possible ambiguity or loss
of clarity. It is in this light that changes made must be read.
The amendments are unpretentious, and are intended to make
reading easy.

The book is, at the same time, somewhat new, in as much
as, an opportunity has been taken, importantly, to include—with
the approval of the author, Param Shraddheya Shn Ramsukhdasji
Maharaj—two additional and valuable appendices at the end of
the commentary on the Gita. The first Appendix entitled, ""A
bird's eyeview of the Gita"", is a summarised essence of the
scripture, highlighting its core and offering a capsulised version
for quick comprehension and ready reference. The second
Appendix, covers the traditional and other suggested ""Methods
of Recitation of the Gita"", to help devotees to seek and achieve
spiritual benefit of worship, through the Gita. Both these
sections were authored by Param Shraddheya Shri Ramsukhdasji

Maharaj and originally mcluded in his monumental and celebrated
book, ""The Gita Darpana—The Gita A Mirror"", and published
by the Gita Press.

The Publishers are confident that the changes effected, would
make this revised edition of the Bhagavadgita-Sadhaka Saijivani
of greater interest to the English readers and would be acclaimed
by them. This edition makes it still more comprehensive, more
meaningful and beneficial, for aspirants of spiritual elevation, as
to students of the Gita, as well as to the perspicacious members
of different creeds and faiths, idealogies and religions interested

: in this unique and secular publication—-The words of God.

May, the publishers urge the readers to study this revised
edition of the Gita, with deep profundity and put into creative

The word 'Yoga' of the Gita is pregnant with many wondrous
meaning. We can place these under three heads: |

(i) Derived from the root ""Yujir Yoge’ (af a1) the word
‘yoga’ has the implied meaning—eternal kinship with equanimous
(aqeq) God; as in 'Samatvath yoga ucyate' (2.48) etc. This
meaning has importance in thé Gita. |

(ii) Originating from the root ""Yuj Samadhau', the word ‘yoga’,
implies—stability of citta i.e., a state of trance during meditation;

| as in 'Yatroparamate cittarh niruddharh yogasevaya’ (6.20) etc.

(iii) Deduced from the root ""Yuj Sarhyamane’, the word ‘yoga’
means—controling power, divine prowess, magnetic impact; as
in 'Pasya me yogamaiswaram' (9.5) etc.

Wherever the word 'Yoga’ has appeared 1n the Gita, it has
in it the primacy of one of the aforesaid three meanings, the
other two meanings having a secondary place only. As in the
word ‘yoga’ derived from ‘yujir yoge’, there 1s the predominance
of the meaning of equanimity, though on realization of
equanimity, meditational stability and divine prowess* also accrue
automatically. In the word ‘yoga’ from ""Yuj samadhau', there is
the supermacy of transcendental stability, but on achievement of
this state, equanimity and prowess follow, automatically. In the
word ‘yoga’ from ""Yuj Sarhyamane’, there is the dominance of
divine prowess and majesty, but on realization of this prowess,
equanimity and stability also, follow suit on their own. Thus the
word ‘yoga’ of the Gita has very pervasive and profound meanings.
universe which belongs only to God—that power the Yogi does ‘not acquire—Jagadvyap
aravarjam (Brahmasiitra 4.4.17). The power which a Yogi gains, enables him to conquer
nature (Gitd 5.19), meaning that no amount of favourable or unfavourable circumstances,
can in anyway affect him.
"
19,"XIV SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA

In the YogadarSana of Sage Patanjah, the word ‘yoga’ is the
name given to the control of cittavrttis (mental tendencies and
mind-stuff) from taking various forms—'Y ogascittavrttinirodhah’'
(1.2) and the effect of that yoga has been pointed out, as the
lodgement of drasta (the witness) in one’s own self: ""Tada
Drastuh svarupe'vasthanam’ (1.3). In this way, the very result
of Yoga as depicted in the Yoga-DarSsana of Patafijali has been
given the name ‘yoga’ in the Gita (2.48; 6.23). The implication
is, that the self-proved natural state of equanimity totally cut
off from the cittavrttis, is called 'yoga’ by the Gita. On realizing
lodgement in equanimity, (eternal unison—Nityayoga), there is
never a disunion or deviation from it. There is a desireless
transcendental state, (nirvikalpa avasthd) when there is control
over mental tendencies. But on realization of equanimity there
is 'desireless transcendental awareness 'nirvikalpavastha.' This
‘desireless transcendental awareness— nirvikalpa bodha—is the
illuminator of statelessness, as well as, of other states.

For a seeker to have experience of equanimity or eternal
unison, three yoga-ways have been expounded in the Gitéa—the
Path of Action, the Path of Knowledge and the Path of Devotion.
There is an inalienable relationship of the three bodies—the
gross, the subtle and the causal,—with the world. To, employ
these three, in the service of others—is the Path of Action. The
realization of one's identity and lodgement within one's own
self, after dissociating from these, it is the Path of Knowledge;
and surrendering one's self to God—is the Path of Devotion.
In order to accomplish these yogas, and attain one's salvation,
man is endowed, with three powers (i) power to act (strength),
(11) power to know (knowledge), and (ill) power to believe
(faith). The power to act is for rendering service to the world
selflessly—that is Karmayoga; the power to know, is meant for
Self realisation—that is Jnanayoga; and the power to believe, is
"
20,"Unfathomable and illimitable is the glory of Smad Bhagavad

Gita. This holy book, the Bhagavad Gita, is counted among the —
scriptural trio, the 'Prasthana Traya’. The three royal ways of
welfare of mankind, are known by the name of Prasthana Traya:
one is the ""Vedic Prasthana’ called the Upanisad; the second is
| metaphysical or Philosophical Prasthana’ called the Brahma Sitra;
and the third is, 'Smarta Prasthana', called the Bhagavad Gita.
_ There are ‘Mantras’ (mystical rubrics), in the Upanisads., 'siitras’
(aphorisms) in the Brahma Sitra and ‘slokas' (verses), in the
Bhagavad Gita. Though the Bhagavad Gita has only Slokas', yet
these being the very voice of God, are verily mantras. Pregnant,
as the Slokas are with meaning and import of great profundity,
| these can be called ‘sutras’ also. The Upanisads are of use and
value for the deserving only, and the Brahma Siitras, are of
use and importance for men of erudition and learning, but the

Bhagavad Gita is for, one and all. |

The Bhagavad Gita is a most unusual and many facetted
scripture. It contains highly useful and detailed material for a
seeker, be he of any country, costume, community, disposition,
creed, ‘varna’ or any ‘asrama’' (station), in life. It is so, because
_ there is in it, neither denunciation nor praise of any creed or
denomination, in particular; instead it deals with the essence of
pure Reality only. Pure Reality (the Supreme Lord or Paramatma),
as that which is wholly beyond change in Nature and the nature-.
born things and is ever-eternally immutable and uniform, in the
midst of the flux in space, time, things, being, circumstance etc.
Real 'Tattva’, (essence), is ever-present in its perfect form, in
each man, wherever and however, he is. But that is not realized
"
21,"X SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA
because of attachment and aversion—raga and dvesa—born of
the changeable nature of things in a person. Only on achieving
complete freedom from attachment and aversion, it is automatically
realized and with ease. |
The teachings of Bhagavad Gita are singularly divine.
: Numerous commentaries have been written on it and several more
are being written, yet new and fresh ideas continue to surge,
| in the hearts and minds of saints, seers and sages, of wisdom.
However much thought may be given to this. profound Song
Celestial, the meaning and deeper implications thereof, none can
fathom in their entirety. The deeper they delve into it, the more
profound the meanings are to be found, therein. When the range
of the finer emotions of a learned person is not easily judged
how can then the magnitude of emotions encased in the words of
God, whose forms and names are infinite, be ever assumed?
There is such a uniqueness in this small-sized work, that
a real seeker of one's salvation (Kalyana) irrespective of varna,
asrama, nationality, creed, belief etc., is at once attracted by
the mere study of this treatise. If a man reads and grasps, even
a little, from this sacred book, several satisfying disciplines or
ways, become available to him for his life's fulfilment. Different _
authorities exist for the study of respective systems of philosophy,
but the unique significance of the Gita, is that all the seekers of
salvation are eligible for its study. | |
In explaining different disciplines (sadhana), and in
communicating the meanings in detail, no hesitaion was felt in
repeating matters about each discipline in the Bhagavad Gita,
and yet its size has not increased unduly. No single holy book
of wisdom exists, which expounds the full import of Reality with
| such. precision and prolification. A man with intense yearning for
- his ‘kalyana’ (goal) can realize Godhead, the Supreme Truth, in

to totally surrender to God, after regarding God as one’s own
and one's own self, as God's—this is Bhaktiyoga. He, in whom
interest to act dominates, is qualified to adopt the Path of Action.
He, in whom inquisitiveness for Self-realisation dominates, is
eligible and qualified, for the Path of Knowledge. He, in whom
faith and belief in God dominates, is qualified for the Path of
Devotion. All these three Yoga-paths. are independent means
of God-realization. All other means are also implicit in these
three paths.* | a : :

The main object of all the paths, is to accomplish separation
from non-self. However, there does remain a difference in
these disciplines in attaining separation, but after completing
this breach with matter (non-self), all means lead to realization
of one equanimous; supreme Godhead. This very realization of
‘Paramatmatattva’, the Gita has called ""Yoga’; and verily, this is
called, 'Nityayoga'—the Eternal Union. —

It is not right, that there has been given only a description,
in the Gita of Karmayoga, Jiianayoga, or of Bhaktiyoga. Besides

_ . these three yogas, there is a description of yajfia (sacrifice), dana
(charity), tapa (penance), dhyanayoga (yoga of meditation),
_ pranayama (control of breath), hathayoga (austere discipline of

| body etc.), layayoga (yoga of rhythmic unison) etc. The reason

""Y ogastrayo maya prokta nrnar Sreyovidhitsaya; jiianam karma cabhaktisca:

seekers eager for their welfare: those of knowledge, action ard devotion. There
is nowhere, any other way of total well-being.""

for it is, that Arjuna's questions in the Gita are not about war,
but really about salvation. Lord Krsna's purpose in discoursing |
this Gita was not the conduct of war. Arjuna definitely wanted
his salvation (2.7; 3.2; 5.1). Therefore, as many means of his |
welfare, which have been reflected in the scriptures, have been
| with precision, detailed in the Gita. Keeping in view all. those
means, the Gita is specially held in high esteem; the reason being,
that a seeker might belong to any belief, creed, or doctrine, but _
one's salvation is indeed, dear and open to all. |
In a ‘Jiva' (being)—there is an 'amSa' (element) of the
Conscious God and an ‘arhSa' of the inert nature (prakrti). By
the dominance of the Conscious-part, one seeks God; and by the
dominance of the inert part, he desires the world. Between these
two, the yearning for God could be satisfied, but the desires of
the world are never fulfilled. Some worldly desires seemingly
fulfilled are never satiated, but owing to worldly attachment, ever
_ new desires arise. In fact, the satisfaction of worldly desires or
| achievement of worldly objects, is not within the authority of
desire, but is subject to karma. God-realization is not under the
power of karma, and it is attained by the intense longing of one's
own Self. Its reason is, that each karma (act), has a beginning and
an end; so the result too is bound to have a beginning and an
end. How can then a beginningless and endless God, be realized
by karmas, which are origin and end bound? But seekers have
often understood, that as the worldly objects are achieved by
the predominance of activities, so also the realization of God
would be achievable through the dominance of activity. As the
assistance of body, senses, mind and intellect, has to be taken
in achieving the objects of the world, so also in God-realization,
the assistance of body, senses, mind, intellect will have to be
"
24,", SADHAKA-SANJIVANI XVII
called for, they argue. Therefore, such seekers practise spiritual
discipline, erroneously with the help of their inert body etc., to
realize God. | |

By practising the Yoga of Meditation for a long time, i.e.,
gradually fixing one's mind on God, when the 'citta' (mind) gets
controlled, having no worldly attachment and being incapable
of realising God, due to inertness, it becomes unconcerned
with the world. On the citta (mind) becoming unconcerned, the
seeker becomes completely cut off from the mind or inertness,
and he gains experience of Godhead automatically (Gita 6.20).
But a seeker, who having accepted his axiomatic and eternal
unison with God, from the beginning without accepting in the

~ Jeast, his kinship with inert matter, traverses the course of his
discipline, he experiences the Supreme Tattva (essence) early,
and with ease. | : |

Thus, for seekers who wish to realize God, there are two
disciplines or ways of seeking Him. The discipline, in which
there remains dominance of ‘antahkarana’ (the inner faculty)
i.e., wherein a seeker observes discipline with the assistance of
matter which goes by the name of 'karana sapeksa salt’. (Discipline
aided by the Inner faculty). The second discipline, in which
the seeker, from the very beginning, follows the discipline by
himself, without the assistance of matter, is called, 'Karana
Nirapeksa Saili' (Discipline unaided by the Inner faculty). God-
realization, in both these disciplines, takes place only by Karana
Nirapeksata 1.e., by one’s own self (after a complete breach with
matter). Realization via 'Karana Sapeksa Saili' comes very late,
whereas it happens immediately, through 'Karana Nirapeksa Sailf.
There are four main differences, between these two disciplines
of seeking God.

(i) Assistance of matter, (body-senses-mind-intellect) has to
"
25,"XV SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA

be taken in the 'Karana Sapeksa Sailr’, but no such assistance is
necessary, in the ‘Karana Nirapeksa Saili’, instead the assumed
relationship with matter, is to be sundered or broken up. _

(ii) There is, creation of a new state of mind in the 'Karana
Sapeksa Saili’, but there is realization after breach with all states
of mind in the 'Karana Nirapeksa Sailt’. |

(iii) There is, in the discipline aided by the instrument, (‘Karana
Sapeksa Saili’) an acquisition of occult powers (siddhis), but

. in the discipline unaided by the instrument, (Karana Nirapeksa
- Saili,) there is a direct and intuitive experience of Reality, on
severance of relationship with matter.* — |

(iv) God-realization, in the ‘discipline aided by the inner .

faculty’ is never immediate, but in the ‘discipline unaided by the
| Instrument’ God-realization (siddhi) is immediate, as soon as a
breach with matter is complete, either after surrendering to God,
| or on being established in the self. |
- In the Yogadarsana of Patafijali, importance is given to -
‘discipline aided by the antahkarana' in the realization of yoga,
but in the Gita, importance is attached only to ‘discipline unaided
by the faculty’, in the realization of yoga (armfafg). It is alright
if the mind gets tuned to God, but if it is not so tuned, then
_ _*Ifit were possible to have direct God-realization with the ‘Discipline aided
by Instrument’ (Cittavrttinirodha), then the ""Vibhuti-Pada' (wherein ‘Siddhis’ are
described) of Patafijali's YogadarSana, would have been futile. Those 'siddhis' or
powers, which are acquired by the ‘Discipline Aided By Instrument’, are hurdles
in the path of God-realization. Even in the Patafijali YogadarSana, the ‘siddhis’
are regarded as obstacles—'Te samadhavupasarga vyutthane siddhayah’ (3.37)
i.e., these (siddhis) are obstacles in the attainment of Samadhi and are ‘powers’ _
during 'Vyutthana' (behavioural) world; ‘Sthanyupanimantrane sahgasmayakaranam
punaranistaprasangat (3.51) i.e.,on being called by the gods guarding the directions,
(by offering temptations of the enjoyments of their realms), neither should one
have attachment for them, nor should one take pride in them; because in doing so,
there is again a possibility of the loss of realization (anista) or a fall.
"
26,"SADHAKA-SANJIVANI XIX
nothing happens—this is the basis of the ‘discipline, aided by
the inner faculty’. Whether or not, mind is attuned to God, it
does not matter; but one's self should be attached to God—this
reflects the ‘discipline unaided by the inner faculty’. The import
and implication of all this is, that, in the 'Karana Nirapeksa Sailr’,
there is direct relation of the self with God, with a total breach
of ties, with the mind intellect complex. Therefore, realization
in the 'Karana Sapeksa Saili' is affirmed by practice, but there
is no need for any other steps, in the 'Karana Nirapeksa Sail’.
The reason is that, there is ‘axiomatic eternal union’ (nitya
yoga) with God. Thus, there is no necessity of any practice in
believing or knowing, one's unitive relation with God; just as
on accomplishment of marriage, when a woman accepts a man
as her husband, she needs to do nothing further, in so believing.
So also, on being told by someone that. ‘here is Gangaji' no
further exercise is to be done, even to realise it.* In the 'Karana
Nirapeksa Saili', The primacy is only of knowing (viveka) and
believing (bhava). If one says, 'T have no relation with inertness
(body etc.) at all'—even without such an experience, if a seeker
firmly believes in this from the very outset, then also such a
realization, clearly dawns upon him. As he was in bondage under
the mistaken belief that, 'I am the body and the body is mine’,
so too, by cultivating the right belief that, 'l’ am not the body
and the body is not mine’, a seeker becomes liberated; because,

* In fact, no worldly illustration is completely befitting, pertaining to the
matter of knowing or believing in God. The reason, is that in believing or
knowing, the world, there is the association of mind and intellect, but in believing
and knowing there is no association of mind and intellect at all, meaning
thereby that God's experience is the realization by one's own self, not by mind-
intellect. Secondly, the act of believing and knowing the world has a beginning
and an end, but there is no such beginning and end, in believing and knowing
God. Reason being that there is nc relation of our being with the world atall, whereas
our relation with God is, since the very beginning, and will always be so.
"
27,"XX SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA —
as a principle, by not relying on, the accepted belief it tends to
| melt away. God, has clearly told us in the Gita, that an ignorant
person, accepting his link with the body, regards himself, as the
doer of things that happen— 'Ahankaravimudhatma kartahamiti
manyate’ (3.27). But an enlightened person, does not regard
himself as the doer, of. those activities—'Naiva: kificit karomiti
yukto manyeta tattvavit' (5.8). It means therefore, that to root
out a false belief, it is necessary to stress a true belief.

‘IT am a Hindi’, 'I am a Brahmana’, ‘I am a Sadhu’, etc., such
beliefs, become so firm that until man does not give these up by
himself, no one else, can make him change his belief. Similarly,
the belief that, 'I, am the body’, ‘I, am the doer’ etc., also becomes
so firm, that it is difficult for a seeker to give these up. But,
these worldly beliefs being unreal and untrue, are not everlasting
and are instead, changeable. As against these beliefs, such as,
‘I am not the body’, 'I am God's’ etc., being real and true are
never lost, but there is only a degree of forgetfulness, a turning
of back on these. Therefore, a real belief on becoming firmly
rooted, does not remain as mere belief, but is transmuted into
a realized awareness (experience).

Though, ‘Discipline aided by inner faculty has been described
in the Gita (as in, 4.24—30; 6.10—28; 8.8—16; 15.11 etc.) yet
‘Discipline unaided by inner faculty’ alone, has been described
with great emphasis (as in, 2.48,55; 3.17; 4.38; 5.12 (first half);
6.5; 9.30-31; 12.12; 18.62, 66,73 etc.). The reason is, firstly that
God desires that seekers should realize Him, early and easily. In
the second place, Arjuna has sought from Him, the means of his
own salvation, on being confronted with a situation of war. Thus,
the “Discipline unaided by the faculty’ alone, could be of use,
for his salvation; because by this discipline of 'Karana Nirapeksa
Sail’, man can achieve his salvation, under all circumstances
"
28,"SADHAKA-SANJIVANI XXI
even while carrying out his activities, according to scriptural
injunctions of karma. Only, through this discipline (without any
practice) Arjuna's delusion was ended and memory of his real
self revived (18.73). :

The ‘Discipline unaided by the inner faculty’, is useful for all,
in equal measure; because there is no necessity, for any special —
ability, condition etc. In this discipline, by developing an intense
desire for God-realization, and immediate separation from matter
being accomplished, the eternal God, is realized. Just as many
year's darkness might be, eliminated by merely kindling a candle,
so also, a very old relationship with matter (of countless births)

there might be, is cut off by a strong and keen yearning, for —
God-realization. Therefore, this intense yearning is a much higher
State, than even ‘Samadhi'—a state of meditative poise—born of
Karana Sapeksata. There is even, a deviation from the highest —
state of ‘nirvikalpa samadhi—into routine behaviour, as with a
beginning and an end, of ‘Samadhi’ also. So long as there is,
a beginning and an end, there exists an affinity for matter. On
renunciating the tie with matter, then seeking spiritual discipline
with the beginning and no end instead, there arises the realization
of an eternal union with God.*

In reality, there was never a disunion (viyoga) with God,
and this is not, even possible. Separation from God appears only
by an assumed relationship with the world (sarnyoga). A man —
intensely eager for God-realization, realises God immediately, after
renouncing the assumed link with the world and merges with Him. _

* Till there exists a tie with inertness, two states do obtain; because
changeable as it is, the inert Nature never remains uniform. Thus these two
States of entry into and exit from equipoise—'Samadhi' and ‘Vyutthana—
arise out of their tie with inertness. On severance of a tie with inertness,
what remains is ‘Sahajavastha’, eternal stateless state, which is called ‘Sahaja
Samadhr by the saints. There is then no relapse or return from it. :
"
29,"XXII SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA
_ Even the need to purify the inner faculty arises, only inthe

‘Karana Sapeksa Saili’, and not in the 'Karana Nirapeksa Sailr.
As, when a pen is good, writing can be excellent but that does
not improve the writer, so also on the inner faculty being pure,
activities could be pure but not the mind of the doer. The doer
becomes pure, on a breach of the tie with the inner faculty;
because the very belief in one's kinship with this, is the root

of impurity.

Axiomatic is '‘Jiva's (the being's), eternal union (yoga) with
the ever-available (nitya prapta) God; thus there is no need for
any instrument for His realization. Only the sight needs to be
turned towards that side, as is observed in Soi Ramacaritamanasa,
‘Sankara Sahaja Saraipu Sarnhara' (1.58.4) meaning, Lord Sankara
contemplated on the nature of His own self, turned his looks
into Himself. A thing looked at, is perceived by us, only by
turning the gaze to it and it becomes known, to be there. In the
same way, by simply discerning it, Nitya Yoga, is experienced.
But, on account of desire, expectation and enjoyment of worldly
pleasures, a great difficulty is felt in turning our sight or attention
towards it, and in realizing it. Till the mind remains tied to
the acquisition and enjoyment of worldly objects, there is no
Capacity in man to turn his gaze towards his real Self. If, by
any reason, chance or perception the gaze happens to be directed
toward the self, it would be extremely difficult to hold it there
permanently. The reason is, that intense endearment (priyata),
for destructible materials, which resides in the heart, does not
permit the understanding of one's eternal and obvious relationship
with God; and even if it is well comprehended, it does not allow
its stability. If intense longing prevails the Reality (tattva) is
realized, then this longing has the power to destroy the very

- attachment, for the world. |
"
30,"SADHAKA-SANJIVANI XXIT

_ All the three yogas—Karmayoga, Jnanayoga and Bhaktlyoga—
spoken of in the Gita are realizable through the discipline of
‘Sadhana 'Karana Nirapeksa’ 1.e., through one’s own self. As the
activity and material, are neither ours nor for ourselves, instead
these belong to others and are meant for the service of others.
The belief or thought thus discriminately arrived at, that 'I am not
the body, nor is the body mine, I am God's and God is mine’, is
not born of the ‘discipline aided by antahkarana and body etc.,
(practice), because it involves a breach of the tie with matter.
Thus, in Karmayoga the seeker himself, gives up his relationship
with inertness, in Jianayoga the seeker realizes his own self; and
in Bhaktiyoga, the seeker surrenders himself to God.

In this 'Sadhaka Sanjivanit commentary on the Gita too,

_ primary importance is given to the ‘discipline unaided by inner
faculty’; because this commentary has been written, keeping in view
the way a seeker's salvation 1s attained, easily and without delay.

-

Since my early age, I had a special interest in the Gita.
Meditative introspection on the Gita and association with and
utterances of saints and great souls, have been of immense help
to me in understanding the real import, of the Gita. The Gita,
brims with ideas, infinite and astounding, which provide great
satisfaction. The ability to understand these ideas fully, and
express these with perfection, is not within my power. But when
certain Gita-loving gentle persons pressed me hard and especially —
urged me, then I felt like preparing a commentary on the Gita,
with the object, that its hidden heart-touching ideas—marmika
bhava—may be revealed to me, so that others also, may in turn |
introspect and meditate upon these, and these ideas may become |
intelligible, to them too. :
"
31,"XXIV SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA
First, a commentary on the twelfth chapter was written which
was published in Vikrama Samvat 2030, under the name of, ‘Gita
Ka Bhaktiyoga’. A few years latter, a commentary on the thirteenth
and fourteenth chapters was dictated, which was published in
Vikrama Sarhvat 2035 as, ‘Gita Ka Jianayoga’. A thought
arose thereafter, that since there are three ""Yogas'—Karmayoga,
Jiianayoga and Bhaktiyoga—it would be more appropriate if three
books were prepared on the three yogas. With this in view, a
commentary on the twelfth chapter, was recast, enlarged and
combined with the commentary of the fifteenth chapter, which
was published in Vikrama Sarnvat 2039, as ‘Gita Ka Bhaktiyoga’,
| (second edition). Then, a commentary on the third, fourth and
fifth chapters, was dictated, which was published in two volumes,
under the title, 'Gita Ka Karmayoga’'. Its delayed publication
came in Vikrama Sarhvat 2040. .

_A different kind of format (Saili), was followed in the
afore-mentioned three books—'Gita Ka Bhaktiyoga’, 'Gita Ka
Jnanayoga’, and ‘Gita Ka Karmayoga’'; the order adopted in
them was, first the context (sambandha), then the verse (Sloka),
then the emotional import (bhava), next the analysis of the
verse (anvaya); and last, the 'pada’-wise commentary. After the
publication of these three volumes, the format was again changed
in the following order; first, the context, then the verse and last,
the commentary. In making the change, the inspiration came from
others also. The idea behind this change was, that the reading
material should be reduced a little, and set out early, so that
the readers would not have to spend more time in reading, and
that the book was prepared speedily, to reach the readers, early.
With this frame-work, the commentary on the sixteenth and the
seventeenth chapters, was. got ready first. This was published
in Vikrama Samvat 2039, under the name of 'Gita Ki Sampatti
Aura Sraddha'. A commentary on the eighteenth chapter, was
"
32,"SADHAKA-SANJIVANI XXV
prepared thereafter, which was also published in 2039, under —
the title: ‘Gita Ka Sara.’ | : |

After the commentary: on the sixteenth, seventeenth and

eighteenth chapters was completed, someone suggested that it —

would be better, if the meaning of the 'Slokas' was also provided;

for if the reader first grasped the meaning of the 'sloka’, it would

be easier for him to follow the commentary. Thus in the second
edition of 'Giti Ki Sampatti Aura Sraddha' (Vikrama Sarnvat 2040)

the meaning of ‘slokas' was also added. With the addition of the
meaning of the verses, a change in the order of the commentary
on the ‘padas’, was also introduced.

Later, a commentary on the tenth and eleventh chapters was
prepared and published, under the name of, 'Gita Ki Vibhiti
Aura Visvaripa-Darsgana’. Then followed a commentary on the
seventh, eighth and ninth chapters, which was published as 'Gita

Ki Raja-vidya’. Thereafter, came a commentary on the sixth
chapter, which was published as, ‘Gita Ka Dhyanayoga’. Last
was dictated a commentary, on the first and second chapters,
which was published as, ‘Gita Ka Arambha’. All these four books,
were published in Vikrama Sarnvat 2041.

It was thus that by the grace of God, a commentary on

_ the whole of the Gita was published by the Gita Press, in ten
separate volumes. In its publication, several difficulties, of paper
etc., continued to arise, but with the effort of 'Satsangi' brothers, —
the work of publishing these went on satisfactorily. The public
also accepted these books with enthusiasm and pleasure, with the
result that several books, underwent two or three editions. :

The present commentary has not been dictated sitting at one
place, and the order of dictation has also not been systematic, _
from the first chapter to the eighteenth. Therefore, many variations
may appear from the pre and post (piirvapara) view, between the:
"
33,"XXVI SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA
first and the last chapter. But seekers. will feel no difficulty in it,
anywhere. At some places a difference in interpretation might also
appear, but in that of Karmayoga, Jnanayoga and Bhaktiyoga—all
the three are independently instrumental in God-realization, and _
there is no real difference. The primary feeling (bhava), while
dictating the commentary has been, as to ‘how early the seekers
could be benefitted’. For this reason, there has been a change
in its language, diction etc., in this commentary. :
In this, the interpretation of many Slokas, is contrary to other
commentaries. But the intention is not, in the least, to show that
other commentaries are wrong; instead, I have interpreted the
verses as seemed. non-controversial, apt; corresponding to the
: context, rational, viable, satisfying and dear to me. There has never
been my intention of anyone's refutation or confirmation. ..—
The meaning of Srimad Bhagavadgita, is very profound. By its
reading, its teaching, introspection, meditation, and contemplation,
unique, strange and ever new ideas and emotions continue to
arise, whereby the mind and intellect, being thrilled; become
contented. While dictating this commentary, whenever the mood —
to capture these emotions arose, a strange flood of thought used
to overwhelm me, as to how and which of the ideas should I
relate—and I used to find myself at bay, in this regard. Yet
with the help of my associates, and respectworthy friends and
at their behest and persuasion, I could dictate something. They
used to write down those ideas and, after a revision, these were
briefly published in the form of books. Thereafter, whenever there
arose occasions to scan through these books, several discrepancies
| seemed to have crept into them, and it appeared that all the ideas
had not been included and many had been left out. So revisions
and enlargements continued to be made in these, from time to
time. Therefore, our readers are requested, to accept and give
"
34,"SADHAKA-SANJIVANI XXVII
appropriate importance only to contents written later, instead of _
comments, made earlier.

The commentary, on the whole Gita, being in several separate
volumes, a difficulty was felt in their revision and publication and |
in obtaining all of these volumes together. Keeping this in view,
the commentary on the whole Gita has been published now, in one
single volume, in the form of the present book. Before doing this,
the whole commentary published earlier, has again been looked
into and necessary revisions, alterations and enlargements have
also been introduced. The commentary on the thirteenth and the
fourteenth chapters, has been revised. Care has also been taken
to maintain the uniformity of language and diction. Many things
which were deemed unnecessary, have been omitted, many new
matters have been inserted, and many others, have been shifted
from one place to an appropriate place elsewhere. Matters which
had been variously repeated, have also been omitted, as far as
possible, though not completely. Repetition deserving special
attention and considered useful for seekers, has not been omitted.
Several shortcomings are still possible in this work, for which
I seek the reader's pardon, with folded hands. Readers are also
requested to kindly intimate any mistakes they may come across.
This will facilitate rectification, in future editions. :

A compendium of research articles, of new and novel themes,
pertaining to the Gita has been prepared separately and published
under the title, ‘Gita Darpana’.

First Chapter
INTRODUCTION |

After the expiry of twelve years of exile and residing in an
unknown place for one year, the Pandavas demanded half of their
kingdom from Duryodhana, as was his promise but he refused to
give even as much land as could be covered by the point of a
needle, without waging war. The Pandavas sought permission from
their mother Kunti, and accepted.the challenge of a war. After this
decision, both the Kauravas and the Pandavas, began preparation for it.
Sage Veda Vyasa had great affection for Dhrtarastra, the blind
king of Hastinapura. Due to his affection, he said to Dhrtarastra,
“War and massacre of the Ksatriyas 1s inevitable. If you want to
see the scene of the battlefield, I can endow you with divine sight
so as to enable you to see scene of war, from the place you are
sitting.” Dhrtarastra said, “I have been blind all my life. Now I
don’t want to see the slaughter of my own kith and kin. But I
want to hear the details of the war.” Then sage Vyasa said,” I
endow Sanjaya with this divine sight by which he will know,
hear and see, not only the incidents of the battlefield but also
the ideas, in the minds of the warriors and will narrate these to
you.” Saying so, sage Vyasa endowed Safijaya with divine vision.
The battle started on the battlefield of Kuruksetra at the appointed
hour. Safijaya stayed in the battlefield, for ten days. When Bhisma
being badly wounded with arrows, fell off the chariot, Safijaya
conveyed the message to Dhrtarastra who at that time was in
Hastinapura. Hearing this news, Dhrtarastra was filled with great
sorrow and started to cry. Then he asked Sanjaya to narrate to him
all the details of the war. Upto the twenty-fourth chapter of the
Bhisma-Parva (section), Safjaya narrated the incidents of the war.* At
the beginning of the twenty-fifth chapter, Dhrtarastra asks Safiijaya—
* In the Mahabharata there are eighteen sections. In those sections there
are several sub-sections. In the Bhisma section there is this Bhagavadgita, a sub-
section which begins with the thirteenth chapter of the Bhisma section and ends

with the forty-second chapter.

Dhrtarastra said: .

O SajijayaT, assembled at the holy-field of Kuruksetra, eager
to fight, what did my sons and the sons of Pandu, do? 1

| Comment:—

‘Dharmaksetre kuruksetre’-—In Kuruksetra the gods
performed holy sacrifice. King Kuru also performed penance
there. Thus being saturated with a spiritual atmosphere, the
field of Kuruksetra has been called the field of righteousness
(Dharmaksetra).

Here by the word ‘Ksetra’ in “‘Dharmaksetra’ and “Kuruksetra’
Dhrtarastra means to say that this is the land of the Kurus. This
is not merely a battlefield, but a land of pilgrimage, in which
human beings by performing holy actions, can attain benediction
in this life. Therefore, by consulting noble persons, this land has
been chosen, for both mundane and ultra mundane benefits.

In this world generally, there are three root causes of
disputes viz., land, wealth and woman. Out of these three, the
kings primarily fight for land. Hence, there is the significance
of the name ‘Kuruksetra’ here. In the Kuru-family the sons of
Dhrtarastra, as well as, those of Pandu, are included. Therefore,
both of them have an equal claim over the land of Kuru. But

* Within the dialogue between VaiSampayana and Janamejaya there is the
dialogue between Dhrtarastra and Safijaya; and within the dialogue between
Dhrtarastra and Sajfijaya there is the dialogue between Si Krsna and Arjuna.

‘ss F Safijaya was born of Gavalgana. He possessed knowledge and
righteousness like sages. He was Dhrtarastra’s minister (Mahabharata Adi. 63/97).
"
46,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 3
the Kauravas refuse to give the Pandavas their share of land, so
war between them becomes inevitable.

Though the word “Kuruksetra’ is fair and justified, because
the land belongs to both the cousin groups, yet Indian culture,
is so unique that righteousness is given top priority in it.
Therefore, even an action such as war, is performed on the field
of righteousness—a land of pilgrimage, so that the warriors may
attain salvation. Therefore, the word ‘Dharmaksetra’, has been
used along with ‘Kuruksetra’ here.

There is one more point, which needs attention. In the first
verse of the first chapter of the Gita, the first word is ‘Dharma’,
and in the last verse of the eighteenth chapter the last word is
‘Mama’. Therefore, if ‘Dhar’ is taken from the first word and ‘Ma’
from the last word, the word becomes ‘Dharma’ (righteousness).
Therefore, the whole of the Gita, comes within nghteousness viz.,
by following the path of righteousness, the principles of the Gita
are followed, and by discharging one’s duty according to the
doctrines of the Gita, the path of righteousness, is followed.

From these words “‘dharmaksetre kuruksetre’ all of us should
know that all actions should be performed by following the path
of righteousness. Every action, should be performed, not with
a selfish motive, but for the welfare of all, and the scriptures
should be the authority in determining what ought to be done
and what ought not to be done (Gita 16/24).

‘Samaveti yuyutsavah’—Duryodhana did not accept the peace
negotiations despite repeated proposals from many kings. Nay,
when Lord Krsna came to intervene as a mediator, Duryodhana
bluntly refused to part with, even as much land as could be covered
by the point of a needle, without waging a war (Mahabharata,
Udyoga. 127/25). Thus, Pandavas had no alternative but to
fight. Thus the two groups assembled to fight for their rights.

Though the two groups assembled to fight, yet Duryodhana
had a keener desire for war, in order to usurp the kingdom by
fair means or foul, just means or unjust viz., by hook or crook.
"
47,"4 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 1
Thus his side was very keen to wage a war.

The Pandavas, had the virtue of righteousness on their side.
For the sake of justice, they were prepared to face any hardship.
Knowing the deadly consequences of a war, Yudhisthira did not
want to indulge in it. But, as by obeying their mother, the five
Pandavas had married Draupadi, Yudhisthira by obeying his

_ mother, became willing to fight.* Thus, Duryodhana, and the
members of his group were eager to fight for usurping the kingdom,
while the Pandavas, were compelled to fight for righteousness.

‘Mamakah pandavascaiva’—The Pandavas, regarded Dhrtarastra
(being the elder brother of their father) as their father, and obeyed
his order, whether it was just or unjust. Therefore, here the word
‘Mamakah’ includes both the Kauravas and the Pandavasf. But
the word ‘Pandava’, has been mentioned separately, because
Dhrtarastra was not fair and just to the Pandavas. He was not.
impartial, he had partiality for his sons. So the word ‘Mamakah’,
has been used for his sons, while ‘Pandava’ has been used for the

* Kunti, the mother of the five Pandavas was very forbearing. She had a

| unique personality. She did not desire worldly pleasures and kingdom. She asked
Lord Krsna to grant her the boon of adversity. But there were two things which
always pinched her. The first of them was that villains such as Duryodhana etc.,
wanted to make her beloved daughter-in-law naked in the assembly. This insulting,
hateful and inhuman behaviour pained her very much. |

Secondly when Lord Krsna on behalf of the Pandavas went to Hastinapura
with a proposal of conciliation, Duryodhana, Duh4sana, Karna and Sakuni etc.,

~ wanted to arrest Him. Hearing this incident, Kunti thought that those villains should
, be killed, otherwise their increasing sins would lead them to damnation. It was
because of these two factors that Kunti ordered her sons, the Pandavas to fight.

+ Though the term ‘Kaurava’ includes both Duryodhana etc., the sons
of Dhrtarastra as well as Yudhisthira etc., the sons of Pandu, yet in this verse
Dhrtarastra has used the term ‘Pandava’ for Yudhisthira etc. So the term “Kaurava’
stands for Duryodhana etc.

+ Dhrtarastra had a partial outlook because he thought that Duryodhana etc.,
were his sons while Yudhisthira etc., were Pandu’s sons. So he never checked
Duryodhana from committing evil deeds such as poisoning Bhima and throwing
him into the water, trying to burn the Pandavas alive in the house made of lac,
gambling with Yudhisthira by foul means, sending an army to the forest to destroy
"
48,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 5
sons of Pandu. Thus, his feelings find expression in his speech.
It was because of his partial attitude, that he had to suffer the
torture of the destruction of his family. Therefore, every human
being should learn a lesson, that he should not be partial to
members of his house, street, village, province, country and sect,
because partiality leads to conflict, rather than love and goodwill.

The term ‘Eva’ (also), with the term ‘Pandavah’ has
been used to point out the fact, that the Pandavas should not
have waged war because they were righteous to the core. But
they also came to the battlefield, to wage war. So what did
they do there?

{‘Mamakah’ and ‘Pandavah’*—Sanjaya will explain the .
word ‘mamakah’, from the second to the thirteenth verses to |
Dhrtarastra. Seeing the army of the Pandavas, his son Duryodhana
told Dronacarya, the names of the chief generals of the Pandava-
army, in order to cause hatred in his mind against the Pandavas.
After that, Duryodhana named the principal warriors of his army,
praised their skill in warfare. In order to please and cheer up
Duryodhana, Bhisma blew his conch loudly. Hearing the sound
of his conch, the conchs and trumpets etc., of the Kaurava-
army blared forth. Then, from the fourteenth to the nineteenth
verses, Safijaya explains the word ‘Pandavah’, as was asked
by Dhrtaradstra. He says, Krsna, a supporter of the Pandavas,
seated in a chariot, blew his conch. After him Arjuna, Bhima,
Yudhisthira, Nakula and Sahadeva etc., also blew their conchs.
The terrible sound of those conchs rent the hearts of the army
of Duryodhana. After that Safijaya, while talking about the
Pandavas, starts the dialogue between Sri Krsna and Arjuna,
from the twentieth verse. ]
the Pandavas and so on. The reason was that Dhrtarastra had the feeling that
somehow or the other if the Pandavas were killed, his sons would rule over the
whole empire. |

* Describing ‘Mamakah’ and ‘Pandavah’ separately Safijaya uses the words
‘Duryodhana’ (1/2) and ‘Pandavah’ (1/14).
"
49,"6 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 1

‘Kimakurvata’—‘Kim’ , has three meanings—doubt, reproach
(blame) and question. : 7

The incident of the war cannot be doubted, because after
ten days of fighting when Bhisma fell off the chariot, Safijaya
conveyed the message to Dhrtarastra, at Hastinapura.

There cannot be reproach (blame) also because Dhrtarastra
did not blame his sons and the Pandavas, for the war, when the
war was already going on. |

Therefore ‘Kim’ means a question here. Dhrtarastra questions _
Sanjaya to relate him all the incidents in details, and in sequence
so that he may understand them properly.

| Appendix—‘My sons’ (mamakah) and ‘Pandu’s sons’
(Pandavah)—this distinction caused attachment—aversion which
led to war and commotion (stir). The result of .Dhrtarastra’s
attachment-aversion was that all the hundred Kauravas were
killed while even a single Pandava was not killed.

As curd is churned, a stir is caused in it by which butter
is extracted, similarly the stir caused by the distinction between
‘my sons’ (mamakah) and ‘Pandu’s sons’ (pandavah) caused
yearning for benediction in Arjuna’s mind by which butter in
the form of the Gita came into light.

It means that the commotion produced in Dhrtarastra’s mind
caused war while the commotion produced in Arjuna’s mind
revealed the Gita.

Safijaya said; :

At that time, seeing the army of the Pandavas drawn up in
battle array, approaching Dronacarya, prince Duryodhana, spoke
the following words. 2
Comment:—

‘Tada’—‘“Tada’, means the time when both the armies
were arrayed and Dhrtarastra was very much anxious to hear
the account of the battlefield.

‘Tu’—Dhrtarastra put the question about his sons and the
sons of Pandu. So Safijaya uses the word ‘Tu’, to tell Dhrtarastra
first about his sons. |

‘Drstva* pandavanikam vyidham’—It means that the army
of the Pandavas was arrayed in good order viz., the warriors

| had no difference in their opinionT. Righteousness, and Lord
Krsna, were in their favour. Therefore, the Pandavas, though
fewer in number, had greater impact. Seeing their army arrayed,
Duryodhana was also influenced. So he, approaching Dronacarya,
spoke prudent and serious words.

‘Raja Duryodhanah’—Duryodhana was called ‘Raja’, the king,
because Dhrtarastra had the greatest attachment and affection for
Duryodhana. Moreover, Duryodhana was the prince. He looked
after the affairs of the empire, while Dhrtarastra was only the
nominal head. Duryodhana was the main cause of the warfare
also. It was because of all these factors, that he was called king
by Safjaya.

* In this chapter the term ‘Drstva’ has been used three times—seeing the
Pandava-army, Duryodhana approaches Dronacarya (1/2); seeing the Kaurava- -
army, Arjuna lifts his bow (1/20); seeing his kith and kin, Arjuna is filled with
extreme passion (1/28). In the first two cases the term ‘Drstva’ has been used for
seeing the army while the third time it has been used for seeing the kith and kin
which changes Arjuna’s feeling.

t There was a difference of opinions inthe Katirava-army because Duryodhana
and Duhsasana etc., wanted to wage the war. But Bhisma, Drona and Vikarna
did not want. And there is a rule that where there is difference in opinions, there
vigour subsides. :
"
51,"8 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 1

‘Acaryamupasangamya’—It seems, that there were three
reasons why Duryodhana approached Dronacarya:—

(i) He went for his selfish interest, so that he could arouse
ill-will in Dronacarya’s heart, against the Pandavas and Dronacarya
might be specially partial to his army. |

(11) It was proper on his part to go to Dronacarya, to express
his regard for him, because he was his preceptor. |

(iii) It is very significant, for the chief warrior not to leave his
position otherwise the whole order of the army is disturbed. So,
it was proper on the part of Duryodhana, to go to Dronacarya.

| Here a question may be raised that, Duryodhana should have
first of all approached Bhisma because Bhisma was the commander
supreme. Then, why did he approach Dronacarya? The answer
is, that Drona and Bhisma both loved the Pandavas, and the
Kauravas, but Drona had special kindness and love for Arjuna.
Moreover, Duryodhana had a pupil-preceptor relationship with
Drona, but he had no family relationship with him. Therefore,
it was proper on his part to go to Drona, to please him. In
practical life also it is seen that a man for his selfish interest,
tries to please a person who is not closely related to him, by
offering him regard. |

Duryodhana thought, that Bhisma was his grandfather. So
it was easy to please him, even if he was displeased, because
of his family relationship. So Bhisma, also loved him very
much. Bhisma, blew his conch loudly, to please and cheer up
Duryodhana (1/12).

‘Vacanamabravit’—Here, it was sufficient to use the word

' *Abravit’ (spoke), which also includes “Vacanam’ (words). So

: there was no need to use the word “Vacanam’. Even then,
the term “Vacanam’ has been used, which shows that Duryodhana

spoke prudent and meaningful words, in order to arouse ill-will

in Dronacarya’s heart, against the Pandavas and to win his
favour, so that he could fight whole-heartedly, on the Kauravas
"
52,"Verse 3] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 9

side and they would gain victory. Thus the term ‘“Vacanam’ was

used with a selfish motive. _ - |

words:— : - 7

Behold, O Master, this mighty army of the sons of Pandu,
arrayed for battle by your talented pupil Dhrstadyumna, the son
of Drupada. 3 . |
Comment: -

‘Acarya’—-By addressing Drona as ‘Acarya’, it seems that
Duryodhana means to say that he is the preceptor, who taught
the Kauravas and the Pandavas, the science of warfare. So he
should not be partial, to either of the groups. .

‘Tava Sisyena dhimata—By this phrase Duryodhana means,
that Drona is so simple hearted, that he has taught the science
of warfare to Dhrstadyumna, Drupada’s son, who is born to
kill him (Drona), and who is so clever, that he is determined to
vanquish and kill none other than, his own preceptor. |

‘Drupadaputrena’—It means that Drupada, with the motive
of getting your honour killed, got a holy sacrifice performed, by
the two Brahmanas (men of the priest-class) named, Yaja and
Upayaja, and thus Dhrstadyumna, was born. The same Dhrstadyumna
was standing before him, as commander of the rival army.

Though Duryodhana, could speak the word Dhrstadyumna
instead of ‘Drupadaputra’, the son of Drupada, yet he intentionally
used “‘Drupadaputrena’, to remind Dronacarya of the enmity that
Drupada, had with him. So he really meant that it was a good
"

opportunity, to take a revenge. | : -

‘Panduputranam, etam vyidham mahatim camiim paSya’—
Behold the mighty army of the Pandavas, arrayed for battle by
the son of Drupada. It means that Duryodhana wants to say, “O
master, the Pandavas, whom you love, have made the son of
Drupada, the general of their army so that he may kill you. Had
they loved you, they would never have appointed him as a general.”

Though the army of the Kauravas, was larger than that of
the Pandavas, the army of the Kauravas was eleven ‘Aksauhini*,
while that of the Pandavas was only seven ‘Aksauhini’, yet
the army of the Pandavas seemed to Duryodhana, larger than
what it actually was. The army of the Pandavas, seemed more
formidable to Duryodhana because:—

(i) It was arrayed in such a manner, that even a small army
seemed larger to Duryodhana. | _

(ii) All the warriors of the Pandavas army, were united and
of one mind. So it seemed greater in strength and enthusiasm.

Drawing Drona’s attention to the army of the Pandavas,
Duryodhana wants to say to Dronacarya, that he should not regard
the army of the rival group as ordinary (small). He should fight
with all his might. and it would not be difficult for him to defeat
the son of Drupada, because he was his pupil. _.

‘Etarn paSya’, means that the army of the Pandavas 1s arrayed
for the battle. So you should take a quick decision how to get
victory over them. 3

Abhimanyu, the son of Subhadra and the five sons of Draupadi,
are also there. All of them are great chariot-warriors. 4—6
Comment:— - .

‘Atra §ira mahesvasa bhimarjunasama yudhi’—Those who
possess large bows and shoot with bows and arrows, are called
‘Mahesvasa (the mighty archers). They are very valiant and
extraordinary warriors. In warfare, they are as strong as Bhima,
and in the use of weapons and missiles such as bows and arrows
etc., as good as Arjuna.

‘Yuyudhanah’—Yuyudhana (Satyaki), learnt the science of
warfare, from Arjuna. Thus he was obliged to him, that he did
not go to the side of Duryodhana, even though Lord Krsna had
given Duryodhana, his Narayani army. In order to arouse malice
in the mind of Dronacarya,. Duryodhana, first of all, mentions
"
55,"12 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter ]
the name of Yuyudhana, the disciple to Arjuna. He means to
say, “You have taught Arjuna archery and granted him the
boon that you would try that he would be a matchless archer,
in this world (Mahabharata, Adi. 131/27). Thus you have so
much love for him. But he is so ungrateful, that he is arrayed
in the army against you, while Arjuna’s disciple Yuyudhana is
arrayed. on his side.” : |

[Yuyudhana was not killed in the warfare but in a mutual
fight-among the Yadavas.}

‘Virata$ca’—Duryodhana says, “It was Virata, who was
responsible for insulting the warrior, Susarma. Again, it
was because of him, that you became unconscious with the
Sammohana (beguiling) weapon, and we had to flee from the
battlefield, leaving behind his cows. The same king Virata is
opposing you.”

Dronacarya had no enmity or malice against king Virata. But
Duryodhana thinks that if he names Drupada after Yuyudhana,
Dronacarya may think, that Duryodhana is instigating him to
fight against the Pandavas, and he is arousing feelings of enmity
with them. So Duryodhana names Virata before Drupada, so that
Dronacarya may not see through his trick, and may fight bravely.

[King Virata and his three sons, named Uttara, Sveta, Sankha
were killed, in the war of Mahabharata. ]

‘Drupadasca maharathah—Duryodhana says, “You reminded
Drupada of your old friendship but he insulted you in the assembly,
saying that he was a king and you a beggar, and thus there was
no question of any friendship between him and you, and beget a
son who would kill you. The same great chariot-warrior, named
Drupada is arrayed to fight against you.”

[King Drupada, was killed in the warfare by Dronacarya.]

‘Dhrstaketuh’—How foolish this Dhrstaketu is, that he is
fighting on the side of Sri Krsna, who killed his father Sisupala,

with a disc, in the assembly. :

[Dhrstaketu was killed by Dronacarya.]

‘Cekitanah’— The entire yadava-army is ready to fight on our
side, but that solitary yadava is fighting on the side of Pandavas.

{Cekitana was killed by Duryodhana.]

‘Kasirajasca viryavan’—This king of Kasi is very valiant, a
great chariot-warrior and is fighting on the side of the Pandavas,
so be careful, as you have a very formidable foe to deal with.

[The king of Kasi was killed, in the battle of Mahabharata. ]

‘Purujitkuntibhojasca°—Though both Puryjit and Kuntibhoja,

yet being partial, they are arrayed to fight against us.

Dronacarya. } : :

an eye on them. |

{[Yudhamanyu and Uttamauja, were slain in their sleep, by
A&svatthama. ] |

‘Saubhadrah’—He is Abhimanyu, the son to Krsna’s sister
named Subhadra. He is very brave. He learnt the art of piercing
an array of soldiers, standing in the form of a circle, while he
was in his mother’s womb. So beware of him. :

[Abhimanyu was killed by Duhsasana’s son, when he unjustly
hit him, with a mace on the head.]

‘Draupadeyasca’—Draupadi, gave birth to five sons named

Prativindhya, Sutasoma, Srutakarma, Satanika and Srutasena
respectively, from Yudhisthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and
Sahadeva. Watch her five sons, carefully. She openly insulted me
in the assembly. So avenge that insult, by killing her five sons.

[Asvatthama killed the five sons, while they were asleep at night. ]

‘Sarva eva maharathah’—All of them are great chariot-
wattiors. They are well-versed in the scripture and in the use
of arms (A great chariot-warrior is, one who can manage ten
thousand archers). There is a large number of such great chariot-
warriors, in the army of the Pandavas.

Link:—Duryodhana described valour, bravery and skill of
the army of the Pandavas, in warfare so that hatred might be
aroused in Dronacarya, against the Pandavas, and he might be

that Drona was at heart partial to the Pandavas. So he might

make a peace-treaty, with the Pandavas. As soon as, this thought

| came to his mind,he described the heroes of his side, who were
very well trained in warfare, in the next three verses.

Comment:— .

'Asmakam tu visista ye tannibodha dvijottama'—Duryodhana
says to Dronacarya, ""O best of the twice-born, you should know
that in our army also, there are great chariot-warriors, who are
"
58,"Verse 7} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI - 15
in no way less valiant and less trained in warfare, rather they
are more valiant and better trained.” -

In the third verse ‘Pasya’, and here ‘Nibodha' verbs, are used
because the army of the Pandavas is standing in front of them,
therefore Duryodhana uses the verb 'PaSya’ (behold). But the army
of Kauravas, is not in front of Dronacarya, it is on the side of
his back. So Duryodhana, uses the verb 'Nibodha' (Know).

‘Nayakaé mama sainyasya safijhartham tanbravimi te'—I
mention the names of the chief generals, marshals and great
chariot-warriors of my army, to draw your attention to them.

‘Saiijiiartham’ means, that there are innumerable generals,
who cannot be named easily. Therefore, I am just drawing your
attention, as you know all of them.

In this verse, Duryodhana probably wants to say, that his |
side is in no way weaker than that of the Pandavas, but is rather
stronger, yet according to political prudence however weak the
army of an enemy may be; it should not be regarded as weak.
Therefore, one should not have in the least, a feeling of neglect
and indifference, towards the enemy. So Duryodhana already
described the warriors of the other side, to make Drona careful
and now he is giving the names of the warriors of his army.

Secondly, after seeing the army of the Pandavas compact
and well disciplined, Duryodhana was overawed and also
somewhat afraid. The reason was, that in spite of being smaller
there were several righteous persons, and as also Lord Krsna
Himself, in that army. Righteous persons and God bear their
influence on all the creatures, including those having the most
sinful conduct, and even on animals, birds, trees and plants. The
reason is, that God and righteousness are eternal, while all the
temporal powers are transient. Therefore, Duryodhana is also
influenced by the army of the Pandavas. But because of the
material and temporal power, he wants to assure Dronacarya,
that their army is superior to that of the Pandavas. Therefore,
they can easily gain victory over the army, of the Pandavas.

Yourself, Bhisma, Karna and Krpa ever victorious in battle;

and ASvatthama, Vikarna and Saumadatti (Bhirisrava), the son

of Somadatta. 8 |

Comment:— |
'Bhavanbhismasca'—You and Bhisma both are unique. So if

you fight with your full vigour, neither the gods, genies, devils,

nor men can encounter you. Both of you are famous for your
valour throughout the world. Bhisma has been a celibate since
birth and he cannot be killed, without his own will. |
[In the Mahabharata, Dronacarya was killed by Dhrstadyumna,
while Bhisma died during summer solstice, of his own free will.]
'Karnasca'—Karna is very brave. I believe, that he by himself
can gain a victory over the army of the Pandavas. Even Arjuna,
is no match for. him. Such a valiant warrior is standing on our

‘side. 7
[Karna was killed by Arjuna, in the war of Mahabharata.]

-'Krpasca samitifijayah'—Krpa, is immortal.* He is our well-
wisher and can gain victory over the whole army of the Pandavas.

Though Duryodhana, after mentioning the names of Dronacarya

and Bhisma, should have named Krpacarya. Yet, Duryodhana

had more faith in Karna, than in Krpacarya. So Karna's name
was spontaneously uttered by him. But he wanted to please

Dronacarya and Bhisma by calling Krpacarya, as ever victorious

in battle, lest they should regard it as an insult to Krpacarya.
'‘ASvatthama'—He is also immortal. Being your son, he is
* Agvatthama, Bali, Vedavyasa, Hanuman, Vibhisana, Krpa (Krpacarya),

Parasurama and Markandeya—these eight are immortal. In the scripture it

is written.
"
60,"Verse 9] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 17
very valiant. He is well versed in the science of warfare as he
has learnt it, from you. : | oO '

'Vikarnasca saumadattistathaiva ca'—You should not think |
that only the Pandavas are righteous. On our side, my brother
Vikarna is also very righteous and brave. Similarly Bhurisrava,
the grandson of our great grandfather's brother, Bahlika and the
son of Somadatta, is also very righteous. He has also performed
several holy sacrifices, by offering great gifts. He is also a very
brave and great chariot-warrior.

[In the warfare, Vikarna was killed by Bhima, and Bhurisrava
was killed by Satyaki.]

Here, by mentioning these names Duryodhana means to say,
""O preceptor (Acarya), in our army, there are so many valiant

_ warriors, such as you, Bhisma, Karna, Krpacarya etc., while in
the army of the Pandavas, such valiant warriors are not seen. In
our army, two great warriors named Krpacarya and Aésvatthama
are immortal, while in the army of the Pandavas there is none.
Moreover, in our army there is no scarcity of righteous persons,
therefore, we need not be afraid of them. |

Comment:—

'Anye ca bahavah Stra madarthe tyaktajivitah'— Besides the
above-mentioned heroes, there are many great chariot-warriors, such
as Bahlika, Salya, Bhagadatta, Jayadratha etc., in our army, who
"

have come here to fight, by staking their lives for me. They may be
killed in the war, but they will not run away from the battlefield.
How should I express my hearty thankfulness, to them before you?

‘Nanasastrapraharanah sarve yuddhavisaradah'—All these
heroes are experts in the use of weapons, such as swords, maces,
tridents and missiles, such as arrows and javelins etc. They are
in everyway, experts in the science of warfare.’

Link:—When Duryodhana by his cleverness could not deceive
Dronacarya, who did not say anything, he had a second thought.
This thought is described by Sanjaya in the next verse.*

aparyaptam tadasmakam balan bhismabhiraksitam
paryaptam tvidametesam balam bhimabhiraksitam

Our army is inadequate and is easier to be conquered, as it is
protected by Bhisma (a well-wisher of both the armies). But their
army marshalled by Bhima, is unconquerable (because Bhima
guards it well). 10 |
Comment:—

'Apary4ptam tadasmakam balam  bhismabhiraksitam'—
Duryodhana thinks about his army because of unrighteousness
and injustice, Duryodhana is afraid that, ""Our army though larger
than that of the Pandavas, is easier to be conquered, because
our army is unwieldy, indisciplined, disunited and faint-hearted,
while the army of the Pandavas, is compact, disciplined, united
and fearless. The chief protector of our army is Bhisma, who
is friendly to both the armies. He, is a great devotee of Krsna
He, in his heart has great respect for Yudhisthira and love for

* Safijaya by means of the divine insight he was endowed with by Sage Vyasa,
was able to know even the minds of the warriors (Mahabharata, Bhisma. 2/11).

Arjuna. Therefore, though outwardly, he is on our side; yet at
heart, he is a well-wisher of the Pandavas. He is the field-marshal
of our army. Under these circumstances, how can our army gain
victory, over the Pandavas?  ieit«w™” a |

'Paryaptam tvidametesam balam bhimabhiraksitam'— But, this
army of the Pandavas can be victorious over our army, very
easily because all the warriors of their army are united, without
having any difference of opinions. The protector of their army,
is Bhima who 1s brave and who has always defeated me, since
childhood. He has taken a pledge to kill all the hundred brothers
including me, he is bent on destroying us. His body is as strong
and hard as an adamant. I poisoned him but it did not kill him.
Having such a protector as Bhima, the army of the Pandavas is
certainly capable of gaining victory over our army.

Here, a doubt may arise that Duryodhana named Bhisma, who
was their field-marshal in defence of their army, but he named
Bhima, who was not a field-marshal in defence of the army of
the Pandavas. The answer is, that at that ttme Duryodhana was
not thinking about the field-marshals, but about the strength
of the two armies. Duryodhana, was very much influenced by
Bhima's power, so he named Bhima, as the protector of the
army of the Pandavas. :

Arjuna, beholding the army of the Kauravas raises his
bow (Gita 1/20), while Duryodhana, seeing the army of the
Pandavas approaches Dronacarya and requests him to watch
the army of Pandavas, arrayed for battle. It proves that
Duryodhana's mind has been. by fear-struck.* Though afraid,

* When the conchs of the army of the Kauravas blared forth, their sound had
no effect on the army of the Pandavas. But when the conchs of the army of the
Pandavas blared forth, their sound rent the hearts of Duryodhana etc., (1/13,19).

It proves that by following the path of injustice and unrighteousness the
hearts of Duryodhana etc., had become weak and horror-struck.
"
63,"20 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 1
yet with his cleverness he wants to please Dronacarya, and
instigate him, against the Pandavas. The reason is, that in
Duryodhana's heart, there are unrighteousness, injustice and
sin, and it is a rule that an unrighteous, unjust and sinful
person cannot live, happily and peacefully. On the other
hand, in Arjuna's heart there are righteousness and justice.
So he does not play any trick and have any fear to serve
his self-interest. He is fearless, courageous and brave. That
is why, he orders Lord Krsna, ""O Krsna, place my chaniot,
between the two armies"" (1/21). It means that a person, who
depends on perishable riches and property, etc., and whose
heart is full of unrighteousness, injustice and ill-feeling, does
not possess real power. He is hollow from within, and 1s
never fearless. On the other hand one who depends on God
and follows righteousness, is never fearful. His power is real,
and he always remains free from cares and fears. Therefore,
strivers, who aspire for God-realization should perform their
duty by depending only on God, and for His sake, renounce
unrighteousness, and injustice etc. They should never follow the
path of unrighteousness, by attaching importance to material
prosperity and contact-born pleasures, because these two lead
men to damnation, rather than to peace.

Appendix—Arjuna, instead of accepting the Lord’s Narayani
army well-equipped with arms and ammunition, accepted unarmed
Lord Krsna* while Duryodhana in place of Lord Krsna accepted
His Narayani army. It means that Aruna had an eye on Lord
Krsna while Duryodhana had an eye on His stately power.
The heart of the person, who has an eye on God, is strong
because God’s strength is real. But the heart of the person who

*evamuktastu krsnena kuntiputro dhanajfijayah

ayudhyamanam sangrame varayamasa keSavam (Maha. Udyoga. 7/21)

**When Lord Krsna said so, Anjuna, Kunti’s son in the battlefield instead of
accepting the Lord’s one Aksauhini army, accepted unarmed Lord Krsna as his
helper who wouldn't fight in the war.”’
"

has an eye on worldly power is weak as the strength of the :
world is unreal. |
Link:—Now Duryodhana to please Bhisma instructs all the
great chariot-warriors of his army, and says:— |

bhiraksantu bhavantah sarva eva hi'—All of you (warriors),
stationed in your respective position on different fronts, should —
guard Bhisma on all sides. ,
By saying the above words, Duryodhana wants to please
Bhisma, so that he may be partial to his army. Secondly, he
gives instruction to the warriors of his army, to see that Sikhandi
should not face Bhisma. If Sikhandi comes in front of Bhisma,
the latter will not use his arms and weapons against him, because
he was a woman in the previous birth. In that birth also, first he
was a woman and later he changed into a man. So Bhisma,
by regarding him as a woman, has promised not to fight with
Sikhandi. Sikhandi, had taken birth by Lord Siva's boon, to kill
Bhisma. Therefore, if Bhisma is protected from Sikhandi, he
will kill all other warriors of the army of Pandavas, and their
victory is certain. Therefore, Duryodhana ° gives instruction to
all the great chariot-warriors of his army, to guard Bhisma.

affection for him, cheers him up. This is expressed by Satijaya,
: in the next verse. _

The grand old man of the Kaurava race, their glorious grand-
: uncle Bhisma, cheering Duryodhana roared loudly like a lion, and
| blew. his conch. 12
Comment:— : ,
""Tasya saiijanayanharsam'—Here, it should have been said,
that Bhisma blew his conch and.it cheered Duryodhana. But it
| is said that Bhisma, cheering up Duryodhana, blew his conch.
Sanjaya wants to state that the very action of blowing the conch, |
will certainly cheer up Duryodhana. To express this influence of
Bhisma, Sanjaya uses the adjective ‘Pratapavan' (glorious).
""Kuruvrddhah'—Though in the Kuru race Bahlika (the younger
brother of Bhisma's father Santanu), was older than Bhisma, yet
Bhisma, possessed better knowledge of righteousness and God,
than all other old members, in the race. So Safijaya, calls him
'Kuruvrddhah’, (the grand old man of the Kaurava race).
""Pratapavan'— Bhisma was well-known for his renunciation
of wealth and woman i.e., he did not accept any kingdom nor did
he marry. He was well-versed in military science and scriptures.
So the warrior class were very much influenced by him.
When Bhisma for his brother Vicitravirya kidnapped all
by himself, the daughters of the king of Kasi, from the place
where their suitors had assembled to marry them, the Ksatriya
suitors attacked him, but he alone defeated all of them. He was
so well-versed, in the science of weapons and warfare, that he
did not accept his defeat even against his preceptor Parasurama,
"
66,"Verse 12] -SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI _ 23
who had taught him the science of weapons etc. Thus he had
great influence over the Ksatriyas (warrior class), because of his
skill in military science. |
When Bhisma was lying on a bed of arrows Lord Krsna
said to Yudhisthira, ""If you want to put any question on
righteousness (Dharma), ask him now, because the sun of the |
knowledge of scriptures, is going to set, 1.e., Bhisma, a great
scholar of scriptures is going to die.""* Thus, we see that he had
great mastery over the scriptures and others were very much
influenced by this knowledge.
'Pitamahah'—This word seems to mean that Dronacarya did
not attach any importance to the tricks played by Duryodhana.
He understood that Duryodhana wanted to deceive him. So he
remained silent. But Bhisma is the grand-uncle of Duryodhana.
So he sees Duryodhana's child-like behaviour, in his tricks. Hence ,
Bhisma unlike Dronacarya, breaks his silence and blows his conch
to cheer up Duryodhana, and show his affection for him.
'‘Simnhanadam vinadyoccaih Sankham dadhmau'—When a lion
roars ferociously, even large wild animals like elephants etc., get
horror-struck. Similarly, by roaring ferociously, Bhisma blew
his conch to cheer up Duryodhana, and terrorise the warriors,
of the hostile army. : :
-  Appendix—Duryodhana’s relationship with Dronacarya
was that of pupil-teacher while with Bhisma he had the family
relationship. Where there is the pupil-teacher relationship, there
is no partiality but in family relationship because of the affection
for the family, partiality ensues. Therefore having heard the
tricky words uttered by Duryodhana, Dronacarya remained quiet
which discouraged Duryodhana. But because of family-affection,
having seen Duryodhana sad, Bhisma blew the conch in order
_ to encourage Duryodhana.

Then conchs, kettledrums, tabors, drums and cow-horns,
suddenly blared forth and the noise was tumultuous. 13
Comment:— Oo

'Tatah Sankhasca bheryasca panavanakagomukhah'—Bhisma
had not blown his conch to declare war, his purpose was to
cheer up Duryodhana, but the army of the Kauravas thought
that the war was declared. So hearing the sound of the conch,
all musical instruments such as conchs etc., of the Kaurava-army

| suddenly blared forth. —

Conchs are found in the sea. These are blown in adoration
of God, on auspicious occasions and for declaring a war. ‘Kettle-
drums’ (bheri), are drums with large hollow bowls of iron, with
tops made of skins of buffaloes and are beaten with a wooden stick.
They are kept in temples and forts, and are beaten, specially on
functions and auspicious occasions. ""Tabors’ (panava), are small
drums like a tambourine. These are made of iron or wood, with
tops covered by the skin of goats, and are beaten with hand ora
wooden stick. Their beating is regarded as auspicious, as adoration
to Lord Ganeéga. 'Anaka' (drum), is a musical instrument made
of clay, with the top covered by leather and beaten with a hand.
‘Gomukha' (cow-horn), is a musical wind instrument, consisting
of a long metal tube usually bent like a serpent, having a cow
shaped mouth and is blown with the mouth.

'Sahasaivabhyahanyanta’*—Kaurava-army was full of great

their musical instruments suddenly blared forth, all at once
without much effort. :

tatah Svetairhayairyukte mahati syandane sthitau

madhavah pandavascaiva divyau sankhau pradadhmatuh

Then, seated in a glorious chariot drawn by white horses, Sri
Krsna as well as Arjuna, blew their divine conchs. 14
Comment:— /

'Tatah §vetairhayairyukte'—The Gandharva (a celestial .
musician) named Citraratha gave Arjuna, one hundred divine
horses. It was ordained that they would always remain one
hundred in number even though many of them were killed, on
the battlefield. They could go to heaven or live on the earth.
Out of these, one hundred horses, four beautiful and well-trained
horses, were harnessed to Arjuna's chariot.

_ 'Mahati syandane sthitau'—The Fire-god (Agni) suffered
from indigestion because a lot of ‘ghee’ (clarified butter) was
offered in a holy sacrifice to him. Therefore, though the fire-god
wanted to cure his indigestion by consuming medicinal herbs of
"
69,"| 26 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 1
| the Khandava forest, but he was unable to do it because it was
: protected by other gods. Whenever he tried to burn it, ‘Indra’,
the king of the gods extinguished the fire with the rain. At last,
with Arjuna's help Agni cured his indigestion, by burning the
whole forest and being pleased with Arjuna, Agni gave him a
very large and glorious chariot. As many weapons and missiles
| as could be accommodated in nine bullock carts, were held in
- it. It was gilded and glorious. Its wheels were strong and huge.
It's flag, shone like lightning over about a ""Yojana (eight miles),
| in distance. In spite of being so long it was neither heavy, nor
| could, it stop or be entangled in trees etc., Hanuman (the monkey-
god, who acted as a spy in Rama's march against Ravana), was

the emblem on the flag.

'Sthitau'—'Sthitau' means, that the beautiful and glorious
chariot became. more so, because Lord Krsna Himself, and His
dear devotee Arjuna, were sitting in it. |

_ ""Madhavah pandavascaiva'—'Ma' is Laksmi, the goddess of
wealth and prosperity, and 'Dhava,' is the husband or owner.
Therefore, 'Madhava' means the Lord of Laksmi, Sd Krsna, the
incarnation of Lord Visnu. Here, Pandava, has been used for

| Arjuna, because he is the chief among the Pandavas—'Pandavanarn
| Dhanaiijayah; (Gita 10/37). [Lord Krsna says, ""Among the Pandavas,

I am Dhanaiijaya (Arjuna).]"" (He has been called chief among the
Pandavas, because he had no individuality, apart from Lord Krsna.)

Arjuna and Sti Krsna were the incarnations of ‘Nara’ and
‘Narayana’, respectively. In the beginning of every ‘Parva’ (section)
of Mahabharata, there is salutation to Nara (Arjuna) and Narayana
(Lord Krsna). Thus, from this point of view also, Lord Krsna
and Arjuna both, were chiefs. Sanjaya also says in the last verse
of the Gita, ""Wherever there is Sri Krsna, the Lord of Yoga,
and wherever is Arjuna, the wielder of the bow (Gandiva bow),
there are prosperity, victory, glory and righteousness; this is my
conviction"" (18/78).
"
70,"Verse 15] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 27

'‘Divyau Sankhau pradadhmatuh'—Lord Krsna and Arjuna,
loudly blew their conchs, which were glorious and divine.. _

Here, it. may be stated, that it was proper on the part of
Bhisma to blow his conch first, because he was the field-marshal
of the Kaurava-army. But how far was it justified on the part of
Lord Krsna, the chariot-driver of the Pandava-army, to blow the
conch, when the field-marshal, Dhrstadyumna of the Pandava-
army, was there? The answer, is that Lord Krsna is ever chief,
whether He works as a chariot-driver or a great chariot-warrior. He
is ever great, whatever the rank He may hold, because His rank
is 'Acyuta’ (fixed), He never deviates from his divine nature. In
Pandava-army, Lord Krsna was the chief and director. Even when,
he was a boy, Nanda and Upananda etc., obeyed him. Therefore,
they, by obeying him, started to worship Govardhana, (a mountain),
instead of Indra, the king of gods, who had been worshipped for
generations. It means, that the Lord, in whatever state, place and
circumstance, He may live, is ever the chief. Therefore, Lord
Krsna was the first in the Pandava-army, to blow his conch.

One, who is really inferior, regards himself as superior, after
getting an appointment to a high post. On the contrary, one who
is really superior is superior everywhere, and he elevates the
post, at which he works. Thus, Lord Krsna, while working as a
chariot-driver, elevated that post.

Link:—Sanjaya in the next four verses, in explaining the
previous verse and giving: some more details, describes the
blowing of conchs by ather warriors. :

-  HrsikeSa (Sri Krsna), blew his conch named PaAiicajanya,
Dhanafijaya (Arjuna), his conch called Devadatta; while Vrkodara
(Bhima), of terrific deeds, blew his mighty conch the Paundra. 15
Comment:— |

""Paiicajanyam hrsikesah'— Hrsikesa’, means the master of mind
and senses, Lord Krsna who pervades the mind and intellect
of all viz., who is acquainted with the hearts of all the people,
arranged on the side of the Pandavas, blew his conch named
Paficajanya. Lord Krsna having killed demon named Paijicajana
who appeared in the form of a conch, used him as a conch. So
His conch was named as 'Pajicajanya.”

'Devadattam dhanafijayah'—The word ‘Dhanafjaya means
conqueror of wealth. At the time of the holy sacrifice named
Rajasttya, Arjuna took over wealth of many rulers on gaining
victory, over them. So Arjuna was called 'Dhanajfijaya.* Indra, the

_ king of gods, gave Arjuna the conch named Devadatta, while he
was fighting with demons named Nivatakavaca etc. It produced
such a loud and horrifying sound that the army of the enemies
became terror-struck. This conch was blown by Arjuna. —

'Paundram dadhmau mahasankham bhimakarma vrkodarah'—
Bhima, was named 'Bhimakarma (doer of tremendous deeds)
because he killed demons, such as Hidimba, Baka and Jata etc.,
and valiant warriors, such as Kicaka and Jarasandha etc. In his

- belly, besides the heat which helps to digest food, there was a
special fire, named 'Vrka’ which digested a lot of food, very easily.
It was because of his great digestive power, that he was named
""Vrkodara.’ Thus, Bhima who was the doer of terrific deeds and
possessed strong digestive power, blew his mighty conch, Paundra.

sahadevasca sughosamanipuspakau'—Arjuna, Bhima and

Sahadeva were Madri's sons. So the adjective 'Kuntiputra’ (Kunti's

sons) has been used for Yudhisthira. |
Yudhisthira has been called a king because he was the ruler

of half of the Indraprastha kingdom before exile and according
to the promise and the law, he should have been a king after
living in exile for twelve years and one year's incognito residence.

Moreover, by calling him a king, Safijaya wanted to hint that he

would be the king of the entire territory afterwards.

prthak'—The great chariot-warrior Sikhandi, was very
brave. He in his previous birth was a woman, (the daughter
named Amba of the king of Kasi), and in this birth also, was
born as a daughter to king Drupada. Afterwards, she became
a man by getting manhood from a genie, named Sthunakarna.
Bhisma knew all this and therefore, he regarded him as a woman,
and did not shoot arrows at him. Arjuna while fighting kept
Sikhandi ahead, shot arrows at Bhisma and overthrew him from
the chariot.

Arjuna’s son Abhimanyu, was very brave. In warfare, he
killed many warriors, by entering the array of soldiers stationed,
in the form of a circle formed by Drona. At last, six great chariot-
warriors of the army of Kauravas, surrounding him by foul means,
attacked him with weapons and missiles. He was killed, when
Duhsasana's son, hit him on the head, with a mace.

Saiyaya, mentioned only one warrior named Bhisma, who
blew his conch from the Kaurava-army, while he mentioned
eighteen warnors, such as Lord Krsna, Arjuna, Bhima etc.,
from the Pandava-army. It seems that Safijaya, did not want to
describe the unrighteous side of the Kaurava-army, in detail.
But, he had great regard for Lord Krsna, the Pandavas and the
Pandava-army, because of their righteousness. So he thought it
proper, to describe the warriors of Pandava-army, in more detail
and he took delight in describing them.

of the conchs on the Kaurava-army.

sa ghoso dhartarastranam hrdayani vyadarayat

nabhasca prthivim caiva tumulo vyanunadayan

The terrible din, echoing through the sky and the earth, rent
the hearts of Dhrtarastra's sons, who had usurped the kingdom
by unjust means. 19
Comment:— |

‘Sa ghoso dhartarastranam hrdayani vyadarayat nabhaSca
prthivim caiva tumulo vyanunadayan’'—The sounds of the conchs
of the Pandava-army, was so thunderous, roaring and horrifying,
that it echoed through the sky and the earth, and rent the hearts
of the Kauravas, who had usurped the empire, and also of the
kings, who had come to fight on their side. It means, that, as
a weapon or a missile, rends the heart and causes it pain so
does, the sound of the these conchs. That sound discouraged
the Kaurava-army and its warriors were horror-struck, at the
formidable strength of the Pandava-army.

Sanjaya was relating the incidents to Dhrtarastra. So it seems
that it was not proper on his part to mention, 'Dhartarastranam’
(Dhrtarastra's sons). He should have mentioned ‘Tavakinanam’'
(his sons and relatives), which would have been polite. But he
used the word correctly, because it was justified on his part to
use it as he meant to say, that his sons usurped the kingdom.
Their hearts were rent, because they were unrighteous. Therefore
the use of the word is justified further.

_ Here a question may arise why there was no effect of the
sound of the war instruments, such as conchs etc., of the eleven
Aksauhini army (In an Aksauhini army there are 109350 foot
soldiers, 65610 horses, 21870 chariots and 21870 elephants) of
the Kauravas* on the Pandava-army, but the sound of the conchs

* It was impossible for Duryodhana to have such a large eleven Aksauhint
"
75,"32 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 1
of seven Aksauhini army of the Pandavas rent the hearts of the
Kaurava-army. The answer is that the hearts of those who are
righteous and just, are impregnable. Pandavas had ruled over
the empire with justice and righteousness, before their exile
and also demanded their empire from the Kauravas, which was
a just demand. On the other hand, the hearts of those who are
unrighteous, unjust and sinful, are weak, doubtful and full of
fear. It is their sin or injustice, which weakens their hearts.
Duryodhana and his group, tried their best to kill Pandavas, by
any means—fair or foul. They usurped their empire and caused
them much trouble. ‘Thus, they stood for unrighteousness. So the
sound of the conchs of seven Aksauhini army of the Pandavas,
rent their hearts, with a piercing pain.

This incident, warns a striver, that he should never have
unjust and unrighteous dealings, through his body, speech and
mind, because these weaken the heart and create fear, in it. For
example, the creatures of the world, including the gods and the
demons, were afraid of Ravana, the king of Lanka. But when
he abducted Sita, he being terrified, looked here and there, to
see if anyone was watching him (Manasa 3/28/4-5).

PII EES

Link:—In the first verse, Dhrtarastra put a question, about
his -sons and sons of Pandu. Sanjaya answered the question,
from the second to the nineteenth verse. Now Sanjaya starts
army. But when the Pandavas were exiled, Duryodhana adopted the policy of
Yudhisthira. As Yudhisthira ruled over the subjects with justice and righteousness
to give them comfort, thinking it his duty, Duryodhana also did the same to establish
his influence over them. It was because of his good behaviour towards the people
for thirteen years that the army which liked the Pandavas, came over to his side.
Thus he could win the confidence of nine Aksauhini army because of his good
behaviour. Lord Krsna gave him one Aksauhini army. Moreover he tricked one
Aksauhini army of king Salya of Madra to his side which had been on the side
of the Pandavas. Therefore on the side of the Kauravas there was an army eleven
Aksauhini in number while on the Pandava side it was seven Aksauhint1.

Pandava (Arjuna) whose ensign bears the Hanuman, lifting his
bow, spoke the following words, to Krsna. 20
Comment:— a : |

'‘Atha'—This word means, that now Sanjaya begins the
Bhagavadgita, in the form of a dialogue between Lord Krsna
and Arjuna. This dialogue, ends with the word 'Tti’ used in the
seventy-fourth verse of the eighteenth chapter. Similarly, the gospel
of the Gita begins, with the eleventh verse of the second chapter, -
and ends with sixty-sixth verse of the eighteenth chapter.

'Pravrtte Sastrasampate'—Though Bhisma had blown his conch
to cheer up Duryodhana, not to declare war, yet the Kaurava and
Pandava armies thought that the war had been declared, and so
they became ready with weapons and missiles in their hands.
Seeing them equipped with weapons and missiles, Arjuna also
lifted his bow, named Gandiva.

'Vyavasthitan dhartarastran drstva'—-By these words Safijaya
means, ""When your son Duryodhana saw the army of Pandavas, he
fled to Dronacarya. But when Arjuna saw the army of Kauravas,
he lifted his bow."" 'Dhanurudyamya’ (took his bow)—it shows,
that Duryodhana was filled with fear, while Arjuna was fearless,
courageous and valiant. | |
"
77,"34 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 1
‘Kapidhvajah'—By using this epithet 'Kapidhvajah', Sanjaya
wants to remind Dhrtarastra of Hanuman, sitting on the banner
of Arjuna’s chariot. When Pandavas used to live in the forest,
one day suddenly, the wind dropped a divine lotus having a
thousand leaves before Draupadi. She was very much pleased
to see it, and she said to Bhima, ""O excellent among the brave,
bring me several lotuses of this kind.” Bhima, started to satisfy
her desire. When he reached the Kadali forest, he happened to
meet Hanuman. Both of them talked about many things. At last
Hanuman desired to grant him a boon. Bhima said, ""May your
kindness continue to be with me!"" Hanuman said, ""O son of wind-
god, when uneasy by being injured with arrows and weapons,
enter the army of the enemy and make a roar, I'll enhance that
roar by adding my own power to it. Moreover, by sitting on the
banner of Arjuna's chariot I'll make such a roar, that it will be
deadly terrifying to your enemy, and you will gain a victory,
over them and kill them very easily.’’* Therefore, the victory of
those, on whose banner Hanuman was sitting, was _ certain.

‘Pandavah'—Dhrtarastra, used the word ‘Pandavah' in his
question. Therefore, Safijaya also used the word 'Pandavah’, several
times (as in 1/14 and here in 1/20) to remind Dhrtarastra of
the Pandavas.

""HrsikeSamm tadaé vakyamidamaha mahipate'—Duryodhana,
seeing the army of Pandavas, approaching his preceptor Drona,
spoke the words cleverly; while Arjuna seeing the army of
Kauravas approaching Lord Krsna, who is a world-teacher, who
is acquainted with the hearts of all, and who is the inspirer of
mind and intellect etc., spoke the words full of bravery, courage,
and duty. :

senayorubhayormadhye ratham sthapaya me'cyuta

yavadetannirikse'ham yoddhukamanavasthitan

kairmaya saha yoddhavyamasminranasamudyame

Arjuna said: |

O Acyuta, (Acyuta means one who does not deviate from his
divine glory) place my chariot between the two armies and hold
it there, till I have carefully observed the war-minded warriors,
with whom, I must wage this war. 21-22
Comment:— |

'‘Acyuta senayorubhayormadhye ratharm sthapaya'—The two
armies were stationed at such a distance, from each other from
where they could shoot arrows etc., at each other. Arjuna asked
Lord Krsna to place the chariot in the middle. It was middle in
two ways (i) The middle of the breadth of the armies. (ii) The
middle of the two armies viz., equidistant from the two armies
should be the same. His purpose was to see the two armies, easily.

‘Senayorubhayormadhye’ has been used in the Gita three
times—here (in 1/21), in the twenty-fourth verse of this chapter
and in the tenth verse of the second chapter. He uses this phrase
three times, because the first time he asks Krsna to place the
chariot between the two armies (1/21), then Lord Krsna placing
the chariot between the two armies, tells Arjuna to behold the
Kauravas (1/24) and afterwards, preaches the gospel to despondent
Arjuna, right there (2/10). To begin with, Arjuna was valiant,
but when he saw his kith and kin in battle array, he developed
an attitude of disinterest being overtaken by attachment. Finally,
"
79,"36 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 1
Lord Krsna preached the gospel of the Gita, which dispelled his
attachment. It means, that a man in whatever circumstances he
is, by making proper use of circumstances, can be free from
desires and can realize God, because God (Paramatma), always
remains uniform in all circumstances.

""Yavadetannirikse'ham......ranasamudyame'—How long should
the chariot be placed between the two armies? Arjuna says, ""Hold
the chariot there, till I have carefully observed those war-minded

| kings with their armies, who are stationed in the army of Kauravas

| and with whom [ have to wage war. Let me see the heroes, I

| have to encounter. Let me, also see which of them are inferior,
superior and equal to:me, in heroism.""

Here, by the phrase ""Yoddhukaman,’ Arjuna means to say,
that they sent a proposal of conciliation, but the Kauravas did
not accept it, as they had a keen desire to wage war. So, he
wants to observe the warriors and their bravery, which makes
them so confident to wage war. :

and tried his best to humiliate them. Arjuna says, ""We are the

is evil-minded and these kings have assembled here to try to do
good to him. But the duty of a friend, is to give him such advice
as may add to his welfare now and hereafter. But, these kings
instead of removing his evil-mindedness, want to enhance it and
are really degrading him, by instigating him to wage war. They
are not thinking of his welfare here and hereafter. As friends, -
they should have advised him to rule over, half of the kingdom
and handover the other half, to us, the Pandavas. Thus, he would
have ruled: over half of the empire, and his life in the next world
would also have been protected."" |
""Yotsyamananavekse'ham ya ete'tra samagatah'— I want to
observe the warriors, who are so impatient to wage war. They
have favoured unrighteousness and injustice; so they are sure to
be ruined in the war, against us.
""Yotsyamanan'—it means that Arjuna wants to see those,
who have a keen desire to fight.

81,"38 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 1
Safijaya said: | . ,
""OQ Bharata"" (born in Bharata-family), thus addressed by
GudakeSa (one who has control over sleep viz., Arjuna), HrsikeSa
: (the Lord of the senses) placed the magnificent chariot between
the two armies, in front of Bhisma, Drona and all the kings, and
said, ""O Partha (the son of Prtha, Kunti), behold all these Kurus,
assembled here."" 24-25
Comment:— :
'GudakeSena'—'GudakeSa' has two meanings (1) ‘'Guda' means
‘curled’ and 'KeSsa' means ‘hair.’ It means one having curly hair
(ii) 'Gudaka' means 'sleep' and ‘Isa’ means ‘master.’ It means,
one who has conquered sleep. Arjuna had curly hair and he had
conquered sleep. So he has been called 'Gudakeéa’.
'Evamuktah'—One, who is not a slave to sleep, idleness and
worldly pleasures, but is a slave (devotee) to God; God listens
to such a person and even obeys him. Having said so, in order
to carry out the wish of his devotee-friend Arjuna, Lord Krsna,
placed the chariot between the two armies.
'Hrsikesah'—'Hrsika’ means 'senses' and 'Iéa' means ‘Lord.’
Thus 'Hrsikesa means the Lord of the senses. In the twenty-first
verse and also in this verse, this word has been used because
Lord Krsna, who is the inspirer of minds, intellects and senses
and who commands the whole world, has become a chariot-driver
to carry out Arjuna’s wish. It shows how kind He is to Arjuna.
'‘Senayorubhayormadhye sthapayitva rathottamam'—Lord
Krsna stationed Arjuna's noble chariot in the open space, between
the two armies.
'‘Bhismadronapramukhatah sarvesam ca mahiksitam'— Lord
Krsna placed the chariot with His sagacity, at such a point from
where his kinsmen such as. Bhisma, his preceptor Drona and
chief kings and warriors of Kaurava-army, could be clearly seen.
'Uvaca partha pasyaitan samavetankuriniti'—In the word
‘Kuru’, the sons of both Dhrtarastra and Pandu are included,
"
82,"Verse 24-25] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 39
because both of them belong to the Kuru family. Lord Krsna,
by saying ‘Behold all these Kurus assembled here’ means, that
by seeing them, Arjuna may think that they are all one, whether
they are on his side or on the opposite side and whether they
are good or bad and thus a feeling of kinship may develop in
him. This feeling of kinship may lead to attachment and make
him inquisitive. Thus, by making Arjuna an instrument, Lord
Krsna wants to preach the gospel of the Gita for the benediction
of the creatures of Kali-age. Therefore, Lord Krsna, instead of
using ‘Dhartarastran’, used the words 'Kurun'. If he had used
‘Dhartarastran’, Arjuna would have become enthusiastic and
. Lord Krsna, could not have got a chance to preach the gospel
of the Gita and Arjuna’s delusion, born of kinship, could not
have been destroyed. But, Lord Krsna, thought it His duty to
destroy Arjuna's delusion. As a surgeon, first gives medicine, to
a patient suffering from a boil so that it may suppurate and then
performs an operation, to remove the diseased part, in the same
way, God first arouses the hidden delusion of Arjuna and then
destroys it. Here, Lord Krsna by using the phrase ‘kurun pasya’
first arouses delusion in order to destroy it, by advice later.
Arjuna in the twenty-second and twenty-third verses of this
chapter wanted to behold and observe them. So Lord Krsna says,
“Behold these Kurus."" Lord Krsna could have placed the chariot
without uttering any words but he intentionally used the phrase
‘Kurtin pasya' to arouse attachment in Arjuna. |
There is a vast difference, between love for the family and
love for God though there is also a little similarity. When we
have love for members of our family, we overlook their faults,
because we have a feeling of mineness with them. Similarly,
God also does not heed the shortcomings of His devotee, because
He has the feeling that he is His own. But, in domestic love,
importance is attached to matters such as body etc., while in
love for God, there is importance of feelings. In family love,
"
83,"40 ~ SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter |
there is importance of delusion, while in love for God, there is
importance of alliance. In family-love, there is darkness, while
in divine love, there is light. In family-love, a man is negligent
of his duty, while in love for God, being engrossed in love, a
man may forget his duty momentarily, but is never negligent
of his duty. In family-love, there is pre-eminence of the family,
while in love for God, there is pre-eminence of God.

there and standing at their appointed places was filled with extreme
compassion and uttered these following words, in sadness. 27
Comment:— |

""Tan sarvanbandhiinavasthitan samiksya'—Besides the warriors
mentioned in the previous verse, Arjuna saw great grandfathers,
such as Bahlika etc., brothers-in-law, such as Dhrstadyumna,
Sikhandi and Suratha etc., sister's husbands, such as Jayadratha
etc., and several other relatives, who were posted in different
positions in both armies.

‘Sa kaunteyah krpaya parayavistah'—'Sa kaunteyah' means,
that Arjuna, who was ordered by mother Kunti to wage war and
who full of valour and  stout-heartedness, entered the battle-
field to observe the chief warriors of the Kaurava-army, was
overcome by cowardice.

After seeing the warriors, who were related to him, through
family and learning, on both the sides, Arjuna suddenly developed |
an attitude of kinship with them because he thought that on both
sides there were his kinsmen and they would be killed in the war.
In this way it was his family that would be destroyed ‘on either
"
85,"42 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 1

: side. Thinking thus his stout-heartedness gave place to cowardice
and he gave up the idea of war. This faint-heartedness, has been
called by Lord Krsna (in 2/2-3) 'KaSmalam’ viz., dejection and
‘Hrdayadaurbalyam’ viz., weakness of the heart. Arjuna (in 2/7)
also accepted it as ‘'Karpanyadosopahatasvabhavah' viz., nature
being tainted by the weakness of faint-heartedness. 'Krpayavistah'
means, that faint-heartedness is a temporary phase in him, while
stout-heartedness 1s a permanent virtue, of his life. Thus the
temporary phase of faint-heartedness cannot last too long, while
his stout-heartedness will remain, forever.

What is extreme cowardice? Extreme cowardice in Arjuna
is, that he does not think and make effort to kill his cruel and
unrighteous opponents, such as Duryodhana, Duhsasana and
Sakuni etc., who, without any reason, insulted the Pandavas gave
them trouble and tried to kill them, somehow or the other. On
the other hand, he is taking pity on them (Gita 1/35,46) and is
thus deviating from his duty, of the warrior-class.

'Visidannidamabravit'—Arjuna, is very much dejected after
thinking over the consequences of a war for the family, tribe
and country, and speaks the following words.

body shivers and hair stand on end. The bow, Gandiva slips from

* my hand, my skin burns all over. My mind is reeling as it were

and I am not able even, to stand. 28—30

Comment:—

'Drstvemam svajanarn krsna yuyutsurh samupasthitam'—
Arjuna loved the name Krsna, very much. So he has been
addressed by this name in the Gita nine time, more than any
other name. Lord Krsna, similarly loved Arjuna's name ‘Partha’
(the son of Prtha, Kunti). Therefore, while talking together,
both of them addressed each other by these names and this fact
was well-known to other people also. Therefore, Safijaya at the
end of the Gita in 18/78 mentions ‘Krsna’, and 'Partha—'Yatra
yogesvarah krsno yatra partho dhanurdharah (viz., wherever is
Krsna, the Lord of Yoga and wherever is Partha (Arjuna), the
wielder of the bow).

Dhrtarastra, in the first verse of this chapter, uses the phrase
‘Samaveta Yuyutsavah' (gathered together desirous to fight) and
Arjuna here has said, ""Yuyutsurn Samupasthitam’ (arrayed eager
to fight). But there is a vast difference, in the views of the two.
Dhrtarastra is partial to his sons. So, he uses the words 'Mamakah'
(Mine), and 'Pandavah' (Pandu's). But Arjuna is impartial. So he
uses the term 'Svajanam' (Kinsmen), which includes, persons of
both sides. It means, that Dhrtarastra is worried about the death.
of his’ sons in the warfare, while Arjuna is worried about the
death of warriors, in both armies, because he thinks that both
the warring groups, are his own kith and kin.

Till now the word 'Drstva' (having seen), has been used three
"
87,"44 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 1
times—'Drstva tu pandavanikam' (Having seen the army of the
Pandavas) (1/2), 'Vyavasthitan drstva dhartarastran' (Having seen
Dhrtarastra's party arrayed) (1/20), and here 'Drstvemarh svajanam’
(Having seen these kinsmen). It means, that there is no change
in the attitude of Duryodhana, as far as war is concerned. But,

7 there is a lot of change in Arjuna’s attitude. First, after seeing
the sons of Dhrtarastra, Arjuna like a hero, gets ready for war.
But after seeing his relatives present there, he is overwhelmed
with extreme compassion, his bow slips from his hand, and he
is not inclined to fight.

'Sidanti mama gatr4ni........bhramativa ca me manah'—Thinking
of the consequences of the war, Arjuna is worried and sad. So
his limbs are giving way, his mouth is getting parched, his body
shakes, and his hair is standing on an end. The same Gandiva
bow, the sound of whose string, terrified enemies, is dropping
from his hand and his skin is burning all over.* His mind tis
reeling, he is in a dilemma, and he is unable even to stand at
the war-front. He feels, as if he will fall unconscious, and thinks
it is a sin to wage war.

* Worry had been compared with pyre. There is a little difference between
the two. Worry burns a living man while pyre burns a dead man.
"
88,"Verse 32] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 45
Comment:—

'Nimittani ca pasyami viparitani keSava'—O KeSava, I find the
omens* inauspicious. Enthusiasm in the beginning of an activity,
leads it to success, while dilemma leads, to failure. So Arjuna
says that the omens—that his limbs are giving way, his body
is shaking, his mouth is getting parched—are not auspicious.T
Besides, these, other omens, such as the falling of a meteor,
untimely eclipse, earthquake, horrible sound of birds and animals,
obliteration of a black mark in the moon, falling of blood from
clouds, are inauspicious and all of these augur ill.

""Na ca Sreyo'nupasyami hatva svajanamahave'—I do not see
any good, in killing my kith and kin either in this world or
in the next, because only a sinner can destroy his kith and kin.
Therefore, sin, alone will accrue to us by killing them, and that
sin will lead us to hell.

In this verse, in both 'Nimittani paSyami' (I see omens) and
‘Sreyah anupasyami' (I see good) Arjuna wants to say that,
whether he goes by the omens or by this common sense, it 1s
certain that it 1s futile to wage war, and there is no good in it,
for them and for the entire world.

Comment:— | | |

[Lord Krsna in the twenty-first verse of the sixteenth chapter,
says that passion, anger and greed, these constitute the triple gates
to hell. Really these three, are different forms of passion. These
are born out of our attachment for worldly things and person.
Passion has two sides—to get the desired thing, and to get rid of
undesired one. Desired things include accumulation and enjoyment.
The desire for, accumulation is known as ‘greed’ and, desire for
enjoyments, is called 'passion.' If desire for accumulation and
enjoyment is not satisfied, anger accrues. In anger, men perform
actions, to destroy those who create obstacles, in the fulfilment
of their desires. It proves, that men fight to get desired things
and to get rid of undesired ones. But Arjuna, does not: want to
fight for either of the two.] : .

'‘Acaryah pitarah....kim nu mahikrte'—If our kith and kin,
being prompted by greed or anger want to slay me, I do not
seek to kill them, out of anger or greed, because these two are
the gateways to hell. , 7

Here the word 'Api' has been used, two times by Arjuna. It
means, first why should they kill me when I do not create any
obstacle to their selfish motive? Even then suppose, they slay
me, by thinking that I worked as an obstacle to their selfish
motive, I do not seek to slay them. Secondly, though there is
no possibility for the sovereignty of the three worlds coming to
me by killing them, yet, if I get it, I do not seek to slay them.

""Madhusiidana'*—It means that you killed the demons, such
as Madhu etc. But these teachers, such as Drona etc., and grand-
uncles, such as Bhisma etc., are not demons, they are our near
and dear ones. So, why should J have a desire to kill them?

* Lord Krsna is called Madhustdana because he killed the demon
named Madhu. 4 |
"

 ‘Acaryah'—I should serve respected and benevolent teachers,
such as Drona etc., rather than fight them. It is appropriate on
our part, even to sacrifice out lives at their feet. | |

or greed, when we have got this body linked with them?
'Putrah'—It is our duty to bring up our sons and our brother's
sons, even though they may stand against us or act badly.
'Pitamahah'—When our grand-uncles are worthy of adoration,
as our father, they deserve still greater adoration, from us. Though,
they may rebuke and punish us, yet we should not cause any
suffering to them, we should rather serve them and give comfort
to them. |
'Matulah'—Our maternal uncles, being the brothers of our

O Janardana, (Janardana, the name of Sri Krsna, means
a person who is worshipped by people for prosperity and
emancipation), what delight can we derive by slaying the
sons of Dhrtarastra? Sin alone will attach us by slaying these
desperadoes. 36
Comment:— |
""Nihatya dhartarastrannah ka pritih syajjanardana papameva-
Srayedasmanhatvaitanatatayinah—We cannot derive even the
slightest joy, by slaying the sons of Dhrtarastra.and the warriors
of their army. If we kill them, out of anger or greed, we shall
have to repent, because the memory of those kinsmen will obsess
us and the grief of their death, will torment us. We cannot get
| joy in this world, by killing them and sin will accrue, to us in
the next world, which will torment us there. |
There are six kinds of desperadoes—one who sets fire, who
poisons, who murders, who seizes wealth, who usurps kingdoms
and those who kidnap others’ wives.* . |
Duryodhana and his companions have committed all these
criminal offences. They secretly set fire to the residence, where
' Pandavas were expected to be sleeping, they poisoned Bhima
and threw him into water; they made an attempt on the life of
Pandavas; while gambling, deceitfully they deprived Pandavas
of their wealth and kingdom, and in the assembly, Duryodhana
insulted Draupadi, by calling her his waiting-maid and persuaded
Jayadratha to kidnap Draupadi, and he kidnapped her.
In the scriptures, it is mentioned that there is no sin in killing
a desperado (Manusmrti 8/351). But, it is also mentioned in the
scriptures, that non-violence is of great virtue. Therefore, why
should we slay our kith and kin, out of anger and greed?
Though Duryodhana etc., being desperadoes, deserve to be
killed, yet sin will accrue tous as a result of such action, because
they are our kith and kin. It is mentioned in the scriptures, that
* Vasistha smrti 3/19
"
94,"Verse 37] — SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 5]
one who kills his kith and kin, is a great sinner. So how can we
kill them? Therefore, it is better to break off our relationship with
them, rather than to kill them. In the same way, as relationship
could be cut off from a son, but he cannot be slain.

| Although these people, with their understanding (discrimination)
clouded by greed do not perceive the evil of destruction of their
own families and the sin accruing from enmity towards friends,
yet O Janardana (Krsna), why should we, who see clearly the sin
involved, in the destruction of the family, not think of turning
away from such a sin? 38-39 |
Comment:—

""Yadyapyete na paSyanti lobhopahatacetasah kulaksayakrtam
dosarn mitradrohe ca patakam'—Greed, consists in desiring to
have more and more of wealth, property, praise, respect and
rank. It is because of greed, that Duryodhana etc., lost discretion
and so they do not think about the disastrous consequences of
war and the sin, that will accrue out of it. :

This extraordinary greed, had deprived them of their sense
of discretion, and little do they realize, that the kingdom for
which they are bent upon committing the sin of destroying their
kith and kin, will not stay long, with them. The pleasure of
possession, is soon followed by the pain of deprivation, which
far outweighs the pleasure of possession: With minds clouded
by greed for the kingdom they do not perceive the deadly sin,
"
96,"Verse 38-39] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI - 53
which will arise by destroying their own families.

A battle causes loss of time, energy, life and property, and
people are assailed by worries and hardships. When there is a
quarrel between two friends, they turn into enemies. Drupada
and Drona had been friends since childhood. After getting the
kingdom one day Drupada insulted Drona, with the result, that
their friendship turned into enmity. To avenge his insult Drona
got Drupada defeated by his pupil, Arjuna, and thus got half of
his kingdom. Then Drupada, got a holy sacrifice performed to
destroy Drona, and thus both Dhrstadyumna and Draupadi, were
born. Thus, they do not perceive the evil of destruction of the
race, and the sin, that will accrue from enmity towards friends.

We managed life well, without things which we do not
possess. The paucity of things was not so painful as it is, if we
miss those things, after possessing them. But these things can be
with us for a short time, only, because these can stay with us so
long as our fortune favours us, and then they, slip away. Thus,
we remain the same as we were, without getting these. We had
to work hard to get them and are now sad, after losing them.
After getting them, we felt somewhat happy, only because of
our greed. If we do not have this evil of greed, we can never be
happy after getting the things. Similarly, we get happiness from
members of our family, because of love and delusion. Thus, we
see that we derive worldly pleasure out of evil. Without evil, no
worldly pleasure is possible. If there is no greed, there cannot
be any pleasure, in accumulation of wealth. Greed destroys our
discretion, and we cannot think in the right perspective.

""Katham na jiieyamasmabhih prapasyadbhirjanardana'—Arjuna
says—""Though Duryodhana etc., do not perceive any guilt in
the extermination of their family, and sin accruing from enmity
towards friends yet we should desist from such a sin. (It will
"
97,"54 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 1
be described from the 40th verse to the 44th verse), because
we know it very well, that destruction of family is an evil, and
enmity towards friends, is a sin. If those friends cause up pain,

| it will not be harmful for us, because pain will destroy our sins
and purify us. But, if we have feelings of malice and enmity,
those feelings remain with us, in other births also, will instigate
us to commit sins and lead us to, degradation. Therefore, we
should certainly forsake such a sin.

Here, Arjuna is thinking about the greed of Duryodhana
etc., but he is not thinking about his own, infatuation and
delusion. So he cannot understand his duty. It is a rule, that a

| man cannot perceive his failings as long he perceives defects,
in others. He feels rather proud of his superiority, that he has
no defect, while the fact is that, everyone generally, possesses
one defect or the other. If we find fault with others, it is also
a defect. Beings proud of one's own virtues and finding fault
with others are the two defects which we do not perceive in us,
though we do possess these. Thus Arjuna cannot perceive his
own infatuation and delusion, because he is finding fault with
Duryodhana, and is proud of his virtue (all evils persist under
the cover of pride). |

Comment:—

""Kulaksaye pranaSyanti kuladharmah sanatanah'—In a war,
there is destruction of family. The family has its agelong traditions
and time-honoured usage. But when a family is destroyed, its
pious traditions and usage, which lead the living and dead
members of the family to benediction, also perish, because no
one remains, to maintain these. .

""Dharme naste kular krtsnamadharmo'bhibhavatyuta'—When
pious traditions and pious conduct, perish, people lose their virtues
and righteousness, and impiety takes hold of an entire family.

Now the doubt arises, how impiety takes hold of the family

| when it is destroyed. The answer is, that when people who wage
war are killed, impiety takes hold of the children and women,
who do not take part in battle, but are left behind. The reason
is that when fit and experienced persons die in battle, no one
is left behind to control the children and women, and to teach
them good conduct and virtuous behaviour. So they do not
behave decently that is supposed to mark, righteous persons. So
impiety takes hold of them.

and placid (sattviki). Intellect has discrimination between right
and wrong. But, when there is growth of impiety, in family, the
conduct of members in the family, becomes bad. Bad conduct
fouls the inner sense whose inner sense, makes the intellect
'tamasi' (the intellect which veils knowledge and binds one to
carelessness is called ‘tamasi'). With this ""Tamasi' intellect, men
lose discrimination, regard the undesirable as desirable, and the
desirable as undesirable and act against ordinance of scriptures.
With such an intellect women become depraved viz., unchaste.

: 'Strisu dustasu varsneya jayate varnasankarah'—Depraved
women give birth to hybrids.* If man and woman belong to
different castes, the offspring born of the couple, is known as
a hybrid, (mixture). |

Here, Arjuna by addressing the Lord as ‘Krsna’, means to
say that He attracts everyone. He further asks him, in which
direction, He will pull his family.

Arjuna addresses him as Varsneya, because He belonged to
the Vrsni clan. He means to say, to what clan will his descendants
belong, when destruction of his clan, takes place? Therefore, it
is not proper to destroy the clan. |

Comment:— a : ,

‘Sankaro narakayaiva kulaghnanam kulasya ca'—The
offsprings, that are born of an intermixture of castes, are not
religious-minded and do not possess righteousness and rectitude,
because they themselves are the product of persons, without
virtue. So they behave against traditions and decorum of a race.
Those who kill persons of a race war are called destroyers of the
race. Such persons, lead not only themselves but also the whole
race, to hell, because of destruction of traditions, of the race.

'Patanti pitaro hyesam luptapindodakakriyah'—The manes of
the destroyers of a race, fall because they do not get the ritual
offerings of rice-balls (Pinda) and water from them. The reason
is, that when they get these offerings, because of those virtuous
actions, they go to higher worlds. But, when they do not get
those offerings, they cannot continue to live in those worlds and
they are degraded.

A descendant, who is a hybrid has no regard for his ancestors,
and he has no sentiment to offer anything, to them. Moreover,
even if he offers anything, such as obsequies, as a social custom,
without any regard and against the ordinance of scriptures, that is
not received by the manes. The reason is, that he is not eligible
to perform such rites. So they have a fall.

Appendix—There are two types of manes—‘ajana’ and
‘martya’. The manes who live in the world of manes are ‘ajana’,
while the manes who go to the world of manes after dying
from the human-world are ‘martya’. The ‘martya’ manes being
deprived of the ritual offerings of rice-balls and water, have a
downfall. Only those ‘martya’ manes have a downfall who have
affinity for the family and offspring and expect to receive the
ritual offerings of rice-balls and water.

of knowledgé), ‘yogasastra’ (the discipline of action) and
| ‘Stikrsnarjuna sarnvada’ (the discipline of devotion)—the three
have been included. | :
“Jn the Gita ‘Srikrsnarjuna sarhvada’ viz., the dialogue between
Lord Krsna and Arjuna begins with devotion and ends in devotion.
In the beginning Arjuna, being confused with regard to his duty,
takes refuge in God——‘Sisyaste’ harh Sadhi marh tvarh prapannam’
(Gita 2/7) and in the end being inspired by the Lord for taking
refuge in Him alone, by the expression ‘mamekarh Saranarh vraja’,
Arjuna takes refuge in Him alone, when he declares—‘karisye
vacanam tava’ (I will do your bidding). Arjuna asked Lord Krsna
| the means by which he might attain the highest good (Gita 2/7,
3/2, 5/1). Therefore the Lord has also described ‘“Jnanayoga’
(the discipline of knowledge) and ‘Karmayoga’ (the discipline
of action) in the Gita. :

Comment:— | |

""Aho bata mahatpapam kartum vyavasita vayam yadrajya-
sukhalobhena hanturh svajanamudyatah'—Duryodhana and his
companions, are villains. Being goaded by greed, they are not
guided by righteousness and so they are prepared to wage a
war. We have the power to discriminate between righteousness
and unrighteousness, virtue and vice, but we are also prepared

| to wage war to kill our own kinsmen, just like ignorant people.
So it is something very surprising and shocking. By doing so,
we are going to commit a great sin, by turning a deaf ear to the

: teachings of preceptors and scriptures.

The word 'Aho' expresses surprise. It is surprising, that we
have decided to commit sin by waging this war, even having
known its horrifying consequences. The word ‘Bata’, expresses
sorrow. It is a matter of sorrow, that we are prepared to slay
our kith and kin, being over powered by greed, for a transient
kingdom and pleasure.

_. Greed for kingdom and pleasure, is the only cause, for
"
104,"Verse 45] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 61
perpetrating the great sin of killing our kinsmen. It means, that
if we get victory in the battle, we shall get kingdom, wealth,
honour, glory, power, pleasure and luxuries. Such greed for
kingdom and enjoyment, is totally unjustified for such people
as us. |

In this verse, Arjuna wants to say that a man can carry out
the behest of scriptures and teachers etc., only by honouring his
own good ideas, and his own knowledge. But he who dishonours
them, cannot adopt virtuous principles of scriptures and teachers.
Thus good thoughts and ideas do not arise up in him. Then, who
can check him from possessing evil thoughts and performing evil
actions? Similarly, if we disregard our knowledge, who can check
us from committing the great sin of killing our kinsmen?

Here, Arjuna is thinking about the disastrous consequences
cf war and so he is not willing to wage it. But he is not thinking
that his feelings of attachment, selfishness and delusion for the
family, are responsible for his behaviour which is totally wrong
for a thoughtful, righteous and brave member, of the warrior-
class.

[Arjuna in the thirty-eighth verse states that Duryodhana
etc., with mind blinded by greed do not perceive the evil of
destruction of their own clan and the sin accruing from enmity
towards friends. Here, he says that goaded by the greed for
throne and enjoyment, they themselves are prepared to commit
a great sin. It proves that Arjuna knows that greed is the cause
of sins. But, in the thirty-sixth verse of the third chapter, he
asks, ""Impelled by what does a man commit sin, unwillingly?
And why?"" The answer is, that he has a feeling of attachment

_and affection for the family, so he wants to turn away from war.
He thinks, that greed is the root cause of the sin of destruction
of one's own clan. But, by hearing the gospel of the Gita, he
"
105,"62 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 1

wants to know the path or discipline by pursuing which, he may
: obtain the highest good—the supreme bliss (Gita 3/2). So, in the

third chapter he asks, which is the force that impels a man to

abandon his duty viz., (in 3/36) Arjuna, asks the question as a

striver, about his duty, not as a person, having attachment for

his family.]

It would, indeed, be better for me, if the sons of Dhrtarastra

unarmed and unresisting. 46
Comment:—

""Yadi mamapratikaramasastram Sastrapanayah dhartarastra
rane hanyustanme ksemataram bhavet'—Arjuna says, ""If I turn
away from the war, perhaps our opponents will also desist from
it. Why will they fight, if we are determined not to fight? But
even if, regarding us as their enemy, they zealously, armed with
weapons kill me, that will indeed be in my own interest, as it
will be a kind of repentance for the determination, which I had
made, in the war to kill my preceptors, and I shall be purified
of the sins. It means that if I do not wage war, I will escape
sin and my. race, will not be destroyed.""

[When a man talks about a subject, it has its effect, on him
also. When Arjuna, possessed by extreme passion, started to
"
106,"Verse 46] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 63
speak in sadness, in the twenty-eighth verse, he was not so much
overwhelmed with grief as he was now. Then, Arjuna did not turn
away from war, but went on speaking, overwhelmed with grief.
But at last, he turns away from war, and sits down having laid
down his bow and arrow. Lord Krsna did not speak, to enable
Arjuna to give an outlet for his feelings of sadness completely,
because he knew, that his teachings would be of some avail to
him, only when there was an outlet for his sorrow.]
oe

Worldly people will support the arguments adduced by
Arjuna, but they will not agree with Lord Krsna, who will justify
war later. The reason is, that as Arjuna is full of attachment
and love, the worldly people also belong to the same class. So
they cannot understand the point of view, expressed by Lord
Krsna, who always thinks about the welfare and benediction of
beings. They will say that Arjuna wanted to escape the sin, by
not waging war, but it was Lord Krsna, who inspired him to
wage war. So, it was not proper on His part, to do so.

The fact is, that Lord Krsna did not make Arjuna wage
war. He reminded him of his duty only. It was Arjuna, who had
invited Lord Krsna, to the war front. But seeing his kinsmen on
the hostile side, he was turning away from his duty. So Lord
Krsna reminded him not to neglect his duty, out of delusion
but to wage war, because there was nothing more welcome to
a member of the warrior-class than a righteous war.

For example; if a man is going to Badrinarayana, but by
mistake he starts going in the opposite direction. He then happens
to meet a person, who asks him where he was going. The latter,
tells him that he has taken the wrong direction, so he should turn
back, in order to reach his destination. Here, the person shows
"
107,"64 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 1
the right direction (way), to the man who had lost it. Similarly,
Lord Krsna showed Arjuna the right direction, of his duty.
After seeing his kinsmen arrayed, on the war front, Arjuna
said to Lord Krsna, ""I will not fight"" (2/9). But after hearing
the gospel of Lord Krsna he did not say ""I'll not fight"" but he
said, ""I will carry out your bidding"" (18/73) viz., ""I will do my
duty."" It shows, that Lord Krsna reminded him of his duty.
The fact is, that war was inevitable because Lord Krsna
Himself, while revealing his supreme divine form to Arjuna,
said, ""I am the mighty world-destroying time, the destroyer of
the world. My purpose here is to destroy these people. Even if
you do not kill them, all those warriors arrayed in the enemy's
camp, will not survive"" (11/32). Thus this destruction of human
beings was inevitable, even if Arjuna did not fight. If Arjuna
did not fight, Yudhisthira, who with his four brothers married
Draupadi by obeying his mother, would certainly fight by obeying
her. Similarly, Bhima would never deviate from the war because
he had already taken a pledge to kill the Kauravas. As far as
Draupadi is concerned, she had even said, that if her husbands,
the Pandavas did not fight, her father (Drupada), her brother
(Dhrstadyumna), her five sons and Abhimanyu, would fight against
the Kauravas*. All these facts, show that the war was inevitable.
A man cannot control the happenings that are pre-destined.
By discharging his duty one can attain salvation, but by neglecting
it, he can degrade himself. It means that man is free to attain,
either desirable or undesirable results. Therefore, Lord Krsna, by
reminding Arjuna of his duty, has preached to human beings,
that they should always discharge their duty, by following the
ordinance of scriptures and never turn away from these.

Arjuna, grief stricken on the battlefield, having spoken thus,
and having laid down his bow and arrow, slumped into the central
part of the chariot. 47 |
Comment:—

‘Evamuktvarjunah sankhye rathopastha upavisat visrjya
saSaram capam Sokasamvignamanasah'—War, is the root cause
of all evils. It will destroy a race and will lead us to hell in the
next world. By thinking so Arjuna, overwhelmed with sorrow,
became firmly determined not to wage war. Arjuna, who had
come to the battlefield with great zeal with Gandiva bow in
his hand, put the bow and arrow down, and overwhelmed with
sorrow, sat on the seat of the chariot. | .

The main reason of Arjuna's grief, is that when Lord Krsna
placed the chariot between the two armies and asked Arjuna,
to behold the Kauravas, he saw Bhisma and Drona standing in
front of him. So his attachment was aroused. Thus, he thought
about the destruction of his race (which Duryodhana etc., did
not perceive being goaded by greed) and the sin, accruing from
it. Then he said that, even if the warriors of the hostile army
killed him, while he was unarmed and unresisting, that would
be for his good. Thus empowered by delusion, Arjuna perceives
"
109,"66 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter I
good in turning away from war, and even in his death and finally
having abandoned his bow and arrow and overwhelmed with
grief, sits on the middle seat of the chariot. Thus, we see that
it is delusion, which changes a hero's (Arjuna’s), great courage
to consternation.

Thus with the words, Om, Tat, Sat—the names of the Lord
as sung in the Upanisad of the Bhagavadgita by the Lord, the
science of Brahma, the scripture on Yoga, the dialogue between
Sri Krsna and Arjuna, ends the first chapter entitled, 'The Yoga
of Dejection of Arjuna’.

The colophon at the end of each chapter, written by sage
Veda Vyasa reveals the glory and greatness of the Gita. ‘Om,
Tat, Sat'*—this has been declared as the triple designation of
the Absolute. These three names, lead the beings to benediction
and turn us towards God and spirituality and break off our
relationship with the world. These wash away the mistakes, which
we might have committed in pronouncing the verses, words and
letters, in the chapter. So these three are pronounced at the end
of each chapter.

By 'Om' sage Veda Vyasa means, that this may wash away
the mistakes of the verses, ""Tat' may turn his verses towards God,
and 'Sat' means, that these verses may give an imperishable fruit.
'Iti', means that he has no other personal motive besides this one.

The Gita has been called 'Srimad’ because it possesses
paramount beauty, and it is called 'Stimadbhagavad', because

* Vide—Gita 17/23—27
"
110,"SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 67
it has been uttered by Lord Krsna, who possesses six: 'Bhagas'’
i.e., divine traits—wealth, virtue, glory, greatness, knowledge
and dispassion. .

It has been called the Gita, because it has been sung by the
Lord Himself. According to the rules of Sarnskrta grammar,
it should have been called 'Gitam', yet it being the essence of
Upanisads, in feminine gender, it has been called the ‘Gita.’

The essence of all Upanisads, is contained in it and it
has emanated from the tongue of the Lord Himself, so it is
called ‘Upanisad.’ |

It is called 'Brahmavidya (Supreme Knowledge), because it
leads the living being, to benediction without any distinction of
caste, creed and colour. It is called 'YogaSastra’ because different
Yogas (Disciplines), such as Karmayoga (the Discipline of
Disinterested Action), Jnanayoga (the Discipline of Knowledge),
Dhyanayoga (the Discipline of Meditation) and Bhaktiyoga
(the Discipline of Devotion), are contained in it. By following
anyone of these disciplines a striver, can realize his identity with
God (Paramatma).

It is a dialogue, between Lord Krsna and the devotee Arjuna.
Arjuna has asked questions without hesitation, and Lord Krsna
has answered them with generosity. So it is called a dialogue
between Sri Krsna and Arjuna. |

In the first chapter, there is description of Arjuna's dejection.
By the company of God and saints, this dejection may create
dispassion and thus may lead to benediction. Though Duryodhana,
also possessed dejection, yet having disinclination for God, his
dejection is not called ‘Yoga’. But it is called Yoga, in the case
of Arjuna as he could realize his identity with God, by means
of this 'Yoga.' So this chapter is entitled ""The Yoga of Dejection
of Arjuna.’
"

_| Second Chapter
INTRODUCTION

Duryodhana mentioned the great warriors of the two armies,
but Dronacarya did not utter a word. So Duryodhana became
sad. Then, Bhisma blew: his conch loudly to cheer Duryodhana.
Hearing the sound of his conch, the conchs, drums and cow-
horns etc., of the Kaurava and the Pandava armies blared forth.
After this (from the twentieth verse) the dialogue between Lord
Krsna and Arjuna began.

Arjuna asked Lord Krsna, to place his chariot in the midst
of the two armies. The Lord, having placed the chariot between
the two armies, in front of Bhisma and Drona etc., asked Arjuna
to behold the Kurus. Having seen his kinsmen, he was filled
with compassion and sadness, that he cast away his bow and
arrows, and slumped into the seat of the chariot.

The second chapter starts with Safijaya telling Dhrtarastra,
what Lord Krsna had said to Arjuna, when he was overwhelmed
with grief.

addressed the following words to Arjuna, who was overwhelmed

with tears of despondence. 1
"
113,"70 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
Comment:— |

‘Tam tatha krpayavistam'—Arjuna advises Lord Krsna to
place his chariot in between the two armies, so that he may
behold the war-minded warriors who dared to risk their lives,
by fighting against such a valiant warrior, as he. But the same
heroic and zealous Arjuna, at the sight of his kinsmen, becomes
overwhelmed with grief, his limbs give way, his mouth is parched,
his body shivers, his hairs stand on end, his bow slips, from his
hand, his skin burns all over and his mind reels. His bravery
turns into faint-heartedness and he slips into the seat of the
chariot. Safijaya, conveys the same feelings of Arjuna, who was
drowned in distress and despondency. © os

‘ASrupirnakuleksanam'—Such a valiant warrior, Arjuna was
full of familial attachment and his eyes were full of tears, that
he could not even see, clearly.

'Visidantamidam vakyamuvaca madhusiidanah'—Lord Krsna
(Madhusudana), said the following words (the words which will
be repeated in the second and third verses) to Arjuna, who was
overwhelmed with grief because of his loss of courage.

Here, ""Visidantamuvaca’ was enough, because the word
""Vakyam’' is also included in the verb ‘'Uvaca’. But the word
""Vakyam' has a special meaning. These words of Lord Krsna,
are very profound and uncommon. These attack Arjuna’'s faint-
heartedness and despondency, which overpowered Arjuna, in the
discharge of his duty. They make him aware of his weakness
and arouse in him a desire for benediction. It is because of these
profound words of Lord Krsna, that Arjuna by becoming His
disciple and seeks refuge in Him (2 /7).

Sanjaya by using the word 'Madhustdana’, means to say
that Lord Krsna is the killer of demon, Madhu 1.e., He is the
destroyer of people having a villainous nature, and so He will
certainly destroy wicked natured Duryodhana, and his group.

Arjuna, how has this affliction overtaken you at this odd
hour? It is shunned by noble souls; neither could it bring heaven
nor fame to you. 2
Comment:— |

(‘Arjuna—Lord Krsna, addresses him as ‘Arjuna’ which means,
pure in heart. The Lord means to say, how he has become faint-
hearted, when it is quite unbecoming of him.]

'Kutastva| kaSmalamidam visame samupasthitam'—Lord
Krsna, being surprised asks Arjuna, why he has developed
faint-heartedness, instead of valour and zeal, at this juncture. A
man is surprised in two ways—out of his own ignorance, and
as a warning to others. Lord Krsna's surprise here is, a warning
to Arjuna, so that he may be aware of his duty.

‘Kutah' means that this faint-heartedness is not permanent in
him, it is only a temporary phase, which will go away.

‘Samupasthitam’ means, you are faint-hearted, not only in
words and feelings, but also in actions, you are overcome by
this faint-heartedness and therefore you sat in the middle of the
chariot, after abandoning your bow and arrows.

* The Lord is called ""Bhagavan' because he possesses six ‘Bhagas’ (divine
traits). They are wealth, virtue, glory, greatness, knowledge and dispassion.
"
115,"72 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter2

'Anaryajustam'— Great people do not become faint-hearted,
they shun the feeling because, it does not lead them, to any good.

Great men who want to achieve success do so with fixed
objectives, during activity as well as non-activity. They do not
shirk their duty. According to prevailing circumstances, they
perform their duty thoroughly, with zeal and readiness, in order
to achieve emancipation. So, it is not proper on his part to refrain
from the duty of fighting, because of cowardice.

‘Asvargyam'—If we leave aside the goal of success and
consider the matter from a worldly point of view, the attainment
of heaven, is the highest achievement. With this timidity you

| cannot even attain the heaven.

'‘Akirtikaram'—Even without having the aim of attainment
of heaven, a noble person performs those deeds which bring him
name and fame in the world. But this cowardice would defame
you. So it does not befit you at all, to be faint-hearted.

Here, the Lord by giving these three expressions 'Anaryajustam’,

| ‘Asvargyam’ and 'Akirtikaram’, in a sequence has explained that
there are three types of persons (i) Thoughtful—whose aim is to
attain benediction, (ii) Virtuous—who by doing virtuous actions
want to attain heaven, (iii) and Ordinary—-who want name and
fame in the world. So, by giving the above-mentioned three
kind, Lord Krsna wants to warn Arjuna that, his affliction would
bring him neither benediction, nor heaven nor fame, but would
degrade and defame him, and lead him to hell.

Comment:—

‘Partha'*—Lord Krsna addresses Arjuna as 'Partha’,, to remind
him of Mother Kunti's messagef and arouse in him feelings of
bravery which befits the members of a warrior-class. It means,
that he should not disobey his mother by showing cowardice.

'Klaibyarn ma sma gamah'—It is because of faint-heartedness
that Arjuna perceives it, righteous not to wage war and unrighteous
to wage war. Therefore to warn him, Lord Krsna says that it
is impotence rather than righteousness, not to wage war. So he
should abandon this weakness.

'Naitattvayyupapadyate'— You should not have developed this __
timidity in you, because you are, the son of a brave mother of
warrior-class, and you yourself are also brave. Therefore, this
weakness does not befit you at all. |

'‘Parantapa'—You are the scorcher and vanquisher of foes.
So, will you gladden your enemies by showing your disinclination
for war?

'Ksudram hrdayadaurbalyam tyaktvottistha'—Here, 'Ksudram’,
has two meanings—(1) This faint-heartedness will make you lowly
viz., it will deprive you of salvation, heaven or fame and if you

* Being the son of Prtha Arjuna is called ‘Partha’. This word manifests
intimacy between Lord Krsna and Arjuna. In the Gita Lord Krsna has used this
address thirty-eight times, more than any other address. The second place goes
to 'Kaunteya' which has been used twenty-four times.

When Lord Krsna wants to say something special or give assurance to Arjuna
or there is an overflow of love for him, He calls him ‘Partha.’ By addressing him
thus, he wants to remind him that besides being the son of his father's sister, he is
his loving devotee and friend (Gita 4/3). Therefore He tells him something very
secret and true for his welfare. ,

+ Kunti's message to Arjuna and to Bhima who were ever eager to fight—

It is the time for which the mother of the warrior-class gives birth to her sons.
"
117,"74 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
do not abandon it, you will become insignificant. (ii) This faint-
heartedness, is petty. So it is not difficult for a brave person
like you to abandon.

You are thinking that being virtuous, you do not want to
commit a sin by waging war, but it is your cowardice. So by
abandoning it, you should discharge your duty, by arraying
yourself to wage war.

Lord Krsna knows for certain, that it is Arjuna’s first
and foremost duty to wage war. So, He, without caring for
Arjuna's lame excuses, orders him quickly to wage war, with
full preparations.

Appendix—This fact has been described in detail by the
Lord ahead from the thirty-first verse to the thirty-eighth verse
of this chapters.

against the war. But without attaching importance to his
arguments, Lord Krsna suddenly scolded Arjuna for his faint-

such as Madhu etc., and foes also who always are jealous of
others, without rhyme or reason. But how can he kill his great
well-wisher, the respected grandfather Bhisma, and adorable
preceptor Drona, who have great affection for him?]

'Katham bhismamaham sankhye dronam ca'—I am not turning
away from war because of faint-heartedness, but because it is
unrighteous for me to fight, with the revered grandsire Bhisma
and venerable teacher Drona. I would be called unmanly if [
were afraid of death. IJ am not afraid of dying but I do not
want to kill my venerable elders, who have always been very
affectionate to me.

Grandfather Bhisma, has loved me since my childhood.
When I addressed him as father, he very affectionately used
to say, that he was my father's father. Similarly, my adorable
preceptor Drona, has been so kind to me that he imparted to
me better training, than he imparted even to his son. He taught
the use of Brahma-weapon, (a kind of weapon which caused
infallible destruction and set in motion by incantation) to both
of us, but as far as its control or end is concerned, he taught
that only to me, not to his son. He also granted me a boon that
no one would excel me, in military science. So it is a mortal
sin, to wage war against them. |

Better to live on alms in this world, than to slay these noble
elders, because after killing them we could enjoy only blood-stained
pleasure, in the form of wealth and sense-objects. 5
Comment:—

[It seems after reading this verse, that the words of Lord
Krsna, uttered in the second and third verses, had some effect on
Arjuna. He is thinking, that though Lord Krsna knows that it is
not justified for him to kill his venerable elders, yet he is unable
to understand why He is ordering him to wage war. So Arjuna,
does not speak with excitement, but speaks, somewhat, politely.]

~ 'Guriinahatva hi mahanubhavan Sreyo bhoktum bhaiksyamapiha
loke'—Arjuna, first presents his point of view, saying that if he
did not fight with reverend Bhisma and Drona etc., Duryodhana
by himself, would not fight with him either. Thus he would lose
his kingdom and suffer. Then he would be leading a life of
misery and could even depend on alms. But he thinks it better
to live on alms, than to slay his reverend elders.

'Tha loke' means—if I live on alms, people in the world will
dishonour, reproach and insult me, but I think accepting alms is
better than killing my reverend preceptors. |

‘Api’ (Even) means—for me slaying the noble preceptors and
"
120,"Verse 5] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 77
living on alms—both are forbidden. But, I think it is more sinful
to kill the preceptors, than to live on alms.

'Hatvarthakamamstu  gurinihaiva bhufijiya bhogan
rudhirapradigdhan'—-If I carry out your command to wage war,
I would enjoy blood-stained pleasure, which will not give me
peace and salvation. : |

Here, a question might arise, that Bhisma and Drona etc.,
preceptors were attached to Kauravas, because of pecuniary
motives. Therefore, what is the objection if ‘Arthakaméan' 1s
taken as an adjective qualifying 'Gurin’. The answer is, that
it is not proper, because they had no desire for money. It was |
incumbent upon them to fight on Duryodhana’'s side, because
they had eaten his salt.

Secondly, Arjuna has used the term 'Mahanubhavan (most
noble). So, how can the most noble souls desire money? Those
who desire money could not be most noble. Therefore, here
‘Arthakaman’, is the adjective which qualifies ‘Bhogan’.

Lord Krsna, in the second and the third verses, orders Arjuna
to array himself by casting off, petty faint-heartedness and fight.
But Arjuna gets him wrong, because he thinks that Lord Krsna
had ordered him to wage war, so that he might enjoy the pleasure
of kingship.* Arjuna however perceived only evil, in waging the
war. He said that it would be better for him, if his opponents
killed him in the war. So with his mind affected by grief he sat
slumped on the seat of the chariot (1/47). He had also said, that
Duryodhana and his companions being goaded by greed, were
prepared to wage war. Now Arjuna says, for himself that if he

* The worldly people having a materialistic outlook cannot even think of
spiritualism. Here Arjuna also being overtaken by family attachment and infatuation
is thinking only of materialism rather than spiritualism. So he is thinking that Lord
Krsna wants him to wage the war so that he may obtain kingdom but Lord Krsna
wants him to attain salvation.
"
121,"78 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
carries out his order and wages war, he will enjoy only blood-
stained pleasure in the form of wealth and sensual enjoyment.
Thus, he perceives nothing but evil, in waging war.

When an evil comes to us, in the form of an evil, it is
easier to do away with it, than when it comes in the garb of
something good. Ravana and devil Kalanemi, could not be
recognized by Sita, and Hanuman respectively, because both of
them disguised themselves, as sages. Similarly, Arjuna perceives

' that it is virtuous not to wage war and it is an evil to wage the
war, but he is completely mistaken. Hence, even Lord Krsna,
finds it difficult and time consuming, to bring Arjuna round, to
the realization of this fact. | |

Today in the name of unity in society, people are determined
to abolish caste, stage of life system (Varna Aérama) thinking
of their action, as virtuous. But they are not thinking about the
disastrous consequences, that this abolition would force the people,
to lead a degraded and demoniacal life. In the same way, in
the accumulation of wealth, people do not perceive falsehood,
fraud, dishonesty, knavery. and treachery etc., as evils. Thus,
here for Arjuna also, an evil of unmanliness has disguised itself,
as righteousness and thus he says how he can slay his noble —

elders. It means, that whatever Arjuna considers a virtue, is in

fact, an evil. But, it does not appear to him, to be an evil, as in

the abandonment of his duty, has crept in the guise of virtue of
nonviolence, because of his attachment for his relatives.

Appendix—The feelings of elders and preceptors such as
Bhisma and Drona etc., are noble and pure because even while
waging the war, they have no partiality.

POSES IY

Link:—The holy words of God had a singular effect and
exerted a deep and far reaching influence, on Arjuna, as a result
of which, he starts doubting the correctness of his decision, not
to wage war. In such a state of mind, Arjuna says.

Comment:—

'Na caitadvidmah kataranno gariyah'— I cannot decide
whether | should wage war or not, because you consider it better
to wage war but I do not do so, as it is a sin to kill noble elders
and preceptors.

""Yadva jayema yadi va no jayeyuh'—If I carry out your order
and wage war, we do not know, whether we shall win or lose.

Here, it does not mean that Arjuna has no confidence in his
own power, but he is uncertain about the future, because no one
knows, what may happen in future.

""Yaneva hatva na jijivisimah'—Not to speak of pleasures and
kingdom, we do not even wish to live by killing our kinsmen
because by killing them we shall be bereaved of them and thus
shall suffer pangs of bereavement.

'Te'vasthitah pramukhe dhartarastrah'—Dhrtarastra's sons, are
our kinsmen and they are arrayed against us. So, how can we kill
them? We are damned, if we wish to live, by killing them.

My nature is overwhelmed with the vice of faint-heartedness
and my mind is confused with regard to my duty. I entreat you, tell
me what is decidedly good for me. I am your disciple. Do instruct
me, who have taken refuge, in you. 7
Comment:—

""Karpanyadosopahatasvabhavah prcchami tvam dharma-
sammiidhacetah'—Arjuna did not think it desirable to turn away
totally, from the war, but to escape the sin, he did not find any
other alternative. So he wanted to turn away from war and he
thought of such action, as a virtue, rather than a vice of faint-
heartedness. But, when Lord Krsna called his action faint-hearted
and unmanly, Arjuna was reminded of his duty, as a member of
the warrior-class for whom it was not befitting to run. So Arjuna
by conceding his faint-heartedness, says that first his nature even
as a member of the warrior-class, was weighed down with the
weakness of faint-heartedness and secondly, his mind was confused
with regard to his duty. Being overpowered by delusion, he could
not take the right decision, about its righteousness.

In the third verse Lord Krsna advised Arjuna, ""Cast off
your petty faint-heartedness and stand up, for war."" So his
doubt should have been removed. But he still had some doubt,
because, on the one hand he thought that it was a sin to kill the
"
124,"Verse 7] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 81
kinsmen and the adorable elders, but on the other hand, being
a member of the warrior-class it was his duty to wage war. So
he was confused with regard to his duty, and he entreats Lord
Krsna to tell him, what his real duty is. | :

'Yacchreyah syanniscitam brithi tanme'—In the second verse
of this chapter, Lord Krsna told him that his dejection was
a shame and it should be shunned by noble souls. So Arjuna
thought, that he should also follow the path, adopted by noble
souls. Therefore, he prays to Lord Krsna, to tell him what is
decidedly good for him.

First Arjuna was agitated and distressed, and he asks what
was good for him. It shows that, an awakening for salvation as
a goal is not aroused in a man, so long as he is satisfied with
his present situation. But when he is dissatisfied and he wants to |
rise above it, he becomes aware of his real aim 1.e., salvation.

'Sisyaste'ham'—When Arjuna entreated Lord Krsna, to tell
him what was decidedly good for him, he thought that such a
question could be put to a teacher, not to a chariot-driver. Arjuna's
conviction, that he was a chriot-warrior, while Krsna was his
charioteer, whom he ordered to place the chariot between the two
armies, had gone. So he becomes His disciple and declares, ""I
am your disciple, so tell me what is decidely, good for me.""

'‘Sddhi mam tvam prapannam'—Arjuna thinks, that the
preceptor can guide the disciple and a disciple will have to
shoulder the responsibility to translate his teachings into practice,
and then make effort to attain salvation. But he wants to hand
over this responsibility, to his preceptor. As the mother of a
breast-sucking child, not the child who falls sick, takes medicine
for his recovery, the teacher take over responsibility of the

_ disciple, who takes refuge in him. So Arjuna, by depending on
the teacher and surrendering to Him says, ""I have taken refuge
in You, instruct me."" | | :

Here, Arjuna by using the phrase ""Tvam prapannam' says,
"
125,"82 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
that he has taken refuge in Him. But actually he had -not taken
completely refuge in Him. Had he done this, he would not
have uttered the words ‘Instruct me’, because a disciple has
no responsibility of his own, the full responsibility lies with
the teacher. Secondly, in the ninth verse he says, ""I shall not
fight.” It also shows that he had not really iaken refuge in Him,

| otherwise he might have not uttered these words. A disciple,
who takes refuge in his teacher has no say, no responsibility
of his own, he becomes merely an instrument, in the hands of
his preceptor and does whatever his teacher wants him, to do.
Therefore, Lord Krsna in the sixty-sixth verse of the eighteenth
chapter says, ""Seek refuge in Me, alone"" (18/66). Then Arjuna,
in the seventy-third verse of the eighteenth chapter says, ""I shall
act according to Your word."" It is here, that Arjuna really takes
refuge, in Him.

In this verse, there are four points spoken by Arjuna, which
need attention—

(i) My nature is weighed down, with the vice of faint-
heartedness and I entreat you because my mind is confused with
regard to my duty. (ii) Tell me he entreats, what is decidedly
good for me. (it) I am Your disciple. (iv) Instruct me who has
taken refuge in You. If we think over these four points, one
by one, we realise that as far as the first point is concerned,
the person to whom the question is asked, is free, whether he
answers the question or not. The second point, shows that it 1s
his duty to answer. In the third, the responsibility to guide the
disciple, so that he may attain salvation is that of the teacher.
In the fourth, the full responsibility for salvation of the disciple,
is the teacher's.

Link:— In the previous verse, Arjuna takes refuge in Lord
Krsna, but he thinks that Lord Krsna wants him to wage the war,
which he regards as unrighteous and so He will again order him
"
126,"Verse 8] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI | 83
to wage war. Secondly, he thinks that perhaps he has not been
able to convey his feelings to Him. So in the next verse, Arjuna
clearly expresses his feelings to Him, against the war.

{Arjuna thinks Lord Krsna, wants him to wage war, so that
he may gain victory and kingdom, and thus his grief may be

‘Avapya bhimavasapatnamrddham rajyam'—Even if I obtain
- an undisputed sovereignty and affluent kingdom, on this earth,
and my subjects become happy and prosperous, and I may have
no enemy on the face of earth, it will fail to remove my grief.
‘Suranamapi cadhipatyam'—Not to talk of worldly pleasure,
even lordship of Indra (the king of the gods) over the gods,
cannot remove my worry and grief. In verses, thirty-two and thirty-
three of the first chapter, Arjuna wanted to turn away from war,
because of his attachment for his kinsmen. But here, he wants to
turn away from war because he thinks that it 1s an obstacle, to
salvation. So there is a lot of difference, between the two situations.
"

""Na hi prapasyami mamapanudyad yacchokamucchosana-

grieved over the loss of a kingdom, it might be overcome by
gaining it. But I am grieved at thinking of the massacre of my
kinsmen. If I gain a kingdom, it will rather enhance my grief,
because who could enjoy the kingdom, after the death of my
kinsmen? Therefore, undisputed sovereignty and an affluent
kingdom on. this earth and lordship over the gods cannot remove
the grief, that is parching my senses. -

providing him with an affluent kingdom, honour and fame. But
it would not wipe out his grief, worry and misery. Therefore,
it was not befitting for him to wage war. So Arjuna speaks his
mind in clear words ""I'll not fight."" ,

Having declared his decision not to fight, and having nothing

senayorubhayormadhye  visidantamidam  vacah

O Bharata (Dhrtarastra, born in Bharata dynasty), Sri Krsna,
as if smiling, addressed the following words to the despondent
Arjuna while in the midst of the two armies. 10
Comment:— | |

""Tamuvaca hrsikeSah prahasanniva bharata senayorubhayo-
rmadhye visidantamidarh vacah'—Agjuna filled with valour and
enthusiasm, had entreated Lord Krsna to place his chariot
between the two armies, so that he could behold the warriors.
It was befitting for Arjuna, to get ready for fighting which was

his objective. But there, instead of waging war, he felt grieved.

So Lord Krsna, started the gospel of the Gita.

‘Prahasanniva'—(Smiling, as it were) means, that when Lord
Krsna perceived that Arjuna’s enthusiasm for the war, had changed
into grief, he smiled. Secondly, in the seventh verse he said, ""Do
instruct me who have, taken refuge in You"". But in the ninth
verse he says, ""I'll not fight"". So Lord Krsna smiled, because
the devotee who takes refuge in his preceptor, just becomes an
instrument in the hands of his preceptor and a preceptor is fully
"
129,"86 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
responsible for the duty of the disciple. The disciple, has no
option but to obey his preceptor and do, as his teacher wishes.
Arjuna's declaration, ‘not to fight’ is practically a withdrawal
from his refuge, in the Lord. ‘Iva’, means that Lord Krsna must
have burst into laughter, after hearing Arjuna’s decision of not
fighting, but He spoke smilingly. , ,
When Arjuna said, “I'll not fight"", Lord Krsna, should
have told him to do, as he wished (18/63). But He thought that
Arjuna, was unable to take the right decision, because he was
overwhelmed with grief and worry. So, there was an overflow
of Lord Krsna's love, for him. God instead of paying attention
: to the words of his devotees, judges them by their feelings. So
Lord Krsna, instead of paying attention to Aruna’s words, ""I'll
not fight,"" started the gospel, from the next verse.
Moreover, He accepts those devotees who take refuge in Him,
even by words as his own, because of His boundless grace.
'Hrsikesah'—'Hrsikeéa’, means that the Lord is the indweller
viz., He knows feelings of beings, Lord Krsna knows, that Arjuna
is turning away from war, because he is overpowered by the
urge of attachment for his kinsmen, and he does not see his
grief melting away, by merely acquiring a kingdom. So he says
""Tl not fight."" But, he also knows that as soon as his delusion
is destroyed, he will act upon His instruction. |
In 'Idarn vacah' uvaca, the use of the word ‘Uvaca’ (spoke),
was sufficient, there was no need to use the word ‘Vacah' (word),
because 'Vacah’' is also included in 'Uvaca.' It seems a repetition,
but actually it is not so. The word, 'Vacah' has been used to point |
out, the secret wisdom, contained in the next verse uttered by
Lord Krsna, in simple and easily understandable language.

'  Appendix—On the sacred (righteous) soil of Kuruksetra on
one side the Kaurava-army is arrayed while on the other side
the Pandava-army is arrayed. In the middle of the two armies a
glorious chariot drawn by white horses is placed. In one part of

that chariot Lord Krsna is seated while in another part Arjuna
is seated. The Lord starts preaching the divine gospel for the
benediction of mankind by making Arjuna, an instrument and
first of all He describes the discrimination between the body and.
(the embodied soul) its possessor.

The Blessed Lord said: _

Arjuna, you grieve for those who should not be grieved at,
yet speak as if a man of wisdom. The wise grieve, neither for the
living, nor for the dead. 11 |
Comment:—

[A man is grieved when he classifies objects and persons,
into two divistons—One's own, and not one's own, such as, our
kinsmen and not our kinsmen, of our caste and not of our caste,
of our stage of life and not of our stage of life, our followers and
not our followers. We have a sense of mine, attachment, love
and desire for those, who we regard as ours. Through these—a
sense of mine and desire etc., faults such as grief, worry, fear,
perturbation, commotion and strain etc., arise. The root of all
faults, is a sense. of mine and desire etc., this is a rule.

At the beginning of the Gita, Dhrtarastra asked, ""What did my
sons and the sons of Pandu do?"" It shows his partiality towards
"
131,"88 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
his own.sons and attachment for them, though the Pandavas,
regarded him more than their father. |
_.. Arjuna also developed the same attachment, but he had no
partiality, he was impartial and so he uses the terms ‘Seeing all
these relations’ (1/28) and 'How can we, by killing our own
kinsmen, be happy’ (1/37). It means that, Arjuna had attachment
for the Kuru family, and because of possibility of destruction of
the family, he was grieved. To remove this grief, Lord Krsna
preaches the gospel of the Gita, which begins with this eleventh
verse. In the end, Lord Krsna declares that there is no justification
for Him, to grieve and he should take refuge in Him, alone, and
not grieve—'Grieve not’ (18/66). The reason is, that dependence
on the world leads to grief, while supreme or exclusive devotion
to the Lord, leads to the state which-is free from faults such as
grief and worry etc.] a

'ASocyananvaSocastvam'—There are two things in the
world—real and unreal, the soul and the body. Both of these
are not to be grieved at as the real is imperishable, and therefore,
should not be grieved for and the unreal, is bound to perish, as
it is perishing every moment, so it should not be grieved at. It
means that these are grieved at, only because of ignorance or
lack of discrimination. Whatever circumstances, in the form of
birth-death, profit-loss etc., a man finds himself in, are result of
his fate viz., his previous actions. It is sheer ignorance to feel
happy or sad, in those, favourable or unfavourable circumstances,
because these are transient. )

'Prajiavadamsca bhasase’— On the one hand, you speak words

of wisdom, but on the other hand, you grieve. It shows that you

are merely talking tall, actually you are not wise, because the
wise do not grieve, for anyone.

You also say that with the destruction of a family, its
age old traditions disappear, women become depraved and
there ensues an intermixture of castes, which leads to hell and
"
132,"Verse 11] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 89
deprived of the ritual offerings of rice-balls (Pinda) and water,
their manes also fall—these words, as of the wise, also prove
that a body is perishable, while the soul is imperishable. Had the
soul not been imperishable, how could you have feared the fall
of the killers and members of the family? Further, you would
not have worried about the fall of manes. Your worry and fear
prove, that a body is perishable while its master, the soul is
eternal. So it is not right to grieve for them.

'Gatasiinagatasumsca'—It is out of ignorance, that you
grieve for the bodies because these will-all perish. You should
not lament for them. Such grief is a mistake. |

| It is also a great mistake to grieve for those who are dead
because they. suffer torture, if their people, grieve for them. The
departing soul has to drink and eat the tears and phlegm* shed
by people here. Similarly, we should not grieve or worry for
those who are living, because grief (worry) does not help them,
in anyway. We should rather care for and help them.

Arjuna's limbs were giving way and his mouth was getting
parched. The root of such feelings, is his identity with the body.
Such identity creates affinity for those who nurse this body.
That affinity gives birth to grief and worry in thinking of their
death. So one is grieved (worried) and sad after thinking of
those, who are living as well as those who are dead. One is
grieved (worried) about the dead because deprived of the ritual
offerings of rice-balls and water, the manes, have a downfall —
(1/42), and he is worried about the living ones, because they
are arrayed on the battlefield, staking their lives and property
(1/33). Both types of worries relate to their bodies. So they are
of the same character.

* The departing soul has to eat and drink the phlegm and tears shed by the
relatives. So we should not lament the death of a relative but should perform
obsequies (Paficatantra, Mitrabheda 365).

The departing soul hereafter drinks the tears shed by the relatives here
(Skanda Purana, Brahma. Setu. 48/42).
"
133,"90 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2

_: Instead of grieving, for those who are dead, we should offer
ritual water and rice-balls.etc., because it is our duty. Similarly,
we should make arrangement to care for those who are living.
So we should give a serious thought to it which enables us to
understand our duty, while worry (grief), destroys the power of
thinking. | | .

_ ""NanuSocanti panditah'—Discrimination between the real and
: the unreal, is called ‘Panda’ (wisdom), and one who has developed
discrimination, is known as 'Pandita’ (wise). Such wise men do
not grieve, because they can discriminate between the real and
the unreal—the imperishable self (soul) and the perishable body.
Grief arises, only when the unreal is accepted as real 1.e., when
there is a desire to maintain the body forever. For the real, there

is no grief or worry, at all. ,
| Appendix—tThere is one division of the body (Sarira) while
another division is of the self (Sariri). Both have no relationship
at all with each other. Both are quite different in nature. One is
| insentient while the other is sentient. One is perishable while the
| other is imperishable. One is mutable while the other is immutable.
One is kaleidoscopic while the other remains the same for time
immemorial—‘bhitagramah sa evayarn’ (Gita 8/19), ‘Sarge’ pi

nopajayante pralaye na vyathanti ca’ (Gita 14/2).

_ The body and the self—both are not to be grieved. The
body ever perishes, therefore it is not to be grieved, while the
self never perishes, therefore it is also not to be grieved. One is
grieved only because of one’s own folly. The body is continuously
separating automatically while the self is ever attained to all. The

- wise men who know this distinction between the body and the
self, never grieve for any being whether dead or alive. In their
view the division of the changing body is different from that of
the never changing self i.e., the ever existent entity. |

_ The gospel of the Gita begins with the discrimination between
the body and the self. Other philosophical classics describe the
"
134,"Verse 11] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 91
“self? and the ‘non-self in an objective manner and it becomes
a matter of study but the Gita instead of describing the self and
non-self objectively, describes ‘deha-dehi’, ‘Sarira-Sariti’ (body —
and its owner) on the basis of the personal experience of all
persons. This is uniqueness of the Gita. The striver who wants
to attain salvation first of all must know ‘Who I am’. Arjuna
has also asked Lord Krsna to tell him the highest good for him
(Gita 2/7). Salvation .can only be attained by discriminating the
self from the body. So long as a man holds ‘I am body’, he
may listen to gospels, may preach gospels to others, may practise
spiritual discipline but salvation is not possible. .
| It is a blunder to accept (assume) a thing, which is not one’s
own, as one’s own and to disown a thing which is one’s own.
Only the thing, which may ever live with us and with which
we may ever live can be our own. The body in the same state
doesn’t stay with us even for a moment while God ever lives
with us. The reason is that the body belongs to the class of the
world, while the self belongs to the class of God. Therefore it is
the greatest blunder to assume the body as one’s own and not to
assume God as one’s own. In order to rectify this blunder, the
Lord in the Gita first of all describes the discrimination between _
the body and the self and awakens the striver to the fact, “You
(self) are not the entity which dies viz., you are not the body. You
are the knower while the body is ‘the known’ (the Gita 13/1).
You are eternal and pervade everywhere ‘nityah sarvagatah’ (Gita :
2/24), ‘yena sarvamidarn tatam’ (Gita 2/17) while the body is
unipresent. You are a resident of the divine world while the body
is a resident of the matter (mortal) world. You are a fragment
of God—‘mamaivamso jivaloke’ (Gita 15/7) while the body |
is a fragment of ‘Prakrti’ (Nature)—-‘manah sasthanindriyani
prakrtisthani’ (Gita 15/7). You ever live in immortality while
the body ever lives in mortality. By the decay and death of
"
135,"92 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 2
the body you don’t decay and die in the least. Therefore, you
shouldn’t be obsessed by grief, worry and fear etc.

The self is not attached and limited to anybody, therefore
it is said to be pervading everywhere—‘sarvagatah’ (Gita 2/24),
‘yena sarvamidarh tatam’ (Gita 2/17). Therefore the true nature of
a striver is merely an ever existent entity, not Sariri (one having
a body) rather it is ‘aSari’ (having no relation with the body).
Therefore the Lord has also designated it as ‘3%™1='—unmanifest
(Gita 2/25), ‘xerorelyart’ unmanifest beings (2/28), the body is
decaying every moment and it is “Asat’. “Asat’ has no existence
‘aradt feed sra:’ (2/16). How a striver having relationship with the
body even whose existence is not there can be termed ‘Sarin?
A striver is neither ‘Sarira’ (body) nor ‘Sariri’ -(dehi). In this
section the Lord has used the term ‘Sariri’ (dehi) for the ever
existent entity in order to explain it to the strivers. By calling it
as ‘Sariri’ He means to say that a striver is not body.

When we reflect upon the nature of the body and the self,
we perceive that the body and the self have their own identity
and when we don’t reflect upon them, then they have also their
own identity. On reflection there is no difference in the reality
of their true nature but by reflecting upon them the striver’s
delusion is destroyed and the human life becomes successful
by attaining its aim.

In human life there is predominance of discrimination.
Therefore “I am not body’—this discrimination is possible only
m the human body. The sense of ‘Il’ and ‘mine’ in the body
is not the work of human intellect but that of beastly intellect.
Therefore Sri Sukadevaji Maharaja says to king Pariksit—

tvam tu rajan marisyeti paSubuddhimim4m  jahi

na jatah pragabhiito’dya dehavattvarh na_ nanksyasi

(Srimadbha. 12/5/2)
"
136,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 93

‘O King! Now give up this beastly intellect that you will die.
As the body was non-existent in the past, it was born afterwards
and will die in future, it is not the case with you (the self) that
you were non-existent in the past, were born afterwards and
will die in future.’

unwise to grieve for what is imperishable.

Comment:—

[There are two things in the world, the soul (the real) and
the body (the unreal) and both of these are not to be grieved
for, because the soul never ceases to be and the body is ever
perishable. So here it is explained that the soul is immortal, while
the body is mortal.] |

kings were also non-existent before our birth. But it is not so.
All of us certainly existed, because the real is always existent,

declaration could suffice. But contrarily it is said—'I, you and
these kings had no such pre-existence—this is not true’. The
reason is, that by the latter expression ‘that there was no such pre-
existence—is not true’, the fact of their pre-existence is emphasized.
"
137,"94 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
It means, that the real is eternal..It was never a naught. By the
term ‘Jatu’, the Lord. means to say that in all tzmes—past, present
and future and in all climes, circumstances, states, incidents and
things etc., this real never ceases to be ever.

Here, by using the word 'Aham' Lord Krsna identifies Himself
with other people, in order to explain that the real never ceases
to be, while in the fifth verse of the fourth chapter Lord Krsna
says, ""You and I have taken many births. I know them all, while
you don't know”, which shows that He as the Lord, is different
from other. In the fifth verse of the fourth chapter, the Lord
expresses His excellence, eminence and glory as compared to
ordinary mortals, while in this verse He expresses His unity,
with the soul of common men.

""Na caiva na bhavisyamah sarve vayamatah param'—In future,
the bodies will not continue to be the same and one day they
will perish, but the (soul) will never cease to be, because the
real is eternal. It was, neither non-existent in the past, nor will
be in, future. |

_ Lord Krsna has talked about the past and the future, by saying
that there was never a time, when they were non-existent, nor
they will cease to be. But, He has not talked about the present,
because they are clearly seen at present through the bodies. In
their present existence, there is no trace of doubt. But if we think
seriously, we come to know that we (the soul) exist at present,
but the bodies are kaleidoscopic. Therefore we should realize
that the soul is different from the bodies, because we have our
existence, at present as we had in the past and we will have, in
future, while the bodies are perishable. |
A man realises his existence, before sleep and after sleep,
but he has his existence during sleep also ever while his body is
undergoing changes every moment, and it will perish one day.
Similarly, the bodies of all of us—I, you and these kings—did
not exist in the past, nor will exist in future and presently also
"
138,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 95
perishing, every moment, but our. self existed in the past, will
exist in future, and exist now.

Our entity is transcendental as we living subject know
time—present, past and future objectively. Subject is always
distinct from object. Thus the Lord has spoken this verse to
explain this transcendental entity of the Self.

Lord Krsna, in this verse says that-the bodies are perishable
while the self is imperishable. It is a rule, that what exists in
the beginning and the end, also exists in the middle, and what
does not exist in the beginning and the end, does not exist in
the middle, either.

But the question arises that how, in the middle these bodies
are visible? The answer is that senses, mind and intellect, with
which we see and worldly objects, which are seen—both are
perishable and change every moment. Man (self) identifies himself,
with the seen. Then, he is called a seer. When the instruments of
perception and the objects of perception, are all perishable and
transient, then how can the apparent onlooker, be permanent? The
apparent entity of a seer (onlooker) is there, because of .affinity
between the seer, the senses and the seen. In case, there is no
such affinity, then this apparent entity of the seer fades away.
But, the base of the apparent entity which is truth, persists. That
truth, is called the base of creation, preservation, destruction
and illuminator of all seeming entities. These names—base and
illuminator are only in relation to objects which they base and
illumine. In the absence of those objects, the truth ever remains,
as it is. He who has an eye for that truth, can never grieve. This
way, ‘I’, ‘you’ and ‘these kings’, are not to be grieved at all.

Appendix—-In this verse there is the description that God
and the self both are endowed with the same characteristics. The
Lord declares, “I as Krsna, you as Arjuna and all these people as
"
139,"96 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
eee EEE DAO eer
kings neither existed in the past nor will exist in future. But all
of us as ever existent entity existed in the past and will also exist
in future. It means that I, you and these kings—these three are
different as far as the bodies are concerned but they are the same
as far as the self is concerned. The bodies neither existed in the
past nor will exist in future but the entity of the soul (self) did
exist in the past, shall exist in future and does exist at present.
When these bodies didn’t exist, the entity of the self was there
and when these bodies will cease to exist, that entity will still ©
remain. There is nothing else except one ever existent entity.
I, you and these kings—by saying so the lord means that the
| entity of God and entity of the embodied self are one and the
same viz., in ‘Is’ and ‘Am’ there is only one pure consciousness.
: It is because of ‘J’ (ego) that ‘am’ is used. If there is no affinity
for ‘I’ (ego), then ‘am’ will not remain but only ‘Is’ will remain.

tatha dehantarapraptirdhirastatra na muhyati

Just as boyhood, youth and old age, changes in this physical
body do not affect the soul likewise is the change to another body.
Wise man never gets disturbed about this. 13
Comment:— |

'Dehino'sminyatha dehe* kaumaram yauvanam jara'—The
body, does not remain the same, but it always changes. It
passes by stages, through babyhood, youth and old age. The
statement 'Dehino'sminyatha dehe’, proves that soul is separate
and the body is separate. The soul is the ‘Seer’, and the body
is the ‘Seen’. Hence the changes of babyhood and youth etc., in
the body, are not in the soul. The soul is changeless.

""Tatha dehantarapraptih'—As, one does not grieve for the body
when it passes through babyhood, youth and old age; similarly
one should not grieve, when the soul passes on, to another body.
As babyhood, youth and old age are different stages of physical
body, so (attaining) another body after death, is a stage, for the
subtle and causal body.

If we perceive in the right perspective, we come to know,
that the body does not pass through babyhood, youth and old
age only, but it changes every moment. Similarly, subtle and
causal bodies, also change, every momentT.

Now, the question arises, that we can perceive our physical
body, but we do not perceive our subtle and causal body and

* The bor one passes through babyhood, youth and old age; but here 'Deha’
has been used for the human body.

T The physical body is left by a man (soul) when he attains another body.
But subtle and causal bodies are not left until he attains salvation. He has affinity
for them so long as he does not attain salvation.
"
141,"98 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
their change. Wakefulness, sleep and sound sleep respectively,
are regarded, as states of physical, subtle and causal bodies. In
sleep, (dream) a baby sees itself as a baby, a youth sees himself
as a youth and an old man sees himself, as an old man. It proves
that a subtle body, also changes. Similarly, in childhood one
gets more soundsleep than in youth, and in old age, it further
decreases. It shows, that there is a change in causal bodies also.
Secondly, a man is more refreshed in his childhood and youth
after sleeping, than he is in his old age. It also proves, the
change in causal bodies.

When one acquires the body of a god, a bird or an animal
etc., (because of identification of the self with the body), one
thinks oneself as the same, it is a change in subtle body. Similarly,
the nature (habit) of a god is different from that of a bird or an
animal. It shows change, in causal body.

A man passes through babyhood, youth and old age and
thus there is a change 1n his body but he experiences, that he is
the same.* It proves, that there is no change, in his 'self' (soul).

Here a doubt comes to our mind, that we experience a
change in the physical body, but we have no knowledge about
our previous bodies, after getting new bodies. The answer is,
that there is so much of pain at the time of death and rebirth,
that one forgets one's previous birth. When a man suffers from
paralysis or old age, his memory becomes weak. Similarly,
by the pangs of death and .birth, one becomes oblivious of
his previous birtht. But, one who dies suddenly, without any
pain, can have a memory of his previous birth.

* In the sacred books this knowledge is called ‘Pratyabhijfia’.

t A man dies by becoming unconscious because of much pain amidst
his lamenting kinsmen (Srimadbha. 3/30/18). At the time of death his breath
stops and memory is lost (Simadbha. 3/31/23).

+ The impression of the previous birth of those who die suddenly and then
are reborn suddenly, continues for sometime but as they grow up, their dream
like old memory is lost (Mahabharata, Anusasana. 145).
"
142,"Verse 13} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 99
When a man rises, after a sound sleep, he says, that he slept
soundly and he was not aware of anything. It means, that he
knows that he was not aware of anything, during sound sleep.
This knowledge of nothingness by the self, proves that the self
existed, even during sound sleep. Thus, his own self existed
before his sleep, during his sleep and also, after his sleep i.e., the
self (soul) exists continuously. None, feels its non-existence at
any time, rather he feels his existence, incessantly. He who feels
himself separate from the body, realizes that he is liberated and
in that liberated state he ever remains so. In that liberated state,
he may not know what bodies he possessed in the past, but his
realization that he is separate from the body, remains intact.
‘Dhirastatra na muhyati'—The wise man (enlightened one),
is he, who can discriminate between the real and unreal. Such a
man, 1s never deluded and he is not reborn, because attachment
for the gunas (qualities, modes), is the cause of birth in good
and evil wombs, and he breaks off his attachment with the
qualities (modes). |
Here 'tatra', has been used, for the difference between the
soul (spirit) and the body, the real and the unreal, the permanent
and the transient. It means, that these are totally different and
one is never deluded about this, because he knows, that he is
different from the body. |
Appendix-——The body never remains uniform while the self
never becomes multiform. The body neither existed before birth
nor will exist after death and at present also it is dying every
moment. In fact the process of its death begins as soon as it
comes to the womb. At the death of boyhood, youth ensues, at
the death of youth, old age ensues and at the death of the old age,
the embodied self passes on to another body. The body undergoes
all these states. Boyhood, youth and old age—these three states
are of the physical body and passing on of the embodied self
to another body is the state of the subtle body and the causal
"
143,"100 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
body. But the entity of pure consciousness transcends all these
states. The states change while the self remains the same. Thus
the enlightened one, who discriminates the distinctiveness of the
body from that of the self, is never deluded.

The embodied soul in order to reap the fruit of its actions
goes to numberless wombs, to hell and heaven. This utterance
proves that eighty-four lac forms of life are left, heaven and hell
are left but the self ever remains the same. Womb (bodies) change __
but the self (Sariri) doesn’t change. The self remains one, so it
goes to several wombs and several worlds. The entity which goes
to several wombs does not get tainted with anyone, doesn’t get
entangled anywhere. If it gets tainted and entangled anywhere,
then who will reap the fruit in eighty-four lac forms of life? Who
will go to heaven and hell? Who will attain salvation?

Birth and death are not our (of the self) traits but are the traits
of the body. Our age viz., age of the self is beginningless and
endless within which several bodies are born and they die. As we
change several clothes but by changing clothes we ourselves don’t
change, we remain the same (Gita 2/22); similarly the entity of
the self even by transmigrating to several bodies ever remains the
same. It means that our freedom and detachment are axiomatic.
Our life doesn’t depend on a particular body. Because of being

_ detached, we even by transmigrating to several bodies, remain
the same, but by assuming our attachment to the body, we have
to take birth in several wombs. The assumed attachment doesn’t
stay but we go on getting attached to other things and persons
etc. If we don’t get attached to them, salvation (detachment) or
independence 1s self-evident or spontaneous.

Link:—Now, Lord Krsna urges us that we should be indifferent
to sorrow and suffering, arising from transitory and perishable
things, like the body etc.

O son of Kunti, bodily sense-objects, which give rise to the
feelings of heat and cold, pleasure and pain efc., are transitory
and fleeting, therefore, Arjuna bear these patiently viz., remain

unaffected by them or ignore them. 14

Comment:—

(Here a doubt arises that in the verses from the eleventh to
the thirteenth and then again from the sixteenth to the thirtieth
there is a context of the spirit and the body, why are then these
two verses about contacts of 'senses with objects’ inserted in |
between? The explanation is that in the twelfth verse as the Lord
placed Himself also in the category of the other people, here He
wants to say that the body is equally transient as other worldly
objects are and therefore these two verses fit in the context.]

'Tu'—'Tu' (indeed), has been used to explain, that transitory
things, such as bodies etc., are different, from the permanent soul.
'‘Matrasparsah'—Senses, including the inner sense, are called

‘Matra’ and 'Sparsah, means ‘Contact’. Therefore, all objects which

are perceived by senses, are called 'Matrasparsah (bodily senses).'

Can affinity with objects, also be included in 'Matrasparsah'? No.

The reason is, that it is not ‘inner sense’, but the ‘self’, which

accepts this affinity and that affinity remains, even when the

objects are lost.* A woman bereaved of her husband fifty years
ago, and if anyone called her as the wife of her husband Mr.

A, she becomes alert, even today. It shows that the assumed
* The affinity with the unreal can perish only if we deny it. Actually the

self has no affinity with the unreal. But it has accepted this affinity. So it can't

be rooted out by any other means such as penances etc. It will be rooted out only
when we cease to accept it.
"
145,"102 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
affinity, has not yet broken off. It means that though objects
are lost, yet the assumed affinity persists.

'Sitosnasukhaduhkhadah'—Here, ‘Sita’ (cold) and 'Usna' (hot),
stand for favourable and unfavourable circumstances. Favourable
circumstances, give us pleasure while unfavourable ones give
pain. If the terms ‘Sita’ and 'Usna mean cold and heat, then
these will represent only objects of touch and their meanings
will be limited. These will not represent all sense-objects, and
circumstances. Therefore, it is proper to take their meanings,
as ‘favourable’ and ‘unfavourable’ circumstances. The fact is,
that the favourable (desirable) or unfavourable (undesirable)

. circumstances and things cannot give pleasure or pain, but it is
the affinity with them, which is the cause of pleasure and pain.
So the Lord has called the objects 'Sukhaduhkhadah' (producers.
of pleasure and pain). | :

‘Agamapayinah'—All objects, have a beginning and an end,
they are born and disappear. So they are 'Agamapay7, i.e., they
appear and disappear.

‘Anityah'—It may be said, that objects may not have pre-
existence or post-existence, but in between, they do exist. The
Lord declares, that as they are 'Anitya’ (transient) they do not
exist even, in the interim. They change, every moment. They
change, so swiftly, that no one can see them, again in the same
form, because they do not maintain the same shape, the next
moment. Therefore, the Lord has called all objects, as 'anitya.'

It means, that all worldly objects are transitory and fleeting, .
and they change every moment. Not only objects, but the senses,
including the inner sense with which we perceive objects, are
also transitory. There is always a change, in them. For example,
the senses get tired by the evening, while working throughout a
day and get refreshed in the morning, after a night's sleep.

Here, all objects in a gross sense are called 'agamapayinah'
(appearing and disappearing). In a finer sense, these are called,
"
146,"_—_—
Verse 14] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 103
‘anityah’ (changing every moment). In a more fine way, they
will be described in the sixteenth verse of this chapter, as ‘asat’
(non-existent), while the soul described earlier, as eternal will be
called as 'sat', (ever-existent), in the sixteenth verse of this chapter.
Mere knowledge, of agreeable and disagreeable senses
is not at all defective. But attachment with and aversion to
them or pleasure and pain, in relation to them is a fault. Not
to be affected by such an evil, is expressed by the expression
‘tarhstitiksasva’. |
Secondly, the body and senses and their actions, have a
beginning and an end, while you as a spectator, are different from
them. They always change, but you never change. Therefore, you
: should remain unaffected by them i.e., you should ignore them.
To remain unaffected (untainted) is called here, 'titiksa’. :
| Appendix—aAs the body never remains uniform but changes
every moment, similarly all the worldly objects (Prakrti viz.,
Nature and its evolutes) which are perceived by senses-mind-
o intellect, never remain uniform, they undergo union and disunion.
| We feel happy with the union of those objects which we like and
7 their disunion makes us sad. We feel happy with the disunion of
5 those objects which we don’t like and their union makes us sad.
e Objects are also fleeting and transient. Similarly the senses and
E the inner faculty are also fleeting and transient and the pleasure
E or pain caused by the union or disunion of these objects is also
a fleeting and transient. But the self ever remains the same, it is
. immutable and eternal. Therefore one should bear them (pleasure
. and pain) patiently viz., one shouldn’t feel happy and sad by their
"" union and disunion but remain unaffected by them. Pleasure and
P pain—both are different but their seer is one and he is separate
- _ (unaffected) from both of them. By seeing the changeable, the
a immutability of the self (soul) is naturally perceived as the
aq unchangeable only can see the changeable.
4 oo Hence the term ‘Sita’ stands for favourableness while
q ‘usna’ stands for unfavourableness. It means that when it is
"
147,"104 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
very much cold, a tree dries up and when it is very hot, then
also a tree dries up; therefore the result of both ‘hot’ and ‘cold’
is only one. Therefore the Lord orders to bear them viz., to rise
above them. |
Pleasure-pain, joy-grief, attachment-aversion, desire-anger etc.,

are fleeting and kaleidoscopic while the self (soul) remains the
same. A seeker commits a blunder that he sees the changing
condition but doesn’t perceive the self. He accepts the condition
but doesn’t accept the self. The condition neither existed in the
past nor will exist in future; therefore it doesn’t exist at present
also though it appears to exist. But in the self there is neither
beginning nor end nor middle at all. A condition never remains
uniform and the self never becomes multiform. Whatever is
seen is a ‘condition’ and the intellect which sees it is alsoa ©
‘condition’. The thing which is to be known is a ‘condition’
and the thing which knows it is also a ‘condition’. In the self
there is neither anything to be seen nor there 1s one who sees it;
there 1s nothing to be known nor one who knows it. The object
to be seen and he who sees it etc., are subject to conditions.
The object to be seen and the seer who sees it—will not remain
but the self will remain, because the condition will perish but
the self will remain. It means that by having connection with
the object to be seen (scene), the self becomes the spectator.
If it has no connection with the object to be seen, the self will
remain but it will not be named as the spectator. In the same
way the self (pure consciousness) by having affinity for ‘Sarira’
(body) is called ‘Sariri’. If it has no relationship with the body,
the self will remain but it will not be named ‘Sarin’ (Git 13/1).
Therefore the Lord has used the term ‘Sarin’ for the self or pure
consciousness in order to merely explain it to human beings.

| Link:—In the next verse, Lord Krsna talks of the result of
remaining unaffected with objects.

O the best of men, a person to whom pain and pleasure are

Comment:— |
- 'Purusarsabha'—Men, generally try to change inevitable
circumstances. But, Arjuna instead of trying to change these,

| has thought of attaining benediction, which shows, that he is
the best of men. |

‘Samaduhkhasukham dhiram'—A resolute person remains
alike in pleasure and pain. He experiences pleasure and pain,
only when he is attached to three gunas (qualities, modes) born
of matter (nature) (Gita 13/20-21). But when he gets immersed
in the self, he does not experience pleasure and pain, and
becomes unruffled. :

'Yarn hi na vyathayantyete purusam'—To a man of steady
wisdom, the sense-objects do not give pain. Pleasure, ensuing
from the contact of sense-objects, is perturbing (Vyatha). Similarly,
pain arising from their separation is also disconcerting. .He
who has an eye for equanimity cannot be happy or sad. by
these objects. Such a person knows what are favourable and
unfavourable circumstances, but he remains unaffected by them.
They do not leave any impression, on his mind.

'‘So'mrtatvaya. kalpate'—Such a man of steady wisdom,
becomes eligible for immortality viz., he acquires the
capability of realizing immortality. Being capable, he realizes
immortality instantly, because his immortality is axiomatic. It
was only because of ones affinity with objects (body etc.,) that
it was obscure.
"
149,"106 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2

This human life, has not been bestowed upon man to experience
pleasure and pain, but to attain the supreme bliss having obtained
which, he has nothing else to seek (Gita 6/22). If we remain
greedy and desirous of acquiring favourable circumstances, we
shall not be able to make use of those circumstances, because our
energy will be wasted in the enjoyment of those circumstances,
rather than in making proper use of these. Similarly, if we grieve
over unfavourable circumstances or in their possibility, we will
not be able to make use of them, rather we will be brooding
over these. To get pleased over favourable circumstances is
their enjoyment. The use of favourable circumstances, for mere
maintenance of a body, and for the welfare of poverty-stricken
people, is their proper use. Thus, riches in the form of favourable
circumstances, should be considered, as property of the poor.
We should neither be pleased with desirable circumstances, nor
displeased with undesirable ones, but we should make the best
possible use of these. Otherwise, we shall have to suffer pain.

It is a proper use of desirable circumstances, if having
satisfied our needs, we use these to serve the needy and the
destitute, instead of enjoying these ourselves. Actually, our riches
are for the needy and the poor. So we should utilize these for
their welfare. These are, the poor and the destitute, who have
enabled the rich to be proud of, their mches. Had all others been
multimillionaires could these millionaires have had pleasure and
pride out of their being millionaires? No. The poor and destitute
people, are the cause, of their pleasure and pride. Therefore, the
rich people should serve the desolate and the destitute, as it is
their duty to do so. But if they don't do so and enjoy the riches
themselves they only are thankless. |

Now, the question arises, how to make use of undesirable
circumstances. The answer is that undesirable circumstances
are painful, when there is desire for pleasure. If that desire 1s
"
150,"Verse 15] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 107
renounced, then undesirable circumstances cannot be painful. If
a patient is given bitter medicines and painful injections, he
is not upset, rather he is pleased, because he knows that bitter
medicines and painful injections, are cures for his disease. Thus,
it is the proper use of undesirable circumstances, to bear pain,
without having any grudge, against it. If one gets displeased with
bitter medicines etc., then that is brooding over unfavourable
circumstances. It will result in great misery. |

If we enjoy pleasure and are tormented by pain, we may
get heaven or hell but cannot be eligible for salvation, because
salvation, is attained by those, who remain alike in pleasure and pain.

: The Lord, in the fourteenth verse, has said that objects give
rise to feelings of pleasure and pain, but these are transitory and
fleeting. The moment we acquire them, their decay and parting
starts. These were neither with us in the past, nor will remain
in future and present, also they are going to be naught. But by
enjoying these we are spoiling our nature, and are depriving
ourselves of attainment of salvation. Therefore, if we make proper
use of the available circumstances, we shall rise above pleasure
and pain, and attain a state of the highest bliss.

Appendix—the self is in the form of an entity. In that entity
there is no perturbation. When the self identifies itself with the
body, then perturbation ensues. Therefore a person who assumes
himself to be seated in the body can’t be free from torment. Freedom
from torment means—not to rejoice on obtaining what is pleasant
and not to grieve on receiving what is unpleasant (Gita 5/20).
By being free from torment a man’s intellect (understanding)
becomes firm—‘sthirbuddhirasammudhah’ (Gita 5/20).

To rejoice and to grieve in favourable and unfavourable
circumstances means to be tormented. To rejoice and to grieve
is ‘bhoga’ of pleasure and pain. The seeker of pleasure and
sufferer in pain can never be happy. A striver should not rejoice
and grieve in favourable and unfavourable circumstances but
"
151,"108 | SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA (Chapter 2
should utilize these circumstances. The favourable and the
unfavourable circumstances are determined by fate; and to utilize
those circumstances by regarding them as material for spiritual
progress, is the real valour. This valour results in immortality.
Utilization of favourable circumstances is to provide happiness
to others and to render service to them; while the utilization of
unfavourable circumstances is to renounce the desire for pleasure
or favourable circumstances. By utilizing the unfavourable
circumstances a striver discovers the reason for pain. The
reason for pain is the desire for pleasure—‘ye hi sarnsparsaja
bhoga duhkhayonaya eva te’ (Gita 5/22). The person (bhogt)
who enjoys pleasure and suffers pain has a downfall while he
(yogi) who utilizes pleasure and pain, by rising above pleasure
and pain, attains immortality.

time-fire consumes the world, in such a way that no remains,
are left. There is total annihilation of the world. Therefore, it
has been said, that the unreal has no existence.

'Nabhavo vidyate satah'—The real never ceases to be. The
Atma (spirit or soul) remains constant. It existed, before the birth
of the body, exists now, when the body is undergoing change |
and will exist, after the death of the body. Similarly, God also
ever remains the same, while the world undergoes a change,
every moment. : oe

The world is kaleidoscopic, it changes every moment. So it
cannot be seen in the same state, the very next moment. Bodies
are taking birth, and dying every moment, but the process is not
perceived, with these dull physical eyes.* Similarly, the. world
is also perishing, all the time. But it is not perceived, because
the senses, mind and intellect etc., also belong to the same
class, to which the world belongs. So, how can the perishable
perceive, the perishable? Only the imperishable (self), (spirit)
can perceive it.

Secondly the self cannot perform any activity, without
assistance of the world (body, senses, mind and intellect). It
proves, that all activities take place in the world rather than,
in the self. The self has no affinity with activities, and objects.
It proves, that the world, with body, mind, senses and intellect
etc., is non-existent. Only the super soul (God), is ever existent,
who ever remains untainted and is the basis and illuminator, of
the entire world.

'Ubhayorapi drsto'ntastvanayostattvadarsibhih'—Seers of truth,
have perceived the truth, about the reali, and the unreal, or the

* Though there is a continuous process of birth and death of bodies, yet the
process is not perceived because of the subtle speed of time.
"
153,"1100 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
soul and the body. The fact is, that the real is ever-existent, the
unreal has no existence, but it seems to exist because of the light

of the real. Therefore.the essence of the real (Sat), and the unreal
(asat) 1s ‘sat’, (ever-existent). The real has been called as ‘Para
Prakrti’ (higher or sentient nature) (Gita 7/5), 'Ksetrajna (self,
soul) (Gita 13/1-2), ‘Purusa’ (spirit) (Gita 13/19) and ‘aksara' (the
imperishable) (Gita 15/16), while the unreal has been called 'apara
prakrti’ (lower or insentient nature), Ksetra (non-self), prakrti
(matter) and 'Ksara' (the perishable).

Arjuna is grieved by thinking, that the warriors will die. So, the
Lord explains that the real never dies, and the unreal never exists
as it is continuously dying. Therefore, it is not wise, to grieve.

In the eleventh verse, it has been said, that 'pandita’ (the
wise) grieve neither for the living, nor for the dead. In the twelfth
and thirteenth verses the word ‘dhira’ (wise or enlightened) has
been used for the person, who: realizes the distinction, between
the soul and the body; in the fifteenth verse also ‘dhira’, has
been used for a person who does not grieve over, the decay
of the body and the world, In the sixteenth verse ‘tattvadarsi'
(the seers of truth), has. been used for a discerning person, who
distinguishes between the real and unreal. All these words dhira
etc., show that the wise do not grieve and if they grieve, it
means, that they are not wise. |

Appendix—The ever-existent entity (self) 1s real and except
that entity whatever Prakrti (Nature) and its evolutes (actions
and objects) are, they are all unreal and kaleidoscopic. Those
great souls who have perceived the truth about both the real
and the unreal viz., those, who have realized the self, hold that
the unreal has no existence and the real never ceases to be viz.,
there is nothing except that entity (the real).

The Lord in the fourteenth and fifteenth verses described the
transitory nature of the body; here the same has been described
by the expression—‘nasato vidyate bhavah’ (the unreal has no
"
154,"Verse 16] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI Wy
existence); and in the twelfth and thirteenth verses the eternal
nature of the ‘Sariri’ (self) was described, that has been mentioned
here by the expression—‘nabhavo vidyate satah’ (the real never
ceases to be).

‘Nasato vidyate bhavo nabhavo vidyate satah’—In these
sixteen letters there is the gist of all the Vedas, Puranas and
scriptures. ‘Asat’ and ‘Sat’—these two have been called by
several names such as ‘Prakrti’ (Nature) and ‘Purusa’ (self),
‘Ksara’ (perishable) and ‘Aksara’ (imperishable), ‘Sarira’
(body) and ‘Sariri’ (self), transitory and eternal, perishable and
imperishable etc. Whatever is seen, heard, understood, thought

| of and determined etc., is ‘unreal’ and the organs of senses, by
which the actions of seeing, hearing and thinking etc., are done,
are also ‘unreal’ and whatever seen is also ‘unreal’.

In the half verse (sixteen letters) three roots have been used—

(1) ‘bhii sattayam’—as ‘abhavah’ and ‘bhavah’ |

(2) ‘as’bhuvi’—as ‘asatah’ and ‘satah’ |

(3) ‘vid sattayam’—as ‘vidyate’ and ‘na vidyate’

Although these three roots mean only an ‘entity’ yet in their
subtle: form they have also their independent meanings—as the
meaning of ‘bhu’ root is ‘utpatti’ (origin), the meaning of ‘as’
root is ‘satta’ (entity) existence and the meaning of ‘vid’ root
is ‘vidyamanata’ (existence of the present).

The meaning of the expression ‘nasato vidyate bhavah’ means
‘asatah bhavah na vidyate’ viz., the unreal has no existence or
the unreal is non-existent because it is continuously perishing _
(changing). The unreal is not present. The unreal is not acquired.
The unreal is not constant. The thing which is born, certainly
dies—this is the rule. As soon as it is born, it starts perishing
at once. It perishes so quickly that no one can see it two times

| viz., having seen it once, it can’t be seen in the same condition
the second time. This is the principle that the thing which has
no existence at any time is always non-existent. Therefore the
"
155,"112 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
world is always non-existent. However existence we may give
to the world, however importance (value) we may attach to it,
but it doesn’t exist at all. The unreal is neither acquired, nor
was acquired nor will ever be acquired. It is not possible to
acquire the unreal.

- ‘Nabhavo vidyate satah’—This expression means—‘satah
abhavah na vidyate’ viz., the real never ceases to be rather the
real is existent, it is never non-existent (changeable). The entity
which ceases to be is not called the real. The entity of the real is
ever-existent. The real is ever present. The real is ever attained.
The real 1s ever constant. |

| The real never ceases to be in any place, thing, person,
action, incident, circumstance, state and time etc. The reason Is
that the place, time and thing etc., are unreal (kaleidoscopic) but
| the real ever exists the same, in it there is never any change,
jt never ceases to be. Therefore the real is ever-existent. To
whatever extent we may deny the existence of the Supreme
Soul, to whatever extent we may neglect Him, to whatever
extent we may have disinclination for Him, to whatever extent
we may disregard Him, to whatever extent we may contradict
His existence by giving arguments but He never ceases to be.
The non-existence of the real is not possible. No one can destroy
the imperishable entity (Gita 2/17).

‘ubhayorapi drstah’—Seers of truth have not created
(produced) the real entity but they have seen it viz., perceived
the truth about it. Jt means that non-existence of the unreal
and existence of the real—the truth of both of these have been

| perceived by the liberated enlightened souls who perceive only
the real entity viz., realize the self-evident ‘Is’. The base of the
unreal is also real and the truth about the real is also real—by
knowing this, in the view of the exalted souls no other entity
except. the real entity ‘Is’ remains.

The non-existence of the unreal and the existence of the
"
156,"Verse 17] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 113
real prove that only the real exists. In that real entity there is
no such duality as ‘deha’ (body) and ‘deh?’ (self).

So long as the unreal’s existence is assumed, there is
discrimination. But when the unreal ceases to exist, then
discrimination changes into Self-realization. ‘Ubhayorapi drsto’-
ntastvanayostattvadarsibhih’—in this expression in ‘Ubhayorapi’
there is discrimination; in ‘antah’ there is Self-realization and
in ‘drstah’ there is perception of the real viz., discrimination
changed into Self-realization and only the entity remained. There
is nothing except that entity—this is the most important fact of
the Discipline of Knowledge. |

| The unreal has no existence—this is true and the real never
ceases to be—this is also true. It is the duty of a striver to accept
this truth. A striver may have this realization or not, he has to
accept this fact. One has to accept the entity ‘Is’ and to deny
‘No’—this is Vedanta, this is the main gist of the Vedas.

In the world in spite of the appearance of both—existence
and non-existence there is predominance of ‘non-existence’.
In God also both of them appear, but there is predominance
of ‘existence.’ In the world within ‘non-existence’ there are
existence and non-existence and in God within ‘existence’ there
are existence and non-existence. In other words in the world
within ‘eternal disunion’ there are union and disunion while in
God within ‘eternal union’ there are union and disunion (meeting-
separation). Therefore in the world only non-existence persists
while in God only existence persists.

real and the unreal.

| avinasi tu tadviddhi yena sarvamidam tatam
vinasSamavyayasyasya na kaScitkartumarhati

Know that to be imperishable, by which all this world
is pervaded; for none can bring about the destruction, of the
indestructible. 17
Comment:— |

‘Avinasi tu tadviddhi'—Here 'tu' (indeed), has been used to
explain ‘Sat’ the real out the two 'sat' (real) and '‘asat' (unreal),
described in the preceding verse.

The Lord advises Arjuna, to realise that imperishable entity.
He explains that this entity is abstract. By calling it abstract,

: (paroksa), the Lord means to say, that this abstract imperishable
entity, is pervading the whole world, which appears as separate,
from that entity. In reality, only this all-pervading entity exists,
while the world which appears to exist, does not exist really.

By the term '‘tat' (that), it is not meant to say that ‘sat tattva'
(the real), stands afar, but it means, that it is not a subject of
senses and inner sense.

""Yena sarvamidarh tatam'*—The abstract-entity is described
here. This whole world, is pervaded by that imperishable entity.
As ornaments made of gold have nothing but gold, weapons
made of iron, have nothing but iron, pots of clay have nothing
but clay, and in ice, there is nothing but water, similarly, this
world is pervaded by ‘sat’ (real) (imperishable). So, in the world,
there is nothing to be realised except the real.

""Vinasamavyayasyasya na kaSscitkartumarhati'—The spirit

* Yena sarvamidam tatam’ has been used in the Gita three times. Here it
has been used for the imperishable by which the whole world is pervaded. It is
described with the view of 'Sankhyayoga' (the Discipline of Knowledge). In the
twenty-second verse of the eighth chapter it has been used for God (Supreme
Purusa) Who can be attained by exclusive devotion. Again in the forty-sixth verse
of the eighteenth chapter there is the description, ‘By whom all this 1s pervaded’
which also is with the point of view of devotion.
"
158,"Verse 17] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 115
(Soul), is imperishable,* while the body is perishable, and
is perishing every moment. No one, can check its process of
destruction. But whether you wage war or withdraw from it, the
imperishable cannot be destroyed and the perishable cannot be saved.

Here the word ‘asya’ means, that whatever reality appears
in the kaleidoscopic body, is because of real entity (self), and
that self (spirit), is different from the body. — :

Appendix—lIn practical life we say, “This is a man, this is an
animal, this is a tree, this is a house’ etc. In these expressions
‘man, animal, tree, house’ etc., neither existed in the past nor
will exist in future and at present also they are perishing every
moment. But in them the eternal reality ‘Is’ ever remains the
same. It means that ‘man, animal, tree, house’ etc., are the world
(unreal) and ‘Is’ is the imperishable Self (the real). ‘Therefore
‘man, animal, tree, house’ etc., are different but in all of them
‘Is’ (Eternal reality) remains the same. Similarly in ‘I am a man,
I am an animal, I am a god’ etc., bodies are different but ‘am’
or ‘is’ remains the same.

‘Yena sarvamidam tatam’—This expression here has been
used for the embodied soul while in the twenty-second verse of
the eighth chapter and. in the forty-sixth verse of the eighteenth
chapter, this expression has been used for God. It means that
the self has the same charactenistics as all-pervading God has.
Therefore as God is detached from the world, so is the self
naturally detached from the body and the world—‘asango hyayam
purusah’ (Brhada. 4/3/15), “dehe’sminpurusah parah’ (Gita 13/22).
The self is not seated in a particular body. It is not attached to
any body. But without realizing this detachment, it is following |
the cycle of birth and death. |

PIOSTSESE me

* In the Gita the Lord has called the spirit as well as Himself imperishable.
But the difference is that the Lord incarnates and conceals Himself by His free-
will while the spirit seated in Matter takes birth and dies because it identifies
itself with the body.

These bodies acquired by the imperishable, indefinable and
eternal soul, are spoken of, as perishable. Therefore, OQ Arjuna,
fight. 18
Comment:—

'Anadsinah’'—A thing, which never changes, never decays
and never gets extinct, in the least, by any cause, under any
circumstances, 1s called ‘anas1'. The soul (spirit), is not exposed to,
destruction or change. So, it is indestructible or imperishable.

'Aprameyasya'—The soul, is beyond the domain of senses,
speech and mind, so it is indefinable. It can be experienced, only
by having faith in scriptures, and saints and their gospels.

The scriptures and saints, do not compel anyone to have faith
im them. One, is free to have such faith or not to have it. In case
one reposes faith in them, that ‘tattva’ (reality), is the object of
his faith, otherwise it is not the object of, his faith.

'Nityasya'——-The soul, does not undergo any change, it never
ceases to be, it exists all the time.

'Antavanta ime deha uktah Saririnah'—-These bodies, of
imperishable, indefinable and eternal soul, are spoken of as
perishable i.e., they have an end. It means that these are perishing,
every moment. They are nothing but, a mass of decay.

In the above sentence, a singular number, has been used
for the soul, while plural for the bodies. Firstly it is so because
the bodies of every embodied soul are of three kinds—physical,
subtle and causal and secondly because a single soul, pervades
all worldly bodies. Further in the twenty-fourth verse, the Lord
calls it all-pervading viz., omnipresent. It means, that all the
bodies are perishable, while soul is imperishable.

*T
"
160,"Verse 18] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 117
All the bodies which, are perceptible, are perishable, while
the soul is imperishable and eternal. But this immortal soul,
though different from body, identifies itself with the body and
develops ‘an ego’ or 'I'ness with it, and thus regards its death, as
self's (soul's) death. He who identifies himself, with wealth and
learning etc., calls himself as wealthy and learned etc. Similarly,
when one accepts a body, as one's own, one develops the feeling
of attachment or mineness for it, and this attachment, extends
to wealth and family etc., because he accepts these as his own,
by having affinity with these. By this affinity of ‘T'ness and
'Mineness'’, all evils are born, one cannot discriminate, between
the real and the unreal, and is thus grieved, while the wise are
not grieved, because they realize that the real cannot perish and
the unreal cannot exist. _

'Tasmat* yudhyasva'—Lord Krsna directs Arjuna, to fight |
i.e., discharge his duty, by discriminating between the real and
unreal. He means to say, that he should not grieve but wage war,
because the soul is imperishable, while bodies are perishable.

In the seventeenth and eighteenth verses, there is a notable
explanation of the real and the unreal, because the Lord wants
Arjuna, to realize the real. By realizing the essence, one gets rid
of the unreal, spontaneously. Thus by realizing this fact, he would
discharge his duty. It shows, that every human being, without any
distinction of caste, creed, colour or stage of life, can freely follow
either the Discipline of Action, or Discipline of Knowledge, for —
his salvation. But, in practical life, a duty should be discharged, |

* Here the word ""Tasmat', has been used for drawing a conclusion after
reasoning. In the Gita ‘Tasmat' has been used either for drawing the conclusion
after reasoning or at the end of a context. In 2/30, 3/19, 8/7 and 8/27 verses it has
been used at the end of a context while in 2/25, 2/27, 2/37, 2/68, and 11/33 it has
been used to conclude reasoning. |
"
161,"| 118 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter2
, according to one's varna (caste) and asrama (stage of life), by
oe following the ordinance of scriptures. Therefore, here while
discussing the real and the unreal according to the discipline of
| knowledge Lord Krsna, orders Arjuna to fight or in other words he
: advises Arjuna to discharge his duty even if he follows discipline

of knowledge. |
| Further, in the thirteenth chapter, where there is a description
of virtues of knowledge Lord Krsna in 13/9, also lays emphasis
| on non-attachment, and non-identification of the self, with a son,
wife, home etc. If only hermits, had deserved the Discipline of
knowledge (Sankhyayoga), the Lord would not have mentioned,
the need for non-attachment and non-identification of the self,
with a son, wife, home etc., because hermits, have no sons,

wives and homes etc. _

Thus, by meditating on the Gita, both the Disciplines of
Knowledge, as well as Action (Karma), have proved to be
independent means, for God-realization for all human beings,
without distinction of any varna or stage of life. |

Appendix—The Lord at the outset of His gospel explained
that both ‘gatastin’ (dead) and ‘agatastn’ (living) are not to be
grieved for. Then in the twelfth and thirteenth verses in order

. to explain that ‘gatasuin’ is not to be grieved, He explained the
real (the eternal) and in the fourteenth and fifteenth verses in
order to explain that ‘agatasun’ 1s not to be grieved, He described
the unreal (the transitory).. Then He explained both ‘Sat’ (the
real) and ‘Asat’ (the unreal) in the sixteenth verse. After that
by discussing the existence of the real and non-existence of the
unreal specially in the seventeenth and eighteenth verses, He

. completes this sub-topic.

Though there is existence only of the soul, not of the body,
yet a man commits an error that he first sees the body and then
perceives the soul in it; first sees the form (appearance), then

perceives the existence. How long will this outward polish stay?
"
162,"Verse 19] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 119
A striver should reflect upon whether the soul (self) existed first
or the body existed first. On reflection it is proved that first there
is the self and then there is the body, the existence is first and
the appearance is afterwards. Therefore a striver first should
perceive the self as existent, not the body.

Link:— Upto the previous verse, there is description of seers
who know the soul, as imperishable. In the next verse, Lord
Krsna to emphasize the same fact, speaks of those, who do not
regard the soul as indestructible, by a negative inference.

Both of them are ignorant, one who holds the soul as, the
slayer and the other who considers it, as slain; for the soul, neither
slays, nor is slain. 19
Comment:— ae

""Ya enam vetti hantaram'— One who considers the soul as
slayer is ignorant because the soul does not act. But by identifying -
with the body, it accepts itself as a doer. As an artisan, however |
clever he may be, cannot work without tools, similarly, the soul |
without body cannot do anything. Therefore, the Lord, in the :
thirteenth chapter, declares, that he who sees that all actions are
performed by prakrti (nature) alone, realizes the self, as non-doer
(13/29). It means, that the self is not a doer. But, by identifying
Itself with body it assumes Itself to be the doer of actions,
performed by the body. If a man, does not identify himself with
the body, he is not at all, a doer, of any activity.

'YaScainam manyate hatam'—One who holds the soul as
slain, is also ignorant. As the soul is never the slayer, so it is
"
163,"120 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
never killed, because the soul, always remains unaffected and
unchanged. Only the perishable and changeable, can be slain.
How could the imperishable and unchangeable, be slain?
'Ubhau tau na vijanito nayarn hanti na hanyate'—~Both of these,
who holds the soul as slayer, and he, who considers it as slain,
are ignorant. A question arises, whether he, who holds the soul
_as slayer, as well as slain, is not ignorant. The answer is, that
he is also ignorant, because the soul is neither a destroyer, nor
can it be destroyed. It is always the same, without any change.
Therefore, one should not grieve. |
The soul, has been described, neither as a slayer nor as slain,
| because it was in the context of war, before Arjuna. But, actually
the soul, is free from all acitons and modifications. 7
Appendix—This Sariri (the possessor of the body) neither
slays anyone nor is slain by anyone—it means that it is neither
a doer of an action nor is an object of action nor is affected
in anyway. Those, who, like the body, hold the Sariri as the
slayer and as the slain, indeed don’t attach importance to the
discrimination between the body and the self but attach importance
| to indiscrimination.

body, is slain. 20

Comment:— |

[The body constituted of elements, undergoes six kinds of
modifications—to be born, to exist, to change, to grow, to decay
and to perish. But, the soul remains unaffected by, these changes.
The Lord explains this fact, in this verse.]

'Na jayate mriyate va kadacinna'—The soul, unlike a body
is never born, it is eternal. So the Lord in 15/7, has declared,

| ‘This soul in the body, is an eternal portion of Myself.’

The soul never dies. Only that, which is born, dies. The
soul remains unaffected by all kinds of changes. Of all these
changes, birth and death, are the most important ones. Therefore,
the Lord has used 'Na jayate’ and 'Ajah', for the unborn and
also ‘Na mriyate, and 'Na hanyate hanyamane Sarire, for the
unslain, twice.

‘Ayam bhitva bhavita va na bhiyah'—This imperishable
element, does not exist, on coming into being, unlike a
child, that exists after bith and has a beginning and an end,
it is free from different kinds of changes and is without
beginning and end.

'Ajah'—This soul is never born, so it is called ‘Ajah' viz., unborn.

'Nityah'—The soul is eternal. It does never decay in the least
while the bodies and senses decay and lose their strength.

'§avatah'—The soul is constant and changeless.

'Puranah'—It is ancient and primeval. Generally a thing
which becomes old does not grow, it rather perishes. But the
soul neither grows nor perishes.

'Na hanyate hanyamane Sarire'—The soul is not slain even
when the body is slain. Lord Krsna means to say that the body
"
165,"122 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
undergoes six modifications because it is perishable while the
soul is imperishable.

Here in these verses Lord Krsna has made such a distinction
between the body and the soul, as is rarely found anywhere else
in the Gita.

Arjuna was grieved after thinking about the death of his
kinsmen in the war. So Lord Krsna wants to explain to him
that the soul is not killed even when the body is slain, so he
should not grieve. |

Appendix—Our (of the self) nature and the nature of the body
are quite different. We (the self) are not attached to the body,
are not mingled with the body. The body is not attached to us, it

| is not mixed with us. Therefore at the death of the body we are
not affected at all. By now we have passed through innumerable
bodies, but what difference did it make in our entity (existence)?
What loss did we sustain? We remained the same—‘bhutagramah
sa evayam bhitva bhutva praliyate’ (Gita 8/19). Similarly at the
death of the body we’ll remain the same.

As hands, feet and nose etc., are organs of the body, likewise
the body is not an organ of the self. That which flows and varies
is not an organ* (of the imperishable) as phlegm and _ urine
etc., flow and an ulcer (boil) varies, so they are not organs of
the body. Similarly the body which flows and varies is not an
organ of the self.

Link:—In the nineteenth verse, Lord Krsna told Arjuna
that soul neither slays, nor is Slain. In the twentieth verse, He
explained how it is not slain. Now, in the next verse, He explains
how it does not slay. 7 |

O Partha, How can, a man who realises this soul to be |

Comment:— |
'VedavinaSinam nityam ya enamajamavyayam katham sa 7
purusah partha karh ghatayati hanti kam'—The man, who realizes |
this soul to be imperishable, eternal and free from birth and
decay, can have no inclination to slay, anyone or cause anyone, |
to be slain. He is free from egoism i.e., he has no feeling of an
agent in him, and so actions do not taint him.
' Here, Lord Krsna has explained that the soul 1s free from |
six kinds of modifications (i.e.) to be born, to exist, by the term
‘Aja’, to change, to grow by the term ‘nitya’, to decay by the
term ""avyayam’' and to perish by the term ‘avinasr, |
Now, a question arises, If the Lord by the terms 'na hanyate
hanyamane Sarire’ and 'kam ghatayati hanti kam' had merely to 7
tell Arjuna that the soul is neither a doer nor an object of action 7
then why he used words ‘not a slayer’ or ‘not a slain’ for the soul. -
The answer is that the theme is of a war, so it is necessary to 7
say so. But He means, that the soul, is neither the agent (doer), :
nor the object of action. Therefore, one while discharging duty, |
should not grieve, while slaying anyone or causing anyone to
be slain, but should discharge one's duty, in accordance with the

Appendix—A thing which is produced (born) certainly perishes,
it has not to be perished (destroyed). But the thing which is not
born, never perishes. We passed through eighty four lac forms of
bodies but no body stayed with us and we didn’t stay with any
body; but we remained the same and apart. Those bodies didn’t
possess this power of discrimination but only this human body
has been endowed with it. If we don’t realize it, we disregard
the discrimination bestowed upon us by God.

As a person discarding worn-out clothes, puts on new ones,

which are new. 22

| Comment:—

_ 'Vasamsi jirnani yatha vihaya navani grhnati naro'parani
tatha Sarirani vihadya jirnanyanyani samyati navani dehi'—In the
thirteenth verse of this chapter, it has been mentioned in brief that
a wiseman does not get deluded, when the soul, transmigrates from
one body to another. Now, Lord Krsna by giving an illustration
explains, that as a man by casting off old clothes is not grieved,

| so a man casting off worn-out bodies, should not grieve.

Here the word nara’ (man), has been used for a human being,
including men-women, boys-girls, young-old etc., all.

As a man discarding old clothes, puts on new ones, so
does an embodied soul, casting off worn-out bodies, enter into
new bodies. The casting off, of worn-out bodies is called death,
while its acquiring new bodies, is called birth. So long as, this
embodied soul has connection with prakrti, it goes on acquiring
néw bodies, according to actions of the past, or according to
thoughts. at the moment of death.

Here the term 'Sarirani’ (bodies), has been used in plural
"
168,"Verse 22] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 125
form. It means, that so long as an embodied soul, does not get
emancipated, it goes on acquiring new bodies, upto eternity. The
bodies, it has acquired are countless. The term ‘dehi’ has been
used, to indicate, all embodied souls. |

In the first half of this verse, there is mention of discarding
of worn-out clothes, while in the second half, there is reference
to casting off worn-out bodies.* So, how can the illustration of
old clothes befit bodies, when bodies of even children and young
men, die? The answer is, that end of age, means the worn-out
bodies, whether they are of children, youngmen or old men.

In this verse, the Lord by using the terms, 'yatha' (as) and
'‘tatha' (so), has explained that as a man, discarding worn-out
clothes, puts on new ones, so does an embodied soul, casting
off worn-out bodies, acquire other bodies, which are new.

Here, a doubt arises, that a man is free in casting off old
clothes and putting on new ones, but he is not free to cast off
an old body and enter into a new one. The answer is, that Lord
Krsna does not mean to talk about freedom and dependence. His

aim is to dispel the grief, arising from the separation of a body.
One should not grieve, over the death of a body, because the
soul remains unattached and unchanged. From this angle, this
example is appropriate.

Another question that arises is, that a man is happy by
discarding old clothes and putting on new ones, whereas he
feels grieved, while casting off an old body and getting into
a new one. The reason is, that a man by identifying himself
with a body, wants to live long and thinks of the death of the
body, as his own death. Thus, he gets sad. The grief (sadness),
is the result of the desire to live, not because of death. 'I may

* If we perceive by applying our discrimination we come to know that the
body is wearing out every moment and it reaches a stage when it completely dies.
But we don't realize this fact because we don't pay attention to it. This is darkness
or ignorance (lack of discrimination). |
"
169,"126 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
live'—this desire is latent, and he has to die, and that causes
grief. But if he were to discriminate between the real and the
unreal, he need not be sad, he rather rejoices. Thus, it is because
of his ignorance, that he weeps. In his ignorance, he 1s like a
child, who weeps, while his old clothes are taken away and
he is made to put on new ones. To remove this ignorance, the
Lord has used 'yatha' (as) and 'tatha' (so) words, by giving an
illustration of clothes.

Lord Krsna, has used the verb ‘grhnati' for putting on
clothes and 'sarnyati' (enter), for embodied soul, because people
generally think out of ignorance, that man changes clothes,
living at his own place while an embodied soul has to go
and enter new bodies. So Lord Krsna, has used these two
verbs, keeping the worldly point of view in mind.

In the Gita in 'Yena sarvamidam tatam' (2/17), in 'Nityah
sarvagatah sthanuh' (2/24) phrases, the soul has been described as
all-pervading, eternal, omnipresent and constant, while in phrases
such as 'Sarnyati navani dehi' (2/22) and 'Sarirarn yadavapnoti'
(15/8), it is said that the soul migrates (enters) into another body.
So, there seems to be a contrast, but in fact, there is none. For
example, when a person grows from his babyhood to youth, he
says that he has grown young. But the fact is, that he is the same,
it is the body which has grown young. By identifying himself
with the body, he grafts the change of his body upon himself.
Therefore, in fact the soul does not migrate. But, because of Its
identification with bodies, It seems to migrate. |

Now, a question arises, why this cycle of birth and death,
has been going on from times, immemorial. From the view-point
of the Discipline of Action, to reap the fruit of virtuous and evil
actions, and from the view-point of the Discipline of Knowledge
due to ignorance, and from the view-point of the Discipline of
Devotion, due to disinclination for God, this cycle of birth and
"
170,"Verse 22] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI . 127
death goes on. The basic factor behind these three is, that God
has granted liberty to living beings, to make proper use of their
lives, but they misuse it and so they have to go through a cycle
of birth and death. They can be free from this cycle, by making.
proper use of this liberty. It means, that if they start working for
the welfare of others, by renouncing their selfishness, they will
be free from this cycle. Moreover negligence in discrimination*
is the root cause of birth and death. If we attach importance
to discrimination, we can be free from the shackles of
birth and death. Similarly, disinclination for God, is the cause
of birth and death, which can be eliminated by having an
inclination for Him.

Appendix—-A man wants new articles, so the Lord also gives
him new articles (body etc., material). When the body grows
old, God bestows upon him the new body. Therefore ‘having
new desires’ is the cause of his birth and death. Those who have
new desires, will get new things times without number. In a man
there is one power of the will and another of the life-breath. If
he has power of the will and his life-breath ends, he has to be
re-born. If he has no will (desire), he has not to take re-birth
when his life-breath ends. |

An illustration is applicable only to a certain extent, not to
the full extent. Here the illustration of casting off old clothes
and putting on new ones is applicable to the extent that as a
man, by changing several clothes, remains the same, similarly
the self, by casting off worn-out bodies and by acquiring several
new bodies, remains the same. As by casting off old clothes
we don’t die and by putting on new clothes we are not born,

* Negligence in discrimination means that we don't act according to what
we know. We know that it is wrong to tell a lie. But still we do so in order to
achieve selfish ends. We know that it is wrong to give pain to others. But we
derive sadistic pleasure in torturing others. Similarly we know that bodies are
perishable but. we have attachment and infatuation for them. This is known as an
affront to our knowledge. | |
"
171,"128 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
similarly by casting off worn-out bodies, we don’t die and by
acquiring new bodies, we are not born. It means that the body
dies, we (the self) don’t die. If we die, who will reap the fruit
of virtuous and sinful actions? Who will acquire new bodies?
Who will be in bondage? Who will attain salvation?

nainam chindanti Sastrani nainam dahati pavakah

na cainam kledayantyapo na Sosayati marutah

Weapons cannot cut the soul, nor can fire burn it, water cannot
drench it, nor can wind make it dry. 23 |
Comment:— —

'Nainam chindanti Sastrani'—Weapons cannot cut the soul
because they are made of the earth-element which cannot even
reach the soul. So how can they hurt the soul? .

‘Nainam dahati pavakah'—Fire cannot burn the soul, because
the soul is beyond the reach of fire. It means that fire can never
bring any change ever in it. .

""Na cainarn kledayantyapah'—Water cannot drench the soul
because water cannot wet it. Water can never bring any change in it.

'Na Sosayati marutah'—Wind cannot dry the soul because
it 1s beyond the reach of wind. It can never bring any change
in the least in it. —

Thus out of the five gross elements four cannot hurt the soul.
Now, the question arises—why has Lord Krsna not mentioned
the fifth element—ether? The answer is, that Akasa (ether) is
actionless. Earth, water, fire, wind are born of ether and these
are incapable of acting on ether. Therefore, when they cannot
"
172,"Verse 24] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI . 129
even hurt ether, how can they hurt the soul, which is. beyond
the reach of even Matter. or nature (prakrt1)? These elements
with attributes cannot reach the soul, which is without any
attributes (Gita 13/31). | | ne

The soul is eternal. All the four elements such as the earth etc.,
are activated by the power of the soul. So, how can they impair
the soul, the source of their power? The soul is all-pervading,
while the four elements, such as the earth etc., are the pervaded
ones. How can the pervaded ones, hurt the all-pervading one?

Here, the context is of war. Arjuna is grieved at the thought
of the imminent death, of his kinsmen. Therefore, Lord Krsna
explains to Arjuna that the soul cannot be hurt by any weapons.
A weapon can cut the body, not the soul, a fire-emitting missile
can burn the body, but not the soul, the Neptune noose (Varuna
weapon), can drench a body but not the soul, and the wind-
missile can dry the body but not the soul. It means that the soul
is not hurt by any weapons and missiles, it remains the same,
while it is the body alone which decays and dies. So, it is sheer
ignorance to lament for it.

Appendix—We say, ‘This is a body’—there is a change in
the body, but in ‘Is’ (Sariri) there is no change. Similarly when
we say, “There is wood or timber’, then there is variation in
wood, not in ‘Is’. Wood is cut, ‘Is’ is not cut. Wood burns, ‘Is’
does not burn. Wood becomes wet, ‘Is’ doesn’t get wet. Wood
dries, ‘Is’ does not get dry. Wood never remains uniform while
‘Is’ never becomes multiform. :

Comment:—

[In this verse it is described why weapons etc., cannot hurt
this soul.]

'Acchedyo'yam'—This soul is incapable of being -cut. Even
incantation and curse cannot cut this soul, while they can cut the
body, as Sakalya was beheaded by Yajiavalkya's curse, because
the former could not answer the latter's questions.

‘Adahyo'yam'—This soul cannot be burnt by fire, because it

: is Impervious to fire. It cannot be burnt even by incantation and
curses, as the hunter was burnt to ashes, by Damayanti's curse.
Only that can be burnt by fire, which is prone to fire. The soul
is beyond burning. ~ |

'Akledyah'—The soul is impervious to water. Water,
incantation, curse and medicines etc., cannot drench it. As it is
said, that the tune of 'MalakoSa song wets a stone, and moon-light
wets the moon-gem. But the soul cannot be wetted by them.

'ASosyah'—The soul cannot be dried by wind, incantation,
curse and medicines etc., as sage Agastya dried the sea.

'Eva ca'—By using these two words, Lord Krsna means to
say, that the soul is beyond the reach of any action. So it should
not be grieved for. :

_ ‘Nitya'—The soul is eternal, it remains the same all
the time.

‘Sarvagatah'—The soul pervades all men, things and bodies
etc., equally.

‘Acalah'—It 1s immovable, there is no movement in it.

'‘Sthanuh'—It is stable. It does not even shake or vibrate.

'‘Sanatanah'—It is everlasting and beginningless.
"
174,"Verse 25] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 131

The world is transitory, while the soul is eternal. Matter is
kaleidoscopic, while the soul is stable. All things and persons
etc., of the world are movable, while the soul is immovable
and all worldly objects, are subject to birth and decay, while
the soul is everlasting. |

Lord Krsna says that men identify themselves with bodies
and material things, and so they do not realize, that they are
different from worldly things, but even then, the soul remains
uniform and constant, all the time. |

Appendix—‘Sarvagatah’ (All-pervading)—the self does not
mere pervade a body but it is all-pervading—trealization of this
fact is salvation (liberation from worldly bondage). As the body
is seated in the world, we are not seated in the body. We (the
self) have never had our union with the body, we have no union,
won’t have any union and it is not possible to have a union with
the body. The body is quite afar from us. But because of desire,
the sense of mine and identification with the body it appears as
if we have union with the body.

In fact the Sariri doesn’t need the body at all. The Sarii
without the body, also remains in bliss.

‘Avyakto' yam'—The soul unlike a body is unmanifest, because
"
175,": 132 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
| it cannot be perceived by any one of the senses.

‘Acintyo'yam'—Mind and intellect etc., cannot be perceived
by senses but they are thinkable. But this soul is inscrutable.

‘Avikaryo'yamucyate'—The soul is immutable i.e., it does
not undergo any change while matter 1s changing, all the time.
The cause of the entire creation is matter. That causative nature
(matter) is subject to change. The soul is beyond any change,
as it is transcendental.

In the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth verses, Lord Krsna
has described the soul, by giving eight adjectives of negation
and four adjectives of affirmation. But the fact is that it cannot
be described in. words, because how can tongue illumine the
soul, which is an illuminator of the tongue etc.? Therefore, this
realization about the soul is, its real description.

'Tasmadevam viditvainam nanuSocitumarhasi'—Thus, by
knowing (realizing), the soul as uncleavable, incombustible,
unmanifest, everlasting and immutable etc., one cannot grieve.

if one thinks of the soul as changeable, (which is against the
basic (principle), one should not grieve.

O mighty-armed, even if you suppose this soul as
constantly undergoing birth and death, even then, you should not
grieve over it. 26 |
Comment:—

‘Atha cainam nityajatam nityam va manyase mrtam tathapi
tvam mahabaho naivarh Socitumarhasi'—Lord Krsna, by using the
"
176,"Verse 27] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 133
terms, such as ‘atha ca’ and 'manyase' means that it is a fact that
the soul is unborn (Gita 2/20), yet if you accept the contrary,
you should not grieve, because one who is born is bound to
die, and. one who dies, is bound to be reborn. None can escape
this eternal rule.

A seed sown in the earth, assumes different shapes—sprout,
plant, tree and then it dries up and decays. The fact is, that the
seed undergoes change, every moment. If this seed had remained
the same, even for a moment; how had it passed different stages
upto the last one of its drying up, as a tree? It gave up its prior
form—t is its death; and it assumes a new shape—t is its birth.
Thus it passes, through birth and death, every moment. Similarly,
this body also undergoes a change, every moment. Sperm gets
mixed with ovum and the mixture, grows into a baby which is
born. With its birth, the process of death sets in, which culminates
in death. Thus, this body undergoes a continuous change Le., it
is born, it decays and dies. |

Therefore Lord Krsna says to Arjuna that even if he holds
the view that the soul undergoes birth and death like a body,
there is still no ground for grieving.

Comment:—

‘Jatasya hi dhruvo mrtyurdhruvam janma mrtasya ca'—
According to the previous verse, if the soul is regarded as
constantly taking birth and constantly dying, one should not
"
177,"134 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
grieve, because death is sure of him who is born, and rebirth is
assured. of him who is dead.

""Tasmadapariharye'rthe na tvam Socitumarhasi'—This cycle
of birth and death has been going on from time immemorial and
will continue upto eternity. Therefore, you should not lament
over the inevitable. These Dhrtarastra's sons and Bhisma, Drona
etc., who are born will surely die, you cannot save them and
after death, they will certainly take rebirth, you cannot stop it.
So why should you grieve? |

As the sun has risen, it will certainly set, and if it is set, it
will definitely arise. This is an inevitable fact, which is known
to all. Therefore, none grieves over the setting of the sun. It
implies that one should not grieve over the death of anybody.

Whatever the Lord has stated in these two verses (26th and
27th) is not God's real theory. By the expression 'Atha ca’ the
Lord has put forth the argument of the people, who identify,
themselves with the body. This is not a correct principle. In no
case Arjuna should grieve. To bring home this point to him,
Lord Krsna has explained from that angle also.

In these two verses, Lord Krsna says that all the worldly
things, including the bodies, undergo change from one form to
another. Abandoning the first form is called death and change
to the second form is called birth. One should not grieve over
this cycle because it inevitably goes on. :

Appendix—A man is grieved if a dear one dies or there is
loss of money. Similarly we are grieved when we think about
the future—if the wife dies, what will happen? If the son dies,
what will happen? etc. We are grieved and worried because
we don’t attach importance to discrimination. Changes in the
world and in circumstances are inevitable. If circumstances don’t
change, how will the cycle of the world continue? How will a
person pass from boyhood to youth? How will a fool become
learned? How will a patient become healthy? How will a seed
"
178,"Verse 28] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 135
turn into a tree? Without change the world will become like a
static thing. In fact only a mortal dies, an immortal never dies.
It is everyone’s obvious experience that after death the body
remains lying, but the self, the owner of the body transmigrates.
If importance is attached to this experience, there can’t be any
worry or grief. At the death of Bali, Lord Rama draws Tara’s
attention towards this experience— : |
Tara bikala dekhi Raghuraya, dinha jiiana hari linht maya.
. Chiti:jala pavaka gagana samira, paiica racita ati adhama Sarira.

pragata so tanu tava a@gem sova, jiva nitya kehi lagi tumha rova.
upaja jiiana carana taba lagi, linhesi parama bhagati bara magi.

7 (Manasa, Kiskindha 11/2-3)

We should think over when no body remained in eighty-four
lac forms of life, how will this body remain intact? When eighty-
four lac bodies didn’t remain as ‘T’ and ‘mine’, how will this
body remain as ‘I’ and ‘mine’? This discrimination is possible
only in human body, not in other bodies.

Link:—In the next verse Lord Krsna mentions the simple
law of nature about birth and death.

‘Avyaktanidhananyeva'—These beings: will also not: be

'Vyaktamadhyani'—All these beings are manifest in the interim
(after birth and before death). Their bodies were non-existent
before birth and will remain non-existent after death, just like
in a dream. During life they seem to exist but actually they are
going into non-existence every moment. :

‘Tatra ka paridevana'—It is the principle that the thing which
does not exist either before or after has no real existence in its
midstate also. Therefore, these bodies which were unmanifest in
their origin and will be unmanifest in their end, are unmanifest
even now, though they seem visible. But the soul existed in the
past, exists now and will also exist in future. So there is no
point in lamenting for both these situation. |

Appendix—A thing, which does not exist at the beginning
and at the end, has never any existence, while a thing, which
exists at the beginning and at the end, ever exists.* That which
never exists, is “asat’—-unreal (body) and the entity which ever
exists, is “sat’—the reality. We have our eternal disunion with
the unreal while with the real we have our eternal union.

One perceives the soul as a wonder, some speak of it an
amazement while others hear of it in wonderment; while none
knows it even after hearing of it. 29
Comment:— | :

'Ascaryavatpasyati kaScidenam'—The knowledge of the
wondrous self is not achieved through the senses. The self can
be known by the self itself, it is beyond the realm of senses.
As ‘IT am’— this knowledge requires no proof, no instrument,
it is self-evident. Its consciousness cannot be experienced as
separate from 'I'. This is intuited by the person himself. This is
not a subject of senses and intellect. Therefore, the knowledge
of self is said to be a marvel.

The term 'pasyati’ has two meanings—to see with eyes and
to know the self by one's own self. Here it has been used in the
sense of knowing the self by one's own self (Gita 2/55; 6/20 etc..,).

When one sees with one's eyes, there are three things
necessary—the onlooker, the object to be seen and sight Le.,
the power to see. But while knowing the self these three are not .
necessary. 'I am'— this cannot be perceived by senses, mind and
intellect, but by one's own self.

When we want to search for a thing in a dark room, we need
"
181,"| - 138 : SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
eye-sight as well as light. But if there is light-lamp, there is no
need for another lamp to see the lamp which is lit. Similarly,
there is no need for other means to perceive the self. The self
has its own light by which it can be lit and known.

A body is of three kinds—physical (gross), subtle and
causal. The body which is nourished by food and water for its
growth, is physical (gross) body. This gross body is the object
of senses. The subtle body consists of seventeen elements—five
senses, five organs of action, five vital airs, mind and intellect.
The subtle body can be perceived by intellect and not by senses.
The latencies (vasanas) form the causal body. If we reflect, on
the three kinds of bodies, it is evident that the gross body is
not the self, as it changes every moment and it is an object

. of knowledge. Similar, is the case with the subtle body. The
causal body, is an evolute of nature. But the self is beyond
nature, therefore the causal body, 1s also not the self. As far
as, the knowledge of the self, is concerned, it is beyond them
and this knowledge is marvellous. This is. 'ascaryavatpasyati.’
When the soul ceases its identification with the body, it knows
itself and therefore, it has been said that one perceives the soul
as a wonder. -

Here in this verse, as well as, in the third verse of the seventh
chapter, Lord Krsna has used the term 'Kaéscit' i.e., ‘Someone
knows Me in reality.’ It means, that it is very difficult to know
the imperishable, but actually it is not so. The fact is, that it
seems difficult, only because there are a few aspirants, who
sincerely want to know the soul. - |

‘AScaryavadvadati tathaiva canyah'—Other persons speak
of it as marvellous, because it is beyond the reach of words.
Speech is illumined, by the self, then, how can it describe the
illuminator? The great souls who speak of it, can just give a
kind of hint to draw the attention of the listeners. |

Here, the term 'Anyah' has been used to emphasize the
"
182,"Verse 29] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 139
fact, that only a few liberated souls who possess metaphysical
knowledge, can explain it fully to an aspirant and enable him, to
attain the imperishable. All. do not possess the ability to remove
his doubts and give satisfactory answers, to his arguments.

‘AScaryavaccainamanyah srnoti'— Other persons hear of it, as
marvellous. Listening to scriptures and advice of other worlds, is
quite different from voice of the soul. It means, that this soul is
something marvellous and uncommon and is beyond the reach
of senses, mind and intellect etc. [t illuminates these.

Here, the term 'Anyah' has been used to explain the fact,
that the person who hears is different, from the one who knows,

: and from other who 1s capable of explaining it to an aspirant in

such a manner, that its full nature, is revealed to him.

‘Srutvapyenarn veda na caiva kascit'—There are some who do
not know it, even on hearing. It means that, merely hearing, will
not help one to know it. On hearing, when one gets established
in one's own self, one will know one's own self* by oneself.

. Now a question arises, that an aspirant on hearing the words
of scriptures and a preceptor, gets knowledge, why has it been
said then, that there are some who do not know it, even on
hearing of it? The answer is, that it is the aspirant himself, who
by having faith in the words of scriptures and preceptor, gains
knowledge. Otherwise there have been several incarnations of God,
and there also have been liberated souls, who held discourses on
metaphysics, and by hearing their discourses the people should
have gained metaphysical knowledge. But, actually it has not
happened. Their discourses, can be helpful to a striver having
faith, but he, will also have to get himself established in his own
self. This expression does not mean to convey, that knowledge
of the self is impossible; it rather conveys that it is beyond the
senses. However hard efforts by a man may make him to know

* This fact has been pointed out in the Gita several times—(2/55; 3/17;
6/20; 15/11). |
"
183,"140 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
it, ultimately he will have to know himself, by his own self.

What is knowing of the self, by the self? There is a difference
between doing, perceiving and knowing. Doing involves organs
of action, perceiving involves senses, while knowing is done
by the self Itself.

The senses actually do not know; rather they only perceive
which 1s useful in daily activity.

This knowledge, of knowing oneself by one's ownself, is of
two kinds—T am different from the body and the world;’ and
secondly, 'I have identity with God.’ In other words, it can be
said, ‘I have no affinity with the kaleidoscopic, perishable world,

while I have constant affinity with unchangeable, imperishable
God.’ After possessing this kind of knowledge, one can know the
soul in reality. This knowledge, is beyond the reach of speech
and intellect.

Appendix—tThe self cannot be known merely by hearing viz.,
by practice but can be known by having inquisition, by hearing
from enlightened and experienced exalted souls—‘yatatamapi
siddhanarn kaScinmarn vetti tattvatah’ (Gita 7/3). ‘AScaryavadvadati
tathaiva canyah’—it means that out of the enlightened exalted
souls, only someone. can explain its true nature to others. All
the enlightened souls can’t explain it.

As in the world a couple doesn’t get married merely by
hearing but the man and the woman accept each other as wife
and husband and then they are married. Similarly no one can
know God merely by hearing but after hearing, when he accepts
Him himself and gets established in Him, then he will know Him
by his own self. Therefore by hearing a man can learn the facts
pertaining to knowledge, can narrate them to others, can write
them, can lecture on them, can discuss them but can’t realize
the self or God.

One can’t know God merely by hearing but can know Him
by worshipping Him after hearing from others—‘srutvanyebhya
"
184,"Verse 30] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 141
upasate’ (Gita 13/25). If the person, who describes the Supreme
Soul, is a God-realized soul and the listener (striver) has esteemed
faith and inquisition, there can be immediate Self-realization.

dehi nityamavadhyo'yam dehe sarvasya bharata

tasmatsarvani bhitani na tvam Socitumarhasi

O Bharata, this soul residing in the bodies of all, can never be
slain. Therefore, you should not grieve, for any being. 30
Comment:—

‘Dehi nityamavadhyo'yam dehe sarvasya bharata'—The soul,
residing in bodies of men, gods, animals, birds, insects etc.,
cannot be slain i.e., it is imperishable. |

The term 'Avadhyah’, has two meanings—(i) It should not
be slain, (ii) It cannot be slain. For example, a cow should not
be killed, because it is a deadly sin to kill a cow. But in case
of the soul, it does not mean that it. should not be slain, but it |
means that the soul cannot be slain in anyway by anyone. It
has also been mentioned in 2/17, that none can bring about the
destruction of the indestructible substance.

'Tasmatsarvani bhitani na tvam Socitumarhasi'—Therefore,
you should not grieve for all beings because the soul is !
indestructible, while the perishable body cannot remain the
same even for a moment.

Here, ‘Sarvani bhuatani', plural number has been used to
emphasize the fact that, one should not grieve, for any living being.

The body is perishable, because its nature is such. It is
"
185,"142 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
perishing every moment. But, the self is imperishable. If this
reality is realized, then no grief is, possible.

In this section from the eleventh to the thirtieth verses, it
is explained that the soul, which is imperishable and real, is
different from a body which is perishable and unreal. Unless,
one can discriminate between the soul and the body, one cannot
follow anyone of the disciplines, either of Disinterested Action,
Knowledge or Devotion. Not only this, but also one who wants
to go to heaven should know, the distinction between the two.

| _ After the death of a body, who will go to heaven? Therefore, all

the philosophers who are believers, in spite of having different

opinions about philosophy, agree with the fact, that the soul is

. different from the body. Here the Lord wants to explain this
distinction clearly.

This is everyone's own experience also, that a body changes
from babyhood to youth and then to old age. But, there is an
unchangeable one that knows this change. That one, is the soul.
Therefore, the changeable and the unchangeable, can never be
identified. In this section, Lord Krsna, has not used a philosophical
terminology, because people think that philosophy is a subject
for study only. So he has-used such words as, the real and the
unreal, the perishable and the imperishable etc. One, who can
discriminate between the two, is not grieved in the least, while,
one who merely studies philosophy, is grieved. .

A man may study the six systems of philosophy and may

| possess knowledge about the Absolute, the soul, the Nature and
the world. But, his knowledge is purely theoritical. On the other
hand, a striver or a devotee may be concerned who wants to
realize his identity with God or who wants to surrender himself
to God, by renouncing his assumed affinity for prakrti, and the
world, his knowledge is practical. There is a vast difference in
these two sorts of knowledge. . .
"
186,"Verse 30] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 143

Appendix—The Lord has described the discrimination between
the ‘deha’ (body) and ‘dehi’ (possessor of the body) from the
eleventh to the thirtieth verses. While describing this topic Lord
Krsna has not used a philosophical terminology such as brahma-
jiva, prakrti-purusa, jada-cetana, maya-avidya, atma-anatma etc. —
The reason is that the Lord, instead of making it a subject for
study, wants to make it a subject of everyone’s experience and
wants to prove that every man can discriminate the body from
the self. It needs no study, no eligibility.

If a man applies the discrimination between the real and the
unreal on his body, he is a striver (seeker) and if he applies it on
the world, he is learned. By keeping himself aloof, if a person
discriminates between the real and the unreal, he may become
learned by possessing bookish knowledge (not learning) but he
can’t attain Self-realization. But he who discriminates between the
real and the unreal in his own body, can attain Self-realization.
It means that discrimination between the real and the unreal in
the world is for pedantry while the Gita is not for pedantry.
Therefore the Lord, instead of using the philosophical terminology,
has used simple words such as ‘deha-dehr’, ‘Sarira-Sariri’ viz.,
the body and its possessor. Those who discriminate between
the real and the unreal in the world, they keeping themselves
aloof, make themselves the authority on the knowledge of the
Gita. But any person, who discriminates the body from the self
in him, is eligible for Self-realization. For Self-realization the
discussion on discrimination between the body and the self, is
useful and in order to gain learning, the discussion on ‘tattva’
the Divinity is useful. Therefore the striver who wants to realize
the self, first of all should discriminate his own self from the
body that the body has no connection with the self and the self
has no connection with the body viz., ‘I am not body’. He, who
has assumed the existence and greatness (value) of the body
with as much truth, firmness, belief and doubtlessness, should
assume (accept) the existence and value of the Self (Soul) with
"
187,"144 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 2
the same truth, firmness, belief and. doubtlessness and should
realize the self. , | .

The body is the means only for performing an action and an
action is performed only for the world. As a writer uses a pen
only for writing and when he stops writing, he puts the pen at
its proper place, similarly a striver should use the body while
doing an action and should leave the body in its original position
when the work is finished—he should be detached from it. The
reason is that if we do nothing, what is the need of the body?

_ An important fact for a striver is to renounce the known
unreal. If a striver renounces what he knows as unreal, his
: spiritual discipline will become natural and easy and his aim
will be attained. The lovability of a striver for the end (aim) is
called his spiritual discipline. That lovability is not acquired by
anything, person, power etc., or by practice but that is acquired
by having the sense of ‘mine’. for the end (Lord). The ‘person
in whom a striver has the sense of ‘mine’, naturally becomes
lovable (dear) to him. But the real sense of mine is with that
object (or person) in which (or in whom) there are the following
four traits— oo

1. With whom we have identity (oneness) of the self.

2. With whom our relationship is eternal. |

3. From whom we never want anything.

4. To whom we may surrender all what we have. |

These four conditions are applicable only in God. The reason
is that our relationship with the body and the world 1s not eternal
and the category of the self is quite different from that of the
world and body. How can there be identity of the kaleidoscopic
world with the never changing self? The identity of the self with
the body, which is perceived, is not real but is assumed. This
assumed identity is only to perform duty. It means that we can
serve the person with whom.we have. assumed our identity but
we can’t have the sense of ‘mine’ with him. ,
"
188,"Verse 30] _SADHAKA-SANJIVANI (145 —

In order to renounce the known unreal, it is necessary that a
striver should renounce the relationship which our discrimination
does not support. Assuming a person, with whom we have neither
eternal relationship nor identity of the self, our own and for
us, is anti-discrimination relationship. So long as there is anti-
discrimination relationship, no spiritual discipline will lead to —
Self-realization. By having affinity with the body, a person may
undergo austere penance, may have trance, may go round the
world, his delusion can’t be destroyed and the Supreme Truth
can’t be attained. Having renounced the anti-discrimination
relationship delusion is destroyed and the Supreme Truth is
realized. Therefore a striver shouldn’t be at ease without renouncing
the anti-discrimination relationship. If we don’t renounce our
assumed anti-discrimination relationship with the body, the body
will leave us certainly. Then what is the difficulty in renouncing
our kinship with the body? Therefore a seeker may follow any
discipline, he will have to accept the truth, “I am not body and
the body is not mine and it is not for me because I am ‘aSariri’
(self) and the self is unmanifest.” st

So long as a striver has the kinship of ‘I and ‘mineness’
with the body there is no realization of the Supreme Truth and
he remains bound by virtuous actions, useful reflection and
attachment to Trance. He may perform virtuous actions such as
performance of sacrifice, undergoing penances, offering charity,
may reflect upon the soul or the Supreme Soul or be established
in trance, he is not totally free from bondage. The reason is
that assumption of the kinship of the self with the body is the
root of bondage and also of the flaw which causes all flaws. If
the assumed affinity of a striver with the body is totally wiped
out, sinful actions will not at all be performed by him and he
will not be attached to virtuous actions. There will not be any
meaningless reflection by him at all, and he will not be attached
to meaningful reflection. He will not be fickle in the least and
will neither be attached to trance, constancy or absence of all |
"
189,"146 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA _ [Chapter 2
thoughts. Thus at the destruction of attachment of the gross
(physical) body to actions, of the subtle body to reflection and
of causal body to constancy, his aim will be attained viz., his
delusion will be destroyed and the Supreme Truth will be realized.
Therefore the Lord at the outset of His gospel has described the
discrimination between the body and the self in order to wipe
out a striver’s (self’s) relationship with the body.
Link:—Arjuna was grieved, by apprehending the death of his
kinsmen and preceptors. Moreover he was afraid that sin would
accrue to him, by killing them and that sin would lead him to
hell. Therefore Lord Krsna preached this gospel in the eleventh
to the thirtieth verses. Now, He starts the worldly standpoint and
reminds Arjuna of his duty, as a member of the warrior class.

Looking at your own duty as well, you should not falter for
there is, nothing more meritorious to a person of the warrior
class (Ksatriya) than a righteous war. 31 | ,
Comment:— a
[In the first two verses, He describes the benefit of war.]
'Svadharmamapi caveksya na vikampitumarhasi'—Man (soul)
is a fragment of God. But by identifying himself with the body,
noting himself as a Brahmana (of the priest class) or a Ksatriya (of
the warrior class) etc., he has to discharge his duty as a member of
that class. Similarly one who acknowledging himself as a teacher
' ora father, has to discharge the duty of a teacher or a father.
Here, the duty of a Ksatriya has been called ‘Dharma’
(righteousness)*. It is the foremost duty of a Ksatriya not to
* In the eighteenth chapter (18/42— 48) the Lord has described the inate
"
190,"Verse 31] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 147
flee from war front. For a Ksatriya, righteousness is upheld by
waging war. So, Lord Krsna asks Arjuna to discharge his duty,
by waging war. He should never shirk that duty.
'Dharmyaddhi yuddhacchreyo'nyatksatriyasya na vidyate'—
There is nothing more welcome to a man of the warnor. class
than a righteous war viz., which is his main duty (Gita 18/43).
Similar, is the case with, the people of other classes—the priest,
the business and the labour classes. |
Arjuna, in the seventh verse of the second chapter, requested
Lord Krsna to tell him what is good for him. In response to his
request, Lord Krsna tells him, that he would attain salvation by
performing his duty of waging a righteous war. So, he should
not retreat from it. : _
Appendix—Having described the discrimination between
‘deha’ (body) and ‘dehi’ (self) the Lord from this verse to the
thirty-eighth verse describes the performance of one’s duty.
The reason is that the Supreme Truth which is realized by the
discrimination between ‘deha’ and ‘dehi’, the same Supreme
Truth can be realized by the proper use of the body, by
- performing one’s duty. In discrimination ‘knowing’ is. important
and in performance of one’s duty ‘doing’ is important. Though
discrimination is important for a man, as it is useful for him
in practical and spiritual life and also in this world as well as
the other world, yet the Lord mentions performance of one’s
duty for the person, who doesn’t understand the discrimination
between the body and the self, so that instead of becoming a
scholar by possessing bookish knowledge or rot learning, he
may realize the Truth. oo |
It means that a person who wants to know Godhead
but without having a keen intellect and a keen self-denial
(detachment), couldn’t know Him by the Discipline of |
duties of the people of four castes. There the term Dharma’ (18/47) stands for
one’s duty. Thus the terms ‘Karma’ and ‘Dharma’ are synonymous.
"
191,"148 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
Knowledge, he can know the Supreme Soul by the Discipline
of Action (Gita, 5/4-5). :

Arjuna was a Ksatriya (member of the warrior class).
Therefore the Lord has mentioned the duty of a Ksatriya.
In fact here ‘the duty of a Ksatriya’ is the denotation for
the duties of the four ‘Varnas’. Therefore it means that the

members of other “Varnas’ (castes) such as Brahmana (member
of the priest class) etc., should also discharge their duties
(Gita, 18/42—44). [‘Svadharma’ (one’s own duty) has been
mentioned as “Svabhavaja karma’, ‘Sahaja karma’ and ‘Svakarma’
etc., (Gita 18/42—48). Discharge of one’s duty for the welfare
of others, by renouncing selfishness, pride and the desire for
fruit, is performing ‘svadharma’. Discharge of ‘Svadharma’ (one’s
duty) is “Karmayoga’ (the Discipline of Action).]

refused to give them, even as much land as could be covered
by the point of a needle, without waging war. The Pandavas
made several efforts for a compromise, but Duryodhana bluntly
refused. Therefore, Lord Krsna says to Arjuna, ""You have got
this unsought and unsolicited opportunity, for waging a war.
Such a righteous war, is an open gateway to heaven.” |

‘Sukhinah ksatriyah partha labhante yuddhamidrsam'—Those

Ksatriyas, who get such an opportunity are really lucky.

discharging one's duty, is far superior to worldly pleasures which
could be enjoyed, even by animals and birds.

the sixth verse of this chapter, Arjuna raised a question that
they did not know whether they would conquer the sons of

. [Arjuna was thinking that by killing his kinsmen he would
incur sin. So Lord Krsna clarifies that it is not the war but desire,
which induces a man to incur sin. So by renouncing desire, he
should be engaged in war.] | |
""Sukhaduhkhe same krtva labhalabhau jayajayau tato yaddhaya
yujyasva'—In a war a man either gains victory or suffers defeat.
Victory results in gain, while defeat results in loss. Worldly
: people, view gain with pleasure and loss with pain. But your
aim is not to think of victory and defeat, gain and loss, and
pleasure and pain, but your goal is to discharge your duty by
treating the agreeable and the disagreeable, alike. By doing so
you will incur no sin viz., you will be free from bondage.

_. Everyone should discharge his duty earnestly and efficiently,

, whether he has a desire or not for its fruit. By refusing to be
affected by favourable and unfavourable circumstances, the mind
becomes steady. So treating the two equally, one should discharge
one's duty. Moreover, one should not perform an action for the
sake of pleasure, and refrain from another, for fear of its pain.
Scriptures should be the authority in determining what ought to
be done and what ought not to be done (Gita 16/24).

_ ‘'Naivarh papamavapsyasi'—Here, the word, sin, has been
used both for sin and virtue. The former, leads to the bondage
of hell and the latter to the constraints of heaven. Both of these
deprive a man of salvation and binds him to follow the cycle

of birth and death. So, Lord Krsna exhorts Arjuna, to discharge
his duty of waging war, by being even-minded. This will help

him to escape the bondage of both sin and virtue.
In this section of eight verses from the thirty-first to the thirty-
"
198,"Verse 38] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI — 155
eighth Lord Krsna has disclosed several variegated feelings.

(1) While delivering a discourse or explaining a subject, the
beginning should deal with positive aspects, the middle with
negative aspects and the conclusion should again deal with positive
aspects. In this context also, Lord Krsna in the thirty-first and
thirty-second verses, explains the favourable consequences of
discharging one's duty; in the middle from the thirty-third to the
thirty-sixth verses, He explains the adverse consequences of not
performing one's duty; and again concludes, in the thirty-seventh
and thirty-eighth verses, by explaining the favourable consequences
of discharging the duty and orders Arjuna to act accordingly.

(ii) In these verses, Lord Krsna has also clarified the doubts
arising in the mind of Arjuna. For example Arjuna says, ""I don't
foresee any good, ensuing from the slaughter of kinsmen"" (1/31).
Lord Krsna replies in 2/31, ""There is nothing more welcome ,
to a man of the warrior class, than a righteous war."" In 1/37
Arjuna says,""How can we, by killing our kinsmen, be happy?""
Lord Krsna replies in 2/32, ""Happy are the Ksatriyas who get
the opportunity of waging such an, unsolicited warfare."" In 1/44
Arjuna says, ""The consequence of the war will lead to hell."" In |
2/32,37 Lord Krsna says, “The war is an open gateway to heaven.”
In 1/36 Arjuna says, ""Sin alone will accrue to us by waging the |
war and by slaying them.” Lord Krsna replies in 2/33, ""If you
do not wage such a righteous war and abandon your duty, you
will incur sin."" In 1/40 Arjuna says, ""The result of the war will
be that impiety will take hold of the entire family."" Lord Krsna
in 2/33 says, ""If you do not wage such a righteous war, you
will abandon your duty viz., righteousness.""

(a) In 2/5 Arjuna insists and says, ""It is better to live on
alms, than to wage war."" Therefore, Lord Krsna in 2/38, orders
him to wage war. Uddhava had a desire to live with Lord Krsna.
So Lord Krsna directed him to go to the northern mountains
and do penance there (Srimadbhagavata 11/29/41). It means that,
"
199,"| 156 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
desire of any type is an obstacle to salvation.

_ (iv) In these verses Lord Krsna has explained in details some
of the things which were referred to in brief, in the second and
third verses of this chapter. For example earlier the expression
‘anaryajustam’' (it is shunned by noble souls) was used, here the

expression ‘dharmyaddhi yuddhacchreyo'nyat' (any other thing more
welcome than a righteous war) has been used. There the term

‘asvargyam’ (not leading to heaven), was used here the expression

| ‘svargadvaramapavrtam, (an open gateway to heaven), has been
_ used. There the term ‘akirtikaram' not bringing fame was used,
: here the expression ‘akirtim capi bhitani kathayisyanti te'vyayam’'

(all creatures will even recount your undying infamy) has been
used. There, Lord Krsna ordered Arjuna to fight by using the
expression ‘tyaktvottistha parantapa’ here, also, He orders him
the fight by using the expression 'tato yuddhaya yujyasva’.

_ Appendix—The Gita teaches the remarkable art of spiritual
upliftment through one’s own dealings so that a person, under
all circumstances, having all kinds of dealings sanctioned by

the scriptures, may attain salvation. Generally other scriptures
mention that if you want to attain salvation, become a recluse by
renouncing mundane materials and live in solitude because the
mundane affairs and spiritual upliftment can’t go together. But
the Gita declares that at whatever place you are, whatever sect
you follow, whatever principle you live up to, whatever religion,
school of thought, ‘Varna’ (caste), ‘Asrama’ (stage of life) you
follow, by following them if you act according to the gospel of
the Gita, it will lead you.to salvation. The Supreme Truth, which
recluses and saints attained in solitude by practising spiritual
discipline for years together, will be attained in practical worldly
life by following the teachings of the Gita. By becoming even-
minded in success and failure, performance of one’s duty without
the desire for fruit, is to act according to the gospel of the Gita.
What can be more terrible circumstance and activity (action)
"
200,"Verse 39] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 157
than a war? When a man can attain salvation under such a terrible
circumstance and activity as a war, then what other more terribe
circumstance and activity will be there in which he may not attain
salvation? According to the Gita sitting on a seat in loneliness
and meditating on God can lead to salvation (Gita 6/10—13)
and waging a war can also lead to salvation.

Arjuna wanted neither heaven nor kingdom (Gita 1/32, 35,
2/8). He wanted to turn away from the sin which would accrue
by killing his kith and kin (Gita 1/36, 39, 45). Therefore the Lord
appears to say, “If you don’t covet heaven and kingdom and want
to turn away from the sin, discharge your duty of fighting in the
war treating the agreeable and the disagreeable alike, thus you will
incur no sin—‘naivam papamavapsyasi’. The reason is that sin is
not incurred by waging war; but uneven-mindedness (partiality),
desire, selfishness and ego are the causes of sin. It is your duty
(dharma) to wage war. Sin is incurred by not performing one’s
duty and by doing which should not be done.” |

In the preceding verse the Lord seemed to say to Arjuna, “If

you want to gain kingdom and heaven, it is proper for you to

| perform your duty,” while in this verse He seems to say, “If you

don’t want to gain kingdom and heaven, it is proper for you to

discharge your duty by being even-minded.” It means that it is

improper not to discharge one’s duty under any circumstances.

to be guided by even-mindedness, already mentioned in the
preceding verse and he describes its glory.

O Partha (Arjuna), this attitude of mind has been presented to
you from the point of view of Jnanayoga (Discipline of Knowledge);
now hear of the same, from the point of view of Karmayoga
(the Discipline of Selfless-Action). Equipped with this state
of mind, you will be able to completely shake off the shackles
of Karma (Action). 39 |
Comment:— | | |

‘Es te’bhihita sankhye buddhiryoge tvimam Srnu'—Here the
word. 'Tu' (indeed) has been used to show that the description
of the Discipline of Action, is different from the Discipline of
Knowledge. —

The term ‘Esa’ has been used for equanimity, which has
been described in the preceding verse and which has already been
explained in the Discipline of Knowledge, (from the eleventh to
the thirtieth verses). When a man discriminates between the body
and the soul, he gets established in equanimity automatically
because it is attachment to the body which is an obstacle in the
way of equanimity. So this ideal of equanimity has already been
presented from the point of. view of ‘Sankhyayoga’ (Discipline
of Knowledge); now listen to a discourse on equanimity in the
context of 'Karmayoga’ (Discipline of Action).

‘Imam’ (this) term has been used to explain how this
equanimity is attained by the Discipline of Action and what its

_ importance is?

""Buddhya yukto yaya partha karmabandham prahasyasi'—
Arjuna was afraid of the sin that would accrue by waging the
war (1/36, 45). But Lord Krsna says that sin does not accrue
by waging the war as it is your duty, but it accrues by having
attachment and aversion. So if you attain equanimity, no sin
"
202,"Verse 39] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 159
will accrue and your duty of waging the war, will not lead you
to bondage. |

In the seventh verse of this chapter Arjuna asked Lord Krsna to

advise him what was good for him. Hence, Lord Krsna answers his
query. First, He mentioned the means of Sankhyayoga (Discipline
of Knowledge), and then laid great stress on performance of
duty, and told him that there was nothing more welcome to a
Ksatriya, than a righteous war (2/31). Then, He told him that
no sin would accrue, if he had equanimity ( 2/38). Now, He
explains the same equanimity, in the context of 'Karmayoga’
(Discipline of Action).

A Karmayogi performs action to set an example, to the
masses (Gita 3/20) without any selfish motive. By doing so,
he attains equanimity, easily. Having attained equanimity, he is
easily liberated, from the bondage of actions.

This (Thirty-ninth) verse, should have been placed after the
thirtieth verse, as it rightly belonged there, because from the _
eleventh verse to the thirtieth verse, the Lord explained even-
mindedness, from the view-point of the Discipline of Knowledge,
and now He describes it from the view of Discipline of Action.
So it seems improper, to insert these eight verses, from the thirty-
first to the thirty-eighth, here. But really it is not so. The reason
is, that before describing equanimity in the Discipline of Action,
it is necessary to describe, what one ought to do and what one
ought not to do. It was Arjuna's duty, to wage a righteous war. It
was not his duty to abandon war, because by doing so, he would
incur sin. So Lord Krsna, in these eight verses, described what
Arjuna ought to do and what he ought not to do (2/3 1—38). Then,
he explained equanimity. It means, that first from the eleventh
verse to the thirtieth verse, he explained equanimity, through as
elucidation of the real and the unreal, by mentioning that the
real is real and the unreal is unreal and none can change these.
Then, from the thirty-first verse to the thirty-eighth verse, having
"
203,"160 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
explained what one ought to do, and what one ought not, from.
the thirty-ninth verse, He exhorts Arjuna never to desist from

| his duty, but to always perform duty with even-mindedness, in
success and failure.

Appendix—‘Karmayoga’ (Discipline of Action) is divided into
two parts—‘kartavya vijnana’ (the science of duty) and ‘Yoga
vijfiana’ (the science of equanimity). The Lord from the thirty-first
verse to the thirty-seventh verse mentioned the science of duty in
which He described the favourable consequences of discharging
the duty and adverse consequences of not discharging the duty.
Now from this verse to the fifty-third verse He mentions the

: science of equanimity. ,

The equanimity which the Lord mentioned in the preceding
verse, can be attained both by ‘the Discipline of Knowledge’
and ‘the Discipline of Action’. By knowing the discrimination
between the body-division and the self-division and renouncing
affinity with the body-division, is “The Discipline of Knowledge’
while by knowing the duty-division and the non-duty-division and
by renouncing what ought not to be done and discharging one’s
duty, is ‘the Discipline of Action’. A man by following one of
the two disciplines should attain equanimity. The reason is by
attaining equanimity a man is freed from the bondage of action.

One is ‘Dharma Sastra’ (Pirva mimarhnsa) [The scripture for
duty] and one is ‘moksa sastra’ (Uttara mimarhsa) [The scripture
for salvation). Here from the thirty-first verse to the thirty-seventh
verse, there is description of ‘Dharma Sastra’, while from the
thirty-ninth verse to the fifty-third verse there is description of
‘Moksa Sastra’. By ‘Dharma astra’ (discharging one’s duty) there
is both kinds of progress*—mundane and spiritual. In ‘Dharma
Sastra’ the discharge of one’s duty is important. Either call it
‘Dharma’ or duty—it is one and the same.

Not to do what ought to be done is ‘non-discharge of duty’

* ‘vato’ bhyudayanihsreyasasiddhih sa dharmah’ (VaiSesika 1/3, 2/39).
"
204,"Verse 40] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 161
and to do what ought not to be done is also ‘non-discharge of
duty’. Duty is that in which a person having renounced his desire
for pleasure, pleases others and which involves his own welfare as
well as the welfare of others. By discharging one’s duty, ‘Yoga’
(equanimity) is naturally attained. Without discharging one’s
duty a man can’t attain equanimity (Gita 6/3). Having attained
equanimity, knowledge of Truth is naturally attained—-which is
the result of both—‘Karmayoga’ (the Discipline of Action) and
‘Jnanayoga’ (the Discipline of Knowledge). | |

In this path (of selfless action), there is neither loss of effort, nor
any adverse result. Even a little practice of this discipline (dharma)
protects one from great danger (of birth and death). 40
Comment:— |

[Lord Krsna has explained the importance of disinterested
action in the latter part of the thirty-ninth and this fortieth verse
in four ways:—{i) By it, one becomes free from shackles of
actions. (ii) There is no loss in effort. (111) There is no adverse
result. (iv) Even a little practice of it (dharma) protects, one
from great fear.]

'Nehabhikramanaso'sti'—In this path of disinterested action,
there is no loss of attempt viz., the partial practice of this Yoga
(Discipline of Disinterested Action) has its corresponding benefit.
The desire to attain equanimity is the beginning of equanimity.
Such a beginning never gets wasted because desire for attaining
the real is also real. | |

‘Tha’ (in this) means that in this world human beings are
"
205,"162 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter2
authorized to attain equanimity. All other bodies (births) are to
enjoy worldly pains and pleasures, there is no opportunity for
them to do away with attachment and aversion because pleasures
can be enjoyed only by having attachment and aversion. If there
are no attachment and aversion, no pleasure can be enjoyed and
such actions will lead to spiritual discipline.

'Pratyavayo na vidyate'—Actions which are performed with
a desire for fruits, can give adverse result, if there is any error
in the pronunciation of incantations, or in performing sacrifice,
etc. Suppose, a man performs sacrifice, for the birth of a son,
but if it is not performed according to scriptures, it might result
in the death, of a member of the family, instead of blessing him
with a son. Sometime, if the result is not quite contrary, it may
be less harmful, as the son may be born crippled. But, one who
performs actions, without having any desire for fruits, becomes
equanimous and so there is no adverse result from his effort.

What is adverse result? Unevenness of mind, is an adverse
result. Attachment and aversion, is unevenmindedness. This
uneven-mindedness leads to a cycle of birth and death. But,
when a man becomes equanimous, attachment and aversion, are
rooted out and on annihilation of attachment and aversion, there
is no unevenness of mind, and therefore any adverse result, is
out of the question.

'Svalpamapyasya dharmasya trayate mahato bhayat'—Even
a little practice, of this discipline of disinterested action, which
brings about equanimity, protects one from the great fear of
birth and death. So unlike action for fruits, which ends after its
fruits, it does not perish viz., its fruit is not wealth or property,
which are perishable. Equanimity, which a striver attains, by
facing favourable and unfavourable circumstances, gets fixed _
in him and becomes permanent. A devotee (striver), deviating
from the path of Yoga, having enjoyed heavenly pleasures for

- many years and having taken birth in the houses of righteous
"
206,"Verse 40] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI | 163
persons, does not lose knowledge or even-mindedness gained,
in his previous birth (Gita 6/40—45) because this knowledge or
even-mindedness, is real. , —
‘Dharma’ (Duty) is used in two senses—(i) Charity viz.,
kindness, in giving help (money, food, clothes etc.,) to the poor,
and suffering people (11) Discharging one's duty; according to
the ordinance of scriptures. By performing one's duty, without
desiring its fruit, one develops equanimity automatically, because
it is axiomatic. Therefore, here, equanimity has been called
‘Dharma’ (duty). :
Some people opine constant remembrance of God is not useful
unless there is concentration of mind. But the gospel of the Gita,
does not attach much importance to this opinion, it attaches more
importance to equanimity. According to the Gita, a striver who
has attained equanimity, is an exalted soul. Even when, a man
is imbued with all qualities, if he does not gain equanimity,
according to the Gita, he cannot be called, a perfect soul.
This equanimity, is of two kinds—of the mind and of the self.
The Lord, pervades everywhere equally. One who gets oneself
established, in Him, gains victory over the world, and is liberated.
But this equanimity of self, can be known by equanimity
of the mind (Gita 5/19). Equanimity of the mind, consists in
remaining even-minded, in success and failure (Gita 2/48).
Such a person, remains even-minded in praise and reproach,
success and failure, profit and loss, pleasure and pain etc.,
(Gita 5/20). This sort of equanimity, never perishes and it
results in nothing, but salvation. |
Whatever, virtuous actions, such as penance, charity and
pilgrimage etc., are performed by a man, these perish after
giving fruit, but equanimity, does not perish and it leads man
to salvation or God-realization (Gita 5/3), while concentration
"
207,"164 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA . [Chapter 2
of mind, may lead him to accomplishments (siddhis) but not
. to salvation. .

Appendix—-The Lord has mentioned the glory of equanimity
in four ways in the thirty-ninth and fortieth verses—

(i) ‘karmabandham prahasyasi’—By equanimity a man shakes
off the shackles of Karma (action).

(ii) ‘nehabhikraman3So’sti’—There is no loss of effort.

(iii) ‘pratyavayo na vidyate’—There is no adverse result of
this effort. | |

(iv) ‘svalpamapyasya dharmasya trayate mahato bhayat’—Even
a little practice of this discipline (dharma) protects one from the
great danger of birth and death. |

Though in the first point the three remaining points are
included, yet there is a little difference in them; as—

(i) The Lord first in the normal way declares that by
equanimity a man shakes off the shackles of Karma (action).
The reason of bondage is the attachment to the modes viz., it is
his assumed affinity with Prakrti (Matter) and its evolutes (Gita
13/21). In equanimity there is no affinity with Prakrti and its
evolutes; therefore the man is freed from the shackles (bondage)
of action. As in the world many virtuous and sinful actions
are done, but those actions don’t bind us because we have no
relationship with them, similarly the even-minded person has no
relationship with the actions done by his body.

(ii) If equanimity merely begins viz., there is an aim of
attaining equanimity, there is inquisitiveness to attain it, then this
beginning is not destroyed. The reason is that the aim to attain
the imperishable is also imperishable while the aim to gain the
perishable, is also perishable. The aim to gain the perishable leads
to destruction (fall) while the aim to attain equanimity leads to
salvation—‘jijiidsurapi yogasya Sabdabrahmativartate’ (Gita 6/44).

(ii1) There is no adverse result of this equanimity. If there
"
208,"Verse 40] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 165
ener Ee
is any error in pronouncing the sacred text in the performance
of actions which are done. with a desire for fruits, the result of
those actions can be adverse.* But if there is equanimity in life,
and an error is committed, and if there is slip in carefulness, the
action does not give adverse result (bondage). For example if
a paid servant while lighting a lantern in the dark drops it and
breaks it, we are angry with him. But if our friend who never
wants anything from us, drops the lantern and it is broken, we
don’t get angry but ask him not to mind it as it matters little.
Therefore he who performs actions with the desire for fruit, may
have adverse result of his actions but how can the result of the
actions of the person, who doesn’t covet any fruit, he adverse?
It can’t be. |

(iv) Even a little equanimity protects one from the great
danger of birth and death viz., it results in salvation. As actions
done with an interested motive perish after bearing fruit, in that
way even a little equanimity does not perish after bearing fruit
but it only leads to salvation. If virtuous actions such as religious
sacrifice, charity and penance etc., are performed with a desire for
fruit, their result is perishable (gain of money, wealth and heaven

* There is a mythological story that Tvasta performed a religious sacrifice
in order to get a son who would kill Indra. In that sacrifice the sages performed
the sacrifice with the sacred text ‘indraSatrurmh vivardhasva’. In the word
‘indraSatru’ if there is ‘sasthitatpurusa’ compound-word, it means “Indra’s enemy’
and if there is ‘bahuvrhi’ compound-word, it means ‘he whose enemy is Indra.’
By the difference of ‘samasa’ (compound-word), there is difference in sound.
Therefore in ‘sasthitatpurusa’ compound word, the word ‘indraSatru’s’ last letter
‘try’ will be pronounced with ‘udatta’ sound while in ‘bahuvrihi’ compound-word,
the word ‘indraSatru’s’ first letter ‘1’ will be pronounced with ‘udatta’ sound. The
aim of the sages was to do the ‘antyodatta’ pronunciation of the word “indraSatru’
but they did ‘adyedatta’ pronunciation. So because of the difference in sound
in the pronunciation of the sacred text there was adverse result and thus Indra
became the killer of Vrtrasura, Tvasta’s son. Therefore it is said:

mantro hinah svarato varnato va mithyaprayukto na tamarthamaha
sa vagvajro yajamanam hinasti yathendraSatruh svarato’ paradhat

: (Paniniya Siksa)
"
209,"——

166 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
etc.,) and if they are performed without the desire for fruit, their
result is imperishable (salvation). Thus virtuous actions such as
sacrifice, charity.and penance etc., can bear two types of fruit
but the fruit of equanimity is only salvation. As a traveller, while
travelling stops on the way or sleeps, he has not to go back to
the place from where he started his journey but he has covered
the distance upto the place where he stops or sleeps. Similarly

as much equanimity is attained in. life, that never perishes.
-_‘syalpamapyasya dharmasya trayate mahato bhayat’—Even a
little feeling of disinterest is true while fear even being great is
untrue. As for a bundle of cotton, a lot of fire is not required,
| the cotton may be one bundle or a hundred bundles, a match
stick is enough to burn it. When one match stick is applied to
the cotton, the cotton itself becomes fire and helps in burning
the remaining cotton. In the same way detachment is fire and
the world is cotton. Being detached from the world, the world
itself perishes because the world in fact has no existence at the

| root, so one can’t be attached to it.
. The least renunciation 1s real and the biggest action is unreal.
An action ends while renunciation is endless. Therefore actions such
as sacrifice, charity and penance etc., perish after giving fruit (Gita
8/28) but renunciation (renunciation of the fruit of action) never
perishes—‘tyagacchantiranantaram’ (Gita 12/12). By renouncing
the egoistic notion only, infinite universes are renounced because
this sense of ego has sustained the entire universe (Gita 7/5).
There may be a big heap of grass, can it face fire? It may be
very dark, can it face light? If there is a fight between darkness
and light, will darkness win? Similarly if there is a fight between
ignorance and knowledge, will ignorance win? Can the greatest
| fear face fearlessness? Equanimity even if it is a little is complete
and fear even if great is incomplete. A little equanimity is great
. because it is true and the great fear is little (without existence)
: because it is untrue. |
"
210,"Verse 41] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 167

What is the import of calling equanimity or the feeling of
disinterestedness ‘a little.’ The feeling of disinterestedness: is
great, but we understand and experience it a little, so it has been
called a little. In fact our understanding is a little, equanimity is
not a little. Our view has not grasped it fully, so there is defect
in our view, not in equanimity. Similarly we have valued the
unreal more, it does not mean that the unreal is great but value
accorded by us is great. Therefore if we value the real more,
the real will become great viz., its value will be realized and
if we don’t value the unreal, the unreal will become a little.
In fact the unreal may be great or a little; it has no existence
‘nasato vidyate bhavah’ and the real may be great or a little, its
existence is ever present—‘na bhavo vidyate satah’. Therefore
in Upanisads the Supreme Soul has been called smaller than a
molecule and the biggest of all—‘anoraniyan mahato mahiyan’
(Katha. 1/2/20, Svetasvatara 3/20).

vyavasayatmika buddhirekeha kurunandana

bahusakha hyanantasca buddhayo'vyavasayinam

O Joy of the Kurus, in this blessed path, the intellect is
determinate and concentrated, whereas the intellect of the
undecided (infirm), is scattered in many directions, and is
endlessly diverse. 41
Comment:— :

'Vyavasayatmika buddhirekeha kurunandana'—To a seeker
of God-realization, the intellect is determinate and single-pointed
viz., he has only one decision and that is to attain equanimity,
"
211,"168 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
in the form of God-realization. Attachment to the world, is the
main obstacle to this attainment of equanimity, and that can be
removed, through determinate intellect.

Why is determinate intellect one? The reason is, that in
it there is renunciation of desire, for worldly objects etc. This
renunciation of desire is singular, whether it pertains to wealth
and riches or honour and praise. But, there are objects of different
types and a person wants to acquire these. Just as, there are
different kinds of objects, such as different kinds of sweets, in
the same way, there are endless desires for acquiring numerous
objects of various types in various ways. Therefore, a desirous
person cannot have one intellect.

In the Discipline of Action (in this verse), and in the
Discipline of Devotion (in 9/30), there is mention of intellect,
which is determinate and single-pointed, but it is not so, in the
Discipline of Knowledge. The reason is, that in the Discipline
of Knowledge, one comes to know the self first, and then his
intellect becomes determinate and pointed, while in the Discipline
of Action, as well as Devotion, it is the determinate intellect
which comes first and then it is followed by self-realization.
Therefore, in the Discipline of Knowledge there is importance
of knowledge, while in the Disciplines of Devotion and Action,
there is importance of a single-minded pursuit.

'‘Bahusakha hyanantasca buddhayo'vyavasayinam— he infirm
in mind being desire-ridden, clings to pleasure and prosperity,
and so the intellect of such persons, grow endlessly. For example,
they may have a desire to get a son, the means adopted for
the fulfilment of other desire, such as medicine, incantation, :
oblation and blessings of a saint etc., are branches of the same
desire. Similarly, a man wants to get money of this is one desire
(intellect) and to get it through business, service, theft, robbery,
cheating etc., are many branches, of that intellect. Such a man,
with endless desires, having many branches cannot even take
"
212,"Verse 42-43] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 169
decision about God-realization.

Appendix—The real aim is only one. Unless a man has
a singular aim, he has endless aims and there are numerous
branches of each aim. He has endless desires and the means for
the fulfilment of each desire are also many.

But the fact is, that a man himself is a fragment of God
and thus, is eternal while desires are fleeting and these increase
and decrease. The self and desire, are totally distinct. But desire-
"
213,"170 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
ridden people, never realize this distinction and it is only out of
delusion that they identify themselves with desire.

'Svargapara'—They look upon heaven and its pleasure, as
their supreme goal and all their efforts are directed towards that
base end. Here the term ‘Svargapara’, refers to such men, who
have faith and belief in heaven etc., as described, in the Vedas
and scriptures. 7 |

""Vedavadarataéh partha nanyadastiti vadinah'—~-They are
interested in the Vedas, only for the sake of the ritualistic
contents, which deal with earthly and heavenly pleasure. The
aim of their life, is to enjoy celestial pleasure here, and hereafter,

| rather than to attain God-realization, or emancipation. _

'Yamimam puspit4mh vacarh pravadantyavipascitah—They
cannot discriminate between, the real and the unreal, the perishable
and the imperishable. Such unwise persons utter flowery words
of the Vedas, which describe and recommend various acts, for
the attainment of pleasure and prosperity.

Here, the word ‘puspitam' has been used to show that such
speech is just flowery with an attractive appearance, without
bearing any permanent fruit. Satisfaction, comes out of fruit
only, not from flowers and leaves.

'Janmakarmaphalapradam'—That flowery way instead of
giving any permanent and eternal fruit, gives fruit which
prolongs the wheel of birth. In language flowery importance
is attached to pleasure, and attachment to pleasure is the
cause of birth (Gita 13/21).

'Kriyavisesabahulam bhogaisvaryagatim prati'—That, flowery
utterance deals with a number of rituals for the attainment of
pleasure and prosperity. In these rituals there is abundance of
different kinds of rites, involving various methods, actions,

' objects and much strenuous physical labour (Gita 13/21).

'Bhogaisvaryaprasaktanam'—Pleasures of five senses—sound,

touch, colour, taste, smell, comfort to the body, and desire

for respect and praise are 'bhoga', (the worldly enjoyments).

Accumulation of money and material to enjoy those worldly

pleasure, is called 'aiSvarya’ (prosperity). Those who cling to

pleasure and prosperity, are called 'Bhogaisvaryaprasaktanam.’

Such people are called demoniacal* (asura). In sarnskrta 'asu' stands

for life-breath and he who wants to maintain life-breath is an 'asura’.
'Vyavasayatmika buddhih samadhau na _ vidhiyate'—Such

people, who instinctively cling to pleasure and prosperity
cannot attain the determinate intellect to realize God, because
their intellect has become impure. Similarly, the people who
have pride for their being learned, by acquiring the worldly
arts or science or knowledge etc., cannot attain the determinate
intellect, (decision), to realize God. |
All-gracious God, by His grace has bestowed discrimination
* The people possessing the mode of passion who are being described here
have been called people possessing demoniacal traits in the sixteenth chapter by
the Lord (16/11, 16/16).

upon human beings, so that they may attain God or salvation. But
human beings giving a cold shoulder to this discrimination cling
to pleasure like birds and animals. They forget that enjoyment
| of pleasure is not the goal of human life, but its supreme object
| is the attainment of perfection, and all the circumstances, whether
favourable or unfavourable, they are placed in, are means to
attain perfection (God-realization). So they cannot have the sole
desire for God-realization.

The fact is that worldly pleasures and objects are not a real
obstacles to God-realization, but attachment to these, is the main
hindrance. So long as, this attachment continues, not to talk of
God-realization the people cannot even make up their minds to
attain God, because their minds are drawn away, by worldly
pleasure and prosperity etc. :

Appendix—If there is any obstacle to the attainment of
salvation, it is the desire for pleasures and prosperity (accumulation
of wealth). As an ensnared fish can’t move ahead, similarly a
man, entangled in pleasures and prosperity, can’t move ahead
towards God. Not only this but the man attached to pleasures
and prosperity, can’t even have the determinate intellect to
realize God.

He who regards the world as true, to him Karmayoga will
quickly lead to Self-realization. A Karmayogi serves the world

| by discharging his duty viz., he does every action for the welfare
of others in a disinterested manner. He feels happy with the
happiness of others and is sad (moved) with the sadness of others.
By feeling happy seeing others happy, his desire for pleasure is
wiped out and by being moved at the sufferings of others, his
desire for prosperity (accumulation) is wiped out.*

the desire for pleasure and prosperity otherwise the service is fake. But if the

O Arjuna, the Vedas deal with the three Gunas (attributes)
and their evolutes. Be free from those attributes, rise above the
polarity of opposites, remain balanced, be unconcerned about the
meeting of wants and preservation, of what has been already
attained and get established in the self. 45 , |
Comment:— |

'Traigunyavisaya veda—Here, the reference, is to the ritualistic
portions of the Vedas, which deal with the three gunas (attributes)
and their evolutes, in the form of worldly and heavenly enjoyment.
The purpose is not to censure the Vedas, but to glorify the selfless
spirit. In reference to a diamond a piece of glass is compared
the aim is to eulogize the diamond, rather than to censure glass.
The Vedas do not only deal with means to satisfy desires of
the worldly minded people, but they also contain sublime and
elevating ideas on God and the means to realize Him.

'Nistraigunyo bhavarjuna’—-O Arjuna, be free from the
evolutes of these attributes viz., be free from worldly enjoyment, :
as well as, means of attaining such enjoyment.

‘Nirdvandvah'—For a striver to transcend the worldly
enjoyment, it is inevitable to be free from the pairs of
opposites such as attachment and aversion etc., because these
"
217,"174 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
are his real enemies and are the stumbling block, in his
spiritual progress (Gita 3/34).* . | |

Here, Lord Krsna orders Arjuna to rise above the pairs of
opposites, because through their deluding nature, human beings are
enveloped in utter ignorance (Gita 7/27). When a striver gets rid of

- this delusion, he can worship Him with a firm resolve (Gita 7/28).
By transcending these pairs of opposites, he is easily freed from
bondage (5/3), one becomes undeluded (15/5) and he is not bound
(4/22). So the Lord, wants him to be free from the pairs of opposites.

Another aspect is that if a person develops attachment for
one person or a thing, he is sure to develop aversion to other
persons or things. By having such attachment to the world, an
aspirant turns indifferent to God. This indifference is a sort of
aversion to God. But if one develops. true devotion to God,
without having any attachment or aversion to the world, he
develops total disinclination for it. .

This total disinclination has three stages. In the first stage,
the aspirant has no hatred for unfavourable circumstances but
there is 'Upeksa (neglect), in the second stage, there is 'Udasinata’ _
(unconcernedness), while in the third stage, there is total
disinclination. In the last stage, (total disinclination), attachment
and aversion, are totally. wiped out. If this process is considered
minutely, we find that in 'Upeksa’ there remain impressions of
attachment and aversion, in 'Udasinata' the feelings of attachment
and aversion remain, while in total disinclination there are neither

impressions nor feelings of attachment and aversion. In this state,
_ attachment and aversion are totally wiped out.
'Nityasattvasthah'—The advice is to rise above the pairs
of opposites and to get established in the omnipresent and
everlasting God. , :
- ¥* 'Dyandva' means having opposite feelings for something as the feelings
of attachment-and aversion, pleasure and pain etc., for the world. This misleads
an aspirant to bondage.
"
218,"Verse 46] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 175

'Niryogaksema*'—Do not have the desire even for the provision
of the means required (Yoga) and the preservation of what has
already been attained, because I provide for and preserve all
for those who have exclusive devotion for meT (Gita 9/22).

'‘Atmavan'—Having the aim of God-realization, get
established in the self (Eternal existence or God).

Appendix—‘Nirdvandvah’—In fact the discrimination between
the insentient-sentient, real-unreal, eternal-transitory, perishable-
imperishable etc., is also a pair of opposites. The desire for gain
and security is also a duality. Because of duality “All is God’—this
reality is not realized. The reason is when all is God, then how
can duality between the sentient (self) and the insentient (Matter)
subsist? Therefore the Lord has declared Himself both immortality
as well as death, and ‘Sat’ as well as “Asat’ (unreal)}—‘amrtarh
caiva mrtyusca sadasaccahamarjuna’ (Gita 9/19).

_ { Though here it is the context of the Discipline of Disinterested Action, yet
it seems proper to take it as the Discipline of Devotion because Lord Krsna, time
and again, orders Arjuna to be His devotee and He also accepts him as His devotee
in 4/3. He also takes the responsibility of provision and protection (9/22).
"
219,"176 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter2
Comment:— | . .

'Yavanartha udapane sarvatah samplutodake'—A . small
reservoir of water is useful, in a place where there is no other
source of water. But nobody ever, pays any attention to such a
reservoir of water where there is a big reservoir of pure water.
Moreover that such a small reservoir of water becomes dirty and
impure and cannot be used for drinking purpose, after washing
and bathing in it. But water from a large stream remains clean
and pure, even after washing and bathing in it.

'Tavansarvesu. vedesu. brahmanasya  vijanatah'—Likewise
oblations, charities, penances and pilgrimages etc., mentioned in

| the Vedas, are of use to those who are ignorant. But these become
meaningless to the illumined souls who have realized God. The
: same kind of comparison has been made, in the seventieth verse,
that the emancipated souls are like sea, as several rivers fall into
it but its magnitude remains the same, similarly the illumined
souls remain undisturbed though several kinds of pleasure and
enjoyment merge into them.

A great soul who possesses knowledge of the Lord, the Vedas
and the scriptures is called 'Brahmanasya vijanatah.'

By using the term 'tavan', Lord Krsna means to say that
the great soul after realizing God transcends the three attributes
(modes), rises above the pairs of opposites viz., becomes free
from attachment and aversion, gets established in the self and
remains unconcerned about provision and preservation. He always
remains devoted to God.

Appendix—There is no end of worldly pleasures. There are
endless universes and there are endless pleasures in them. But if
they are renounced and one becomes detached from them, they
come to an end. Similarly there are endless desires. But if they are
renounced, they come to an end and the man becomes desireless.

Your right is only to perform your duty, but never to claim :
its fruit. Do not be the cause of the fruit of action nor let your
attachment be for inaction. 47 7
Comment:— : :

'Karmanyevadhikaraste'—Your right is to perform your
duty, you are free in it, because no other bodies as those of
animals and birds etc., are free to perform new actions. Only
human beings are eligible to perform new actions. The gods can
perform new actions and can bestow money and material upon
human beings, according to the ordinance of the Lord but they
are so steeped in enjoyment, that it is not possible for them to
perform new actions. They are destined only to reap the fruit
of their meritorious deeds. The creatures in hell also cannot
perform new actions as they suffer the fruits of their actions.
God has bestowed this human birth, the very last of all births
so that by performing new actions in the form of selfless service
to others, a person may achieve salvation and be freed from the
bondage of the cycle of birth and death. If he remains engaged
in selfish actions, these will result in bondage. In case he is
given to indolence and heedlessness, he will follow a cycle of
birth and death. Therefore, the Lord advises human beings, to |
render selfless services for common good.

The term 'Karmani' has been used ‘in singular number, to
emphasize the fact that though man has to perform several
"
221,"178 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
duties in his life, he can perform only: one at a particular time.
Arjuna, belonging to the warrior class, has several duties, such
as fighting, generosity and bravery etc., but presently he could
perform only one of these—to wage the war. |
In the births of others 1.e., those of birds, animals, insects
and even gods, the creatures can reap the fruits of their actions
but cannot perform new actions. However there are two things
about human life viz., reaping the fruits of deeds of earlier
lives, and secondly performing new ones. God has bestowed
upon man this human body, so that by performing new virtuous
actions without having a desire for their fruits, he may attain
God-realization or salvation. As far as the fruit of his previous
actions is concemed, it may come in the form of favourable
and unfavourable circumstances. He cannot change those
circumstances, but can make proper use of these and these can
lead him to salvation, if he uses these properly.
An important fact, which needs attention, is that favourable
: or unfavourable circumstances cannot make a man happy or sad.
It is merely his ignorance, which makes him happy or sad as
he identifies himself with those circumstances and becomes the
experiencer of happiness or sadness. If he gives a serious thought,
he will come to know that the external circumstances cannot make
his internal self, either happy or sad. He should make proper
use of the favourable circumstances by serving others and of the
undesirable ones, by renouncing the desire to enjoy pleasure.
In unfavourable circumstances, a man should not be perturbed
but should think that the sins committed to get pleasure, are
perishing in the form of unfavourable circumstances and this thought
is a kind of repentance for the sins committed. Secondly, it is a
fore-warning to us that we shall have to face adverse consequences
if we commit sins again. So, we should perform actions for
"
222,"Verse 47] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 179
the welfare of all creatures, rather than for our own pleasure. |

For insects, birds and animals etc., the fruit of past actions
and also the present actions are only to work out their destinies.
But in case of human beings the fruit of past actions as aiso the
present activities, are the means for their salvation.

""Ma phalesu kadacana'—You cannot claim the fruit of action, —
because you are not free in getting it, which is dispensed by the
Lord. If you perform actions with a desire for fruits, you will
get into bondage (Gita 5/12). It is the desire for fruit which
makes a person an agent for actions. With the passing away of
desire, a sense of doership is gone. Obliteration of the sense of

: doership, does not lead a man to’ bondage. It means that a man
is much more entangled in desires.* : Oo

Secondly, all actions are performed with the help of worldly
objects and persons. So it is dishonest, to desire the fruit of those
actions, for only one's own self. : | | |

The desire for fruit of actions is not beneficial for human
beings. ‘Never lay claim to its fruit'—this expression proves that
it is upto a man whether he lays claim to the fruit of an action
or not. He is free in this respect. The term ‘Phalesu' has been
used in the plural, because a man by performing an action desires
several fruits such as riches, respect and reputation etc. —

The means to be free, from the desire for fruits of actions are
as follows—(i) Desire causes a feeling of lacking something. Its
fulfilment makes one a slave. Its non-fulfilment causes suffering.
The pleasure derived out of fulfilment of desire, gives birth to
new desires and a man goes on getting interested in performing
new actions, in order to reap their fruit. By understanding this
fact in the right perspective, a man becomes free from the desire
for the fruit of action. — oS

_* Actually God-realization does not depend on actions but on feelings and _
knowledge because He is ever attained. It 1s the desire for fruits which is an
obstacle to God-realization.
"
223,"180 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2

(ii) Actions have a beginning and an end, these are not
eternal. So, how can their fruits be eternal? But the self is eternal.
How can the eternal get any benefit from the perishable? By
understanding this fact, one becomes detached from the world
and attains God-realization. :

In order to be free from the desire for fruits of actions, an
aspirant should have discrimination as well as feelings to serve
others. Discrimination will be helpful to an aspirant in renouncing
his comforts, while the feelings of service to others, will enable
him to do good to others. By doing so a striver can follow the
Discipline of Disinterested Action, in the right sense.

""Ma karmaphalaheturbhih'—Let you not be responsible for

| the fruits of action. It means, that you should not have the least
attachment for the body, senses, mind and intellect etc., because
attachment for these will make you responsible for the fruit of
action. In the eleventh verse of the fifth chapter also, Lord Krsna
by using the term ‘Kevalaih’ (only) wants to say that the follower
of the Discipline of Disinterested Action, should abandon feeling
of mineness for the body, mind, intellect and senses.

If a striver becomes the agent (doer) of a virtuous action,
even without having a desire for its fruit, he is held responsible
for the fruit of the action, because by doing so he has accepted
his affinity for the mind, intellect and senses etc., which are
unreal. Actually, we have no affinity with them, they have their
affinity with the world. When anybody else performs action for
the good of others, we do not accept our affinity for the action
and its fruit and so are not held responsible. We should adopt
the same attitude in the case of our own actions also, so that we
may not be held responsible for the fruit of actions.

'Ma te sango'stvakarmani'—Let your attachment not be to
inaction, because by leaning towards inaction, you will become
lazy and idle, and like the desire for fruit it will also mislead you
to bondage. The reason is that, indolence and prolonged sleep
"
224,"Verse 47] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 181
etc., also give pleasure viz., Tamasika joy, (Gital8/39) which
misleads either to the lower births of insects, birds and beasts
etc., or to infernal regions (Gita 14/18). It means that, attachment
misleads to bondage and is the cause of birth in good and evil
wombs (Gita 13/21).

- You should not be attached to inaction by thinking that it
will lead you to progress, here and hereafter, because the real
essence is beyond action or imaction. :

In this verse, the Lord means to say that a striver should
remain detached from objects, men, action, incidents, circumstances
and physical, subtle, causal bodies etc., without having the least

| affinity for them. | 7

In this verse there are four points which need attention—{i)
Your right is to perform your duty (action) only. (ii) Never lay
claim to its fruit. (11) Do not be the cause of the fruit of action.
(iv) Let your attachment be not to inaction. Out of these four
points, the first and the fourth, have the same theme as both
of these lay emphasis on the performance of duty or action.
Similarly, the second and the third points have the same theme,
as in both of these it is mentioned, that you should not desire
or be the cause of the fruit of action. |

It means that, by leaning towards inaction you will have
affinity to tamasika temperament, such as idleness and laziness.
By having attachment for action and its fruit you will have affinity
for rajasika temperament. But when a striver is free from laziness,
idleness, actions, fruit of actions, etc., he gets the joy born of
knowledge and light and having attachment for it, he has affinity ,
to sattvika temperament. Affinity with these is the cause of birth
and death. Therefore, a striver should not have attachment for
either of them. Doing one's duty without having any attachment
to them, is called the Discipline of Disinterested Action.

Appendix—One is the division of actions and one is the
division of fruit (result). A man’s right is in the division of
"
225,"—— 182 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
actions (performance of duty), not in the division of fruit. The
reason is that performance of duty is under the control of a
man while awarding the result of past actions ts ordained by
destiny viz., “Prarabdha’. If we perceive from the view-point
of Karmayoga whatever material (thing, ability and power) we
have obtained, that is ‘Prarabdha’ and their proper use viz., by
assuming them not as ours or for us, but by assuming them as
others’ and for them, and rendering service with them to others
is ‘Purusartha’. |

The important fact about Karmayoga is—protection of the
rights of others by performing one’s duty and renouncing the
fruit of action viz., renouncing one’s right. By protecting the
right of others, old attachment is wiped out and by renouncing
one’s own right, new attachment is not born. Thus when old
attachment is wiped out and new attachment is not born, a man
becomes ‘vitaraga’ (free from attachment). By becoming ‘vitaraga’
one realizes the self. The reason is in attaining Self-realization,
attachment to the unreal things is the only obstacle—

rago lmgamabodhasya cittavyayama bhimisu |
kutah Sadvalata tasya yasyagnih kotare tarah

It means that attachment (attraction) of the mind to objects,
persons and actions is the main sign (mark) of ignorance. As
when the hollow of a tree catches fire, it does not remain green

| any more but it is dried up, similarly he who has caught fire in
the form of attachment, can’t attain peace.

Comment:—
‘Sangam tyaktva'—You can become indifferent, only if you :

have no attachment for actions, their fruits; place, time, incidents, |

circumstances, bodies and minds etc., which belong to matter, _
because without being indifferent to actions, these cannot lead }
you to salvation. :

'Siddhyasiddhyoh samo bhiitva'—Renunciation of attachment |
will result in evenness of mind. A man should be even-minded,

in favourable and unfavourable circumstances, in honour and |

dishonour, and in praise and reproach.* -
A follower of the Discipline of Disinterested Action, should be

so even-minded while performing actions, that he should not bother

about their accomplishment or non-accomplishment, for getting

the fruit or not, for getting salvation or not. He should remain

devoted to his duty. If an aspirant has not realized detachment

and equanimity, he should aim at evenness of mind. By having

this approach, a striver will attain equanimity finally, which will

lead to God-realization or Self-realization (2/53).

""Yogasthah kuru karmani'—Lord Krsna says, that the essence

of true Yoga lies in even-mindedness, in success, as well as,

failure. The person who keeps the mind ever in the poised state
* While explaining this verse Sri Sankaracarya writes—O Dhanajijaya,

being established in Yoga perform actions only for God without even having the

desire to please Him. Knowledge gained by purification of mind as a result of

the desireless (without the desire for fruits) actions is called 'Siddhi’ (Success) |

and whatever is contrary to it (lack of knowledge) is ‘Asiddhi’ (Failure). Perform

actions being even-minded amidst success or failure. This evenness of mind or

equanimity is called ""Yoga’. ,
"
227,"184 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
is called steadfast in Yoga- The sameness of mind should remain
intact from the beginning of an action, to its end. It should not
be. a temporary phase, otherwise the propensities of attraction
and repulsion, will go on coming up. We should never allow
such propensities to develop.

‘Samatvarh yoga ucyate'—Yoga is, nothing but equanimity
Le., equanimity is the embodiment of Lord Himself. Further,
in the nineteenth verse of the fifth chapter, Lord Krsna says,
*“Those whose mind is established in equanimity, have conquered
the mortal plane, because Brahma (the Absolute) is flawless and
equanimous, hence they are established in the Eternal.” «5

| Here, Yoga has been defined as equanimity, while in the
twenty-third verse of the sixth chapter, it will be defined as,
the state which is free from the contact of pain. Actually, both
the definitions are the same. When a man suffers from ring-
worm or itching eczema, he gets satisfaction by scratching it.
The pleasure of itching, is followed by the painful sensation of
burning. Being the result of a disease both these sensations are
really painful. Similarly, the pleasure and pain received from
attachment to the world, are equally painful. Therefore, Yoga
can either be defined as the state, free from the contact of pain
viz., free from pleasure and pain or equanimity in pleasure and
pain; both are the same. 7
_ Jt means that through all actions performed by physical, subtle
and causal bodies should render service to the world, without
having any selfish motive. This alone will lead to equanimity.

Intellect is of two kinds—indeterminate and determinate.
The intellect of those whose aim is to enjoy worldly pleasure
and prosperity, is indeterminate (Gita 2/44) while the intellect
of those whose aim is equanimity and salvation is determinate.
Indeterminate intellects are endlessly diverse, while the determinate
"
228,"Verse 48] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 185
one, is single. Those whose intellects are endlessly diverse, are
themselves undecided (Gita 2/41) and are worldly. But those
whose intellect is single, have rightly resolved (Gita 9/30) and
they are strivers.

Equanimity is of two kinds—of the mind and of the self.
To remain even, in favourable or unfavourable circumstances,
without having any attachment or aversion, is equanimity of the
mind, while equanimity of the self is union with God (2/53).

There is a distinction between the worldly people and
strivers. The goal of the worldly people, is to enjoy pleasure
and prosperity and their intellects are not determinate but are

| scattered in many directions and are endlessly diverse. On the

other hand, the striver's intellects are determinate and the strivers
in their practical life maintain equanimity in success and failure, :
profit and loss, and favourable and unfavourable circumstances,
without having attachment and aversion. Such strivers conquer
the mortal plane and are established in the Eternal (Gita 5/19).

Appendix—In Patanjala Yogadarsana the control of the
mind has been called ‘yoga’—‘yogascittavrtti nirodhah’ (1/2).
As a result of this yoga the seer rests in the self—‘tada drastuh

what has been called the result of yoga, the Gita declares
the same as ‘yoga’—‘samatvarh yoga ucyate’; ‘tarh vidyad
duhkhasarhyogaviyogam yogasamjnitam’ (Gita 6/23). It means
that the Gita declares that when a man (self) is totally detached
from the mind and naturally rests in the self, that state is called
‘yoga’. By getting established in this yoga (equanimity), there
is no deviation from it; therefore it is also called ‘Nityayoga’
(eternal union). When the mind is controlled ‘Nirvikalpa avastha’
(state of cessation of thoughts) ensues. But when by equanimity
a man rests in the Self that 1s ‘Nirvikalpa bodha’ (knowledge of
Truth) or ‘sahajavastha’ (Self-realization). ‘Nirvikalpa bodha’ is
not a state but it transcends all states, it is their illuminator and is
"
229,"186 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter2
the result of all yoga-disciplines. The states are both ‘nirvikalpa’
: (without distraction) and ‘savikalpa’ (with distraction) but “bodha’
| is only ‘nirvikalpa’. Thus the yoga of the Gita is more remarkable

| than that of Patafijala yogadarSana.
The person who is not of ‘midha’ (deluded) and ‘ksipta’
/ (volatile) inclination but is of ‘viksipta’ (sometimes constant,
7 sometimes volatile) inclination is eligible (qualified) for yoga of
Pataiijala Yogadarsana. But all the persons who want to attain
| God are eligible for the yoga of the Gita (God-realization). Not
- only this but the person who, instead of attaching importance to
| pleasure and prosperity, attaches importance to this yoga—such
- a seeker of the yoga (equanimity) also transcends the fruit of
Vedic rituals performed with some motive—‘jijfasurapi yogasya

| §abdabrahmativartate’ (Gita 6/44).

_ * Link:— In the next verse, Lord Krsna explains the superiority
of equanimity (which has been described from the thirty-ninth
verse to the forty-eighth verse) to a motivated action viz., action
with a selfish motive.

Comment:—
'Direna hyavaram karma buddhiyogat—Action with a selfish
motive is, far inferior to that performed with equanimity of
mind. Actions have a beginning and an end and connection with
"
230,"Verse 49] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 187
their fruits, is also temporary. We get associated and dissociated
with them. But Yoga (equanimity) is eternal, it never deserts us,
it suffers no change. Therefore, selfish action is much inferior
to equanimity.

Action without equanimity, mislead to pain, as well as to the
cycle of birth and death, because they have no power to lead one
to salvation. Equanimity is the ability to neutralize actions. If there
is nO equanimity, one will develop one's egoism and attachment,
to the body. This egoism and attachment are beastly. In the
Bhagavata sage Sukadeva says to king Pariksit, 'O king, renounce
this beastly nature which is causing fear of death in you’ (12/5/2).

: 'Diirena'—As light is the contrary of darkness, an action
performed with equanimity of mind, is contrary to the action
performed with a selfish motive. An action performed with
equanimity leads to God-realization, while motivated actions
mislead to the wheel of birth and death. :

‘Buddhau Saranamanviccha'— Seek refuge in this evenness
of mind viz., remain established in this evenness of mind, which
will enable you to realize yourself. oo

'Krpanah phalahetavah'—It is very lowly to crave for fruit
of action. To accept one's affinity for actions, fmiits of actions
and bodies etc., means, to crave for fruit of action. Therefore,
Lord Krsna, in the forty-seventh verse, exhorts Arjuna not to
have the fruit of action, as his object. |

The eternal truth is different from perishable action and the
fruit of action. What can be more ignoble than this, that the
eternal should be subservient to the perishable fruit of action?

Appendix—An action with a selfish motive is far inferior
to yoga (equanimity) viz., it does not lead to salvation. As a
molecule is far smaller than a mountain viz., a molecule can’t
be compared with a mountain, similarly an action with a selfish
motive is far inferior to yoga viz., an action can’t be compared
with yoga. Yoga (equanimity) is skill in action—‘yogah karmasu
"
231,"188 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2

- kauSalam’ (Gita 2/50). Therefore without yoga, an action is of
a very low order, is worthless and is an obstacle—‘karmana
badhyate jantuh’. .

In Karmayoga ‘Karma’ is Karana Sapeksa (dependent on
external and internal organs) but ‘yoga’ is Karana Nirapeksa
(independent of external and internal organs). Yoga is not
attained by actions but is attained by service and renunciation.
Therefore Karmayoga is not Karma (action). Karmayoga is
Karana Nirapeksa viz., discrimination predominating discipline.
If there 1s no predominance of service and renunciation, it will
be Karma, not Karmayoga (Discipline of Action) at all.
~ - Kquanimity leads to God-realization, but actions done with an
interested motive lead to-the cycle of birth and death. Therefore

| a striver should depend on equanimity, should remain established
in equanimity. By being established in equanimity, he will not
remain destitute and nothing will remain to be done, to be known
and to be attained by him. But he, who works with an interested
motive (for him), ever remains destitute and bound.

In the Gita three terms have been used for Karmayoga—Buddhi,
yoga and Buddhiyoga. In Karmayoga, there is no predominance
of action (Karma) but there is predominance of ‘yoga’. Yoga,
Buddhi and Buddhiyoga—the three are synonyms. In Karmayoga
because of the predominance of determinate intellect, it is called
‘Buddhi’ and because of the predominance 6f renunciation by
discrimination, it is called ‘yoga’ or ‘buddhiyoga’. |

In ‘Dhyanayoga’ (Discipline of Meditation) there is
predominance of concentration of ‘mind’, while in Karmayoga
there is predominance of ‘intellect’. While tryng to control the
mind, serenity and fickleness linger for a long time because in It
a striver wants to withdraw the mind from the world and wants
to concentrate it on God. While withdrawing the mind from
the world, in its conception the existence of the world persists.
This is a rule that so long as there is assumption of any other
"
232,"Verse 50] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 189
entity except God, the mind can’t be fully controlled. Therefore
upto the stage of trance also there are two states—trance and
deviation from trance (relapse). But in Karmayoga because of the
predominance of intellect, there is prominence of discrimination.
While applying discrimination both the real and the unreal remain.
A karmayogi applies the unreal things for the service of others
by regarding those things as the material for the service. By
such conception the attachment for the unreal is quickly and
easily renounced. _

The mind is not continuously concentrated but it is concentrated
at times and in loneliness. But determinate intellect viz., a single
pointed determination of the intellect always remains steadfast.

equanimity of mind.

buddhiyukto jahatiha $oubhe — sukrtaduskrte

tasmadyogaya yujyasva yogah karmasu kauSalam

Endowed with equanimity, one frees the self in this life from
good (virtue) and evil (vice) alike; therefore, devote yourself to
this Yoga of equanimity; skill in action lies in (the practice of
this) Yoga. 50
Comment:— — |

""Buddhiyukto jahattha ubhe sukrtaduskrte'—A person,
endowed with equanimity, becomes free from virtue and vice 7
like omnipresent God (Gita 2/38).

In the state of equanimity, a man while living in the world
detaches himself from the world, and remains untouched by
virtues and sins, as a lotus leaf by water.

Man himself is sentient and is free from virtue and sin,
"
233,"190 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
but by identifying himself with the unreal body etc., sins and

_ virtues accrue. If he does not identify himself with the unreal,
he will remain untouched by virtues and sins, and unconnected
with them like the sky. | :

'Tasmadyogaya yujyasva'—Therefore, devote yourself to the
Yoga of. equanimity, viz., remain established continuously in
equanimity. You cannot attain that equanimity, so long as you
have attachment and aversion. You are the knower of pleasure and
pain. It means, that you are different from them and you are as
a onlooker, who remains equanimous. So realize that equanimity.

""Yogah karmasu kausalam'—Skill in action lies in the

| practice of this Yoga. Equanimity, in success and failure, is
_ skill in action.

In this verse, Lord Krsna has not defined Yoga, but He has
explained the importance of Yoga. (equanimity). If we interpret
it as, 'skill in action is Yoga’, it means, that the action of a thief
carried out skilfully, will also be called Yoga. Therefore, this
interpretation does not seem proper. Some people may define
Yoga ‘skill in action approved by the scriptures.’ But, by doing
so the people will be bound by the fruits of action and will not
be able to attain equanimity. Therefore, it is proper to interpret,
equanimity in action as skill or wisdom. The reason is, that he
who remains even-minded while performing actions, is not bound
by such actions and their fruit.

Secondly, in the first part of this verse, as well as in the
previous two verses there is the reference of Yoga (Equanimity) __
rather than skill. So this interpretation seems to be reasonable.

Appendix—lIf we reflect upon the expression ‘yogah karmasu
kauSalam’, it may have two meanings—

(i) ‘karmasu kaugalam yogah’—skill in actions is yoga.

(ii) ‘karmasu yogah kausalam’—In action yoga is skill.

| If we interpret it in the first way that skill in actions is
"
234,"Verse 50] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 191
yoga, then the actions of a thief or a swindler carried out very
skilfully, will be called “Yoga’. This interpretation is not proper
and moreover here is not the topic of forbidden actions. If we
regard only virtuous actions to be carried out skilfully as ‘Yoga’,
then the man will be bound being attached to the fruit of those
virtuous actions—‘phale sakto nibadhyate’ (Gita 5/12). Therefore
he will not attain equanimity and his sufferings will not perish.

In the scriptures it is menttoned——‘karmana badhyate jantuh’
v1Z., a man is bound by actions. Therefore the actions which
naturally lead him to bondage, may lead him to salvation—this
is indeed skill in actions. Salvation is attained by ‘yoga’
(equanimity), rather than by skill in actions. Yoga (equanimity)
has neither its beginning nor end. But even the most virtuous
actions begin and end and there is union and disunion of their
fruit also. How will a person attain salvation by what begins
and ends and of which there is union and disunion? How will
the imperishable be attained by the perishable? Equanimity is
the form of God—‘nirdosarh hi samarh brahma’ (Gitd 5/19).
Therefore ‘yoga’ is important, not actions.

If the first interpretation is regarded as correct, even then
within ‘skill’, equanimity or feeling of disinterest will have
to be accepted. If skill in actions is yoga, then what is skill?
While answering this question we’ ll have to say that only ‘Yoga’
(equanimity) is skill. In such a situation why should we not
accept the direct meaning that yoga (equanimity) in actions is
skill. When in the expression ‘yogah karmasu kaugalam’ the
term ‘yoga’ has certainly been used, then there is no need of
interpreting the word ‘KuSalata’ (skill) as yoga.

If we reflect upon this topic, there is the reference of ‘Yoga’
(equanimity) rather than ‘skill in actions’. The Lord by declaring
‘samatvarh yoga ucyate’ has also defined ‘yoga’. Therefore in
this reference ‘yoga’ is ‘vidheya’ (predicate), ‘skill in actions’ is
not predicate. ‘Yoga’ (equanimity) is skill in action viz., while
"
235,"192 _ SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
doing actions there should be even-mindedness, there should not
be any attachment or aversion—this is skill in actions. Therefore
‘yogah karmasu kauSalarn’—this is not the definition of Yoga,
but it is the glory of ‘Yoga’.

In the first half of this verse (fiftieth) the Lord has declared
that a person endowed with equanimity becomes free from virtue
and vice (sin). If he is freed from virtue and sin, then which
action will be done with skill? Therefore freedom from virtue
and sin does not mean that he does not do any action because
no one under any circumstances can remain even for a moment
without undertaking action (Gita 3/5). So here freedom from

| virtue and sin means—freedom from their fruit. In the fifty-first
verse also the Lord has mentioned the renunciation of the fruit
of action by the expression ‘phalarh tyaktva’.

In the Gita the term ‘KuSala’ has also been used in the tenth
verse of the eighteenth chapter. There within ‘akugala karma’
all the actions performed with an interested motive and actions
forbidden by the scriptures, have been included while within
‘kuSala karma’ all the actions done with disinterested motive and
actions sanctioned by the scriptures, have been included. There
is a beginning and there is an end of ‘Akugala’ and ‘Kuéala’
actions but there is no beginning or end of ‘Yoga’. Attachment
and aversion bind a man; agreeable and disagreeable actions
don’t bind him. Therefore the actions, which are performed
by being attached to them, may be very virtuous, will lead to
bondage because by those actions even if the abode of Brahma
is attained, one has to return (Gita 8/16). Therefore the. man,
who does not shun the disagreeable actions with aversion and
does not perform the virtuous actions with attachment, is indeed
a man of true renunciation, is intelligent, is free from doubts and
is established in the self (Gita 18/10). , :

The above description proves that the expression ‘yogah
karmasu kauSsalam’ means ‘Yoga (equanimity) in actions
"
236,"Verse 51] - SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 193
is skill’—this should be accepted. The Lord also orders to
perform actions being steadfast in Yoga—‘yogasthah kuru
karmani’ (Gita 2/48). It means that actions are not significant
but ‘Yoga’ (equanimity) is significant. Therefore only ‘Yoga’
(equanimity) in actions is skill.

karmajam buddhiyukta hi phalam tyaktva manisinah
janmabandhavinirmuktah padam gacchantyanamayam

As wise men endowed with equanimity, renounce the fruits of
actions, they also freed from the shackles of births and attain the
blissful supreme state. 51
Comment:—

'Karmajam buddhiyukté hi phalarn tyaktva manisinah'—
Those endowed with equanimity, are really wise. In the tenth
verse of the eighteenth chapter also, it is explained that, the
man who does not hate disagreeable action nor is attached to
an agreeable one, is wise. | | —

An action even without the desire for its fruit will. bring
about fruit. No one can dispense with its fruit. Suppose a farmer
sows seed without a selfish motive, will he not get corn? He
will definitely get corn. In the same way if a person works in
a detached spirit, he will get its fruit. Therefore, renunciation :
of fruit means, renunciation of manifest and latent desires for
fruit and attachment for fruit. All people are free and capable
of renouncing such desires. |

‘Janmabandhavinirmuktah'—The wise aspirants, endowed
with equanimity of mind are freed from the wheel of birth and
"
237,"194 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
death. As in the state of equanimity, they do not in the least,
possess evils, such as attachment and aversion etc., which are the
root cause of rebirth. Thus they become free from the shackles
of birth and death, forever.

‘Padarn gacchantyanamayam'—'Amaya’ means ailment. An
ailment is a blemish. A thing which is free from all sorts of
blemishes is called ‘Anamaya (spotless). Wise people endowed
with equanimity attain the state, which is free from any kind
of blemish. This state has been called eternal state, in the fifth
verse of the fifteenth chapter and ‘everlasting imperishable state’,
in the fifty-sixth verse of the eighteenth chapter.

Though in the Gita (in 14/6) sattva quality (the mode of
goodness) has also been called flawless, yet in fact, the self or
God is flawless because by attaining Him one has not to follow the
wheel of birth and death. Lord Krsna has called Sattva quality also
flawless, because that also helps a man in attaining God-realization.

Self (soul) is immutable while the evolutes of matter
(nature)—body and the world are mutable. When this self
(soul) identifies itself with the mutable body, it itself assumes
taint with mutable nature. But, when it renounces this assumed
identification, it realizes its pure self. This is a blissful supreme
state, free from evil.

In this verse the terms ‘buddhiyukta’ and ‘manisinah’ have
been used in the plural, to express the idea that all those who get
established in equanimity undoubtedly attain the blissful supreme
state, without any exception. It proves. that when a striver has
no affinity to the perishable body and the world, he attains that
state automatically. No effort is required for such a state to be
created, as it always is there. : |

Appendix—Why Yoga (equanimity) in actions is skill—the
Lord explains its reason in this verse by the term ‘hi’ (reason).

The fruit of ‘Sattvika’ (good) actions is pure, the fruit
of ‘Rajasa’ action is pain and the fruit of “Tamasa’ action is
"
238,"Verse 52] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI ' 195
ignorance (Gita 14/16)—a man with equanimity transcends these
three kinds of fruit. The renunciation of the fruit of actions has
two meanings—renouncing the desire for fruit; and not to feel
happy and sad in favourable and unfavourable circumstances
which are the fruits of actions. |
In fact the entire world which is born and perishes is nothing
but the fruit of actions. If the fruit of actions is renounced, no
bondage remains. | | |
The term ‘manisi’ means wise men. According to the preceding
verse performance of actions with equanimity is wisdom—‘sa
buddhimanmanusyesu’ (Gita 4/18).
| ‘Padam gacchantyanamayam’—The term ‘gacchanti’ has
three meanings—(1) To have knowledge, (2) to go, (3) to attain.
Here attainment of the blissful supreme state means—to have
knowledge of being free from the shackles of birth and death
and of the attainment of the natural state, free from all sorts of
blemishes. The reason is that only that is renounced which is
in fact ever renounced and only that is attained who is in fact
ever attained. : |
| This verse proves that ‘Karmayoga’ (Discipline of Action)
is an independent means for salvation or benediction. By
‘Karmayoga’ the renunciation of the world and attainment of
God—both ensue. ,

When your intellect crosses the mire of delusion, you will then
"
239,"196 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
acquire indifference, to what has been heard and what is yet to be
heard, (about enjoyments of this world and the next). 52
Comment:—

'Yada te mohakalilam buddhirvyatitarisyati'—The state
which favours, egoism in this body and attachment for the
body, family, kinsmen and objects, is called delusion. Actually,
there is no egoism and attachment, for the body etc. They are
merely assumed. Pleasure and displeasure, in favourable and
unfavourable circumstances and evils, such as partiality, hatred,
envy and jealousy etc., are a quagmire. When the intellect of a
man gets entangled in this mire of delusion, he is perplexed and
cannot think properly.

| He, himself is sentient, but by accepting his affinity for the
insentient body and things etc., he identifies himself with them.
Thus by closing his eyes to the real goal, he~gets engrossed in
worldly pleasure and prosperity. This is called, entanglement
in the mire of delusion. But the intellect which takes the firm
decision to be free from the worldly pleasures and prosperity
and to attain salvation, is called the ‘Intellect’ transcending the
mire of delusion.

There are two means to cross the swamp of delusion—
discrimination (2/11—30) and selfless service. Acute discrimination
between the real and the unreal, makes one indifferent to the unreal
world, and a keen desire for selfless service for the welfare of
others, enables one to renounce the desire for one's own pleasures.
In the same way as when a disciple for his preceptor, a son for
parents, a servant for his master develop a wish for providing
all sorts of comforts to them, then their desire for comfort goes
away automatically.

The Discipline of Knowledge, is somewhat difficult to
practise, because the desire for pleasure may linger on in it. When
a striver comes across pleasures, he deviates from his spiritual
path and inclines towards them. But a striver who has the feeling
"
240,"Verse 53] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 197
for service to others, utilizes the material for the service of others,
and thus his desire for pleasures perishes easily. Therefore, Lord
Krsna has mentioned the Discipline of Disinterested Action, as
superior to and easier than the Discipline of Knowledge (5/2-3)
and by it a striver quickly reaches Brahma—the Absolute (5/6).

'Tada gantasi nirvedarh Srotavyasya Srutasya ca'—The pleasure
which men have enjoyed and heard* of and also the pleasures of
heaven etc., which are yet to be heard of, are transient. So, how
can they give peace and joy to the man's self which is permanent?
Thus men become dispassionate. When intellect gets out of the
mire of delusion, then acute discrimination is developed that the

| world is ephemeral while he (the self) is eternal and therefore,
how could the kaleidoscopic world provide peace to him? With
this attitude of mind, he automatically develops detachment,
from the whole wogd.

Lord Krsna has used the term ‘hear’ instead of ‘enjoy’ because
there is attraction for pleasure after hearing about it. Thus ‘hearing’
is an important factor for the attraction of pleasures. Hearing
as a means occupies an important place in the Disciplines of
Knowledge and Devotion for spiritual progress also.

The terms ‘yada’ (when) and ‘tada’ (then) have been used
to emphasize the fact, that there is no rule that it will take so
many years or months or days, to develop this acute dispassion.
As soon as, your intellect crosses the mire of delusion, you will
become dispassionate. It involves no much delay. —

After your intellect, confused by hearing conflicting doctrines,

Self-realization or union, with God. 53 | | ——
Comment:— : |
[After crossing the mire of delusion also, there may be
confusion of mind by hearing conflicting spiritual doctrines. So
Lord Krsna induces Arjuna to get rid of that confusion.]
'‘Srutivipratipanna te yada sthasyati niscala samadhavacala _
buddhistada yogamavapsyasi'—Arjuna was in a fix, whether he
should perform his duty as a Ksatriya or he should avoid the
slaughter of his kith and kin. If he protected his family, he would
shirk his duty. If he performed his duty of fighting, then the
family would not be protected. So he was bewildered.* Therefore
Lord Krsna persuades Arjuna to keep the intellect firm in case
of scriptural opinions and steady in regarding God-realization.
First of all, a striver is unable to make up his mind whether
to have honest and sincere dealings with the worldly people, or
to attain God. Then he decides that he has to render selfless
service to the world. Having taken this decision, he starts showing
indifference and dispassion to the worldly pleasures. Then in the
| spiritual path he comes across different opinions of the scriptures.
So it becomes difficult for him to decide, which opinion he
should follow. In that case by good company or faith etc., he is
either able to take the decision or he surrenders himself to God.
Then by God's grace his intellect becomes firm. Secondly, in all
the scriptures and religions, God, soul and the world, have been
described in different forms and ways. But all of them agree, ""I
am soul, not body,"" ""The world is to be ignored"", ""God 1s to
* A person may be in a dilemma in two ways—in worldly affairs and in
scriptural ordinances or sects such as dualism and non-dualism etc. It is more
difficult to be free from the dilemma of the scriptural ordinances than from that of
the worldly affairs. So Lord Krsna explains that a striver should have a determinate
intellect that he has to realize only God whatsoever may happen.
"
242,"Verse 53] | SADHAKA-SANJIVANI- 199
be realized."" By taking this decision the intellect of the striver
becomes steady. Then he realized God easily. So the only obstacle
to God-realization is lack of firmness of intellect.

The greater the deficiency in reaching at a decision regarding
the contrary spintual doctrines and in his own emancipation,
the greater the delay there is. But in both cases as soon as the
intellect becomes steady and determinate, eternal union with
God is realized. | :

The intellect should be unshakable in order to renounce
affinity for the world, as mentioned by the expression ‘state of
severance from union with pain,' in the twenty-third verse of the
sixth chapter; while it should be steady in order to have affinity
for God as expressed by the expression ‘evenness of mind is
called Yoga’, in the forty-eighth verse of the second chapter.

Here in 'tada yogamavapsyasi Yoga, means to become
established in union with God, from whom there is no disunion.
Only the striver has to abandon his affinity with the unreal. This
union can be realized either by selfless service viz., Discipline
of Disinterested Action, or discrimination viz., Discipline of
Knowledge, or love for God viz., Discipline of Devotion,
or meditation or annihilation of the world viz., Discipline of
Annihilation (Layayoga) or by the process of restraining breath
viz., Discipline of Austerity (Hathayoga) etc.

Appendix—There are two divisions of delusion—‘mohakalila’
viz., the worldly delusion and ‘Srutivipratipatti’—scriptural
(philosophical) delusion. Attachment to the body, wife, sons,
wealth, property etc., 1s ‘worldly delusion’ and ‘Dvaita’
(dualism ), ‘Advaita’ (non-dualism), ‘Visistadvaita’ (qualified
dualism) and  ‘dvaitadvaita’ (dualism-non-dualism)—to get
entangled in these ‘isms’ is ‘scriptural delusion’. By renouncing
these two types of delusion, a man gets detached from pleasures
and his intellect becomes stable. When the intellect becomes
stable, “Yoga’ is attained viz., the distance from God comes
"
243,"200 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter2
to an end and you come near to God. By ‘Karmayoga’ you
come near God, by ‘Jnanayoga’ difference is wiped out and
there is ‘Abheda’ and by ‘Bhaktiyoga’ there is ‘abhinnata’ viz.,
the devotee becomes God’s own self. By attaining perfection
in either Karmayoga or Jnanayoga, a striver gets the fruit
of both (Gita 5/4-5). - a , |

If a person has the only aim of salvation and has no selfish
motive by having affinity for wealth-property and family-relatives
etc., then he crosses the worldly delusion. If he does not want to
gain bookish knowledge (rot-learning) by studying the scriptures
but has the only aim to realize the self, he crosses the scriptural
delusion. It means that a striver, should neither be enamoured

by the worldly delusion nor by the scriptural (philosophical)
differences of opinions viz., he should not insist on any sect
or religion. Thus he becomes eligible for ‘Yoga’, salvation or
devotion. Besides this there is no need of any special eligibility
(qualification).

| further (in 3/1-2). Had Arjuna put a question regarding his doubts
about action and knowledge, in the fifty-fourth verse here, then
his question regarding the mark of the man of steadfast wisdom,
would have been much delayed. ]

'Samadhisthasya't— Here, this term has been used for the
person who has attained God-realization.

‘Sthitaprajiiasya'—This term has been used both for the
enlightened (God-realized) soul, as well as the striver. The
striver who is of a firm resolve and who never budges from
his spiritual path, is also called a man of steadfast wisdom. The
realized soul whose intellect is already steadfast, is also a man
of steadfast wisdom. :

Now, the question arises, while Arjuna put the question about
the enlightened soul only, why Lord Krsna included the striver
too. The answer is that, in the Discipline of Knowledge aspirants
generally develop disinclination for activities. The perfect soul
gets total disinclination. An aspirant of the Discipline of Devotion,
has an inclination to the recitation of Divine name, meditation,
association with holy men and study of the scriptures etc. These —
activities pervade in abundance, in him. In the perfect state, only

* Here the word ‘Samadhi’ has been used for God as it was also used in the
forty-fourth verse of this chapter.
"
245,"202 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
activities pertaining to God are performed. Thus there is a clear
difference in the degree of activities, of aspirants and realized
souls in both the Disciplines of Knowledge and Devotion. But
in the Discipline of Action, the flow of activities goes on as
usual, without any change, in both the stages—as a striver and
a perfected soul. So, there is a description of strivers, from the
forty-first verse to the forty-fifth verse, and also from the forty-
seventh verse to the fifty-third verse. Thus, in the context, the
means by which strivers, can be perfect souls” have been enunciated
and the marks of the perfect soul, have also been described.

""Ka bhasa'—What is the description or mark of an enlightened
soul? (Lord Krsna answers this question in the next verse).

'Sthitadhih kim prabhaseta'—How does the enlightened soul
speak? (Lord Krsna _ will answer this question in fifty-sixth and
fifty-seventh verses.)

‘Kimasita'—How does he sit viz., how does he become
dispassionate? (Lord Krsna has answered these in verses from
fifty-eighth to sixty-third.) :

'Vrajeta kim'—How does he walk viz., how does he behave?
(Lord Krsna has answered this question in the verses sixty-fourth
to seventy-first.) :

, — The Blessed Lord said: :
| - QO Partha (Arjuna), when a man discards all his desires visiting
the mind, and is self-satisfied in own self, he is said to be stable,
in wisdom. 55
Comment:— oo | |
[According to the gospel of the Gita, a striver, can
attain perfection, (God-realization), by any discipline (that of |
Disinterested Action or Devotion etc.,) which he follows according
to his interest and liking and his perfection is described by that
means only. Example—A striver following the Discipline of
Devotion worships God constantly, meditating on Him with
exclusive devotion (12/6). Therefore, in the enlightened state,
he becomes free from malice towards all beings (12/13). In
the Discipline of Knowledge the striver perceives himself
detached from these gunas (attributes) (modes) and is above
them (14/19) and in the enlightened state, he sits like a witness
firmly established in God, beyond all the gunas, having risen above
them (14/22—25). Similarly, in Karmayoga it is the abandoning
of all desires that is important. Hence the enlightened soul
abandons all desires. In this verse Lord Krsna dwells upon this point. ]
'‘Prajahati yada kamansarvanpartha manogatan'—It means that
desire does not exist in the self, because the self is everlasting
while desire is transient. Moreover it does not stay permanently
in the mind but comes into it—'manogatan'. But the man by
identifying himself with body, senses, mind and intellect, accepts
the desire visiting the mind as resting in his own self.
‘Jahati'—Use of the prefix ‘Pra’ before the verb ‘jahati’,
indicates that there is no trace of any desire left in him. A man
can neither renounce his own self nor the things which are not
his own, but he can renounce only the things which actually are
not his own, but he has mistaken them as his own. Similarly,
desires do not exist in one's own self, but one accepts them as
existing in one's own self, so he has to cast them off.
"
247,"204 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 2

The term ‘kaman’ (desires) also includes the term 'sarvan’'
(all), yet ‘sarvan' has been added to emphasize the fact that,
every fragment of all the desires should be cast off.

'Atmanyevatmana tustah'—After abandoning all the desire
completely, a man is satisfied in himself and with himself i.e.,
he is spontaneously contented in his own self. |

Contentment is of two kinds—one is said to be a virtue as
it relates to inner sense. It is there as a result of no desire in
the inner sense. But the other kind is the self itself. As the self
never has any trace of discontentment so it is called contentment
incammate the Self itself). The latter contentment is eternal. It
knows no change. It is spontaneous. It is not the result of any
practice or thought. The intellect of such a contented men always
remains steadfast automatically. |

'Sthitaprajiiastadocyate'—Actually a man is always steady in
wisdom, but when he accepts his desires, because of unsteady
mind, he does not realize his stableness in wisdom. When he
abandons his desires viz., accepts the non-existence of desires,
he realizes his stability in wisdom.

A striver has to make effort to concentrate his mind, but by
renouncing desires he does not have to do so, instead he attains
this stage, in a spontaneous manner. :

In the discipline of action, the striver is concerned with
actions more than anything else. Action without selfish motive,
is said to be the means for a sage to attain Yoga (Gita 6/3).
Therefore such a striver is concerned with actions relating
to the stage when he is a striver, as well as when he is an
enlightened soul. Whatever standard an enlightened soul sets,
people in general, follow the same (Gita 3/21). The Lord has
explained, in the fourth chapter also, that the striver following the
Discipline of Disinterested Action while performing actions remains
detached and while remaining detached he performs actions (4/18).

In the fifty-third verse Lord Krsna had advised two things
"
248,"Verse 55] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 205
to Arjuna, to keep his intellect immovable regarding scriptural
doctrine and steady in God. So He has used the term ‘yada’
(when) and 'tada' (then) which explain, that a striver is called
stable in wisdom when he is completely free from desires, and
is satisfied in the self. It also means that he is called a striver so
long as he has even a fragment of desire left and an enlightened
soul when desires are totally renounced. Therefore, two important
factors have been explained in the verse—to renounce the desire
and to get established in God.

The same two factors have been explained, in verses fifty-
six; fifty-seven; fifty-eight; fifty-nine; sixty and sixty-one; sixty-
two to sixty-five; sixty-six to sixty-eight; sixty-nine; seventy and
seventy-one and seventy-two.

Appendix—One division is of those who are of unsteady
intellect while the other division is of those of steady intellect.
The Lord has described the men of unsteady intellect from the
forty-first verse to the forty-fourth verse; now He describes the
men of steady wisdom from the fifty-fifth verse to the seventy-first
verse. When a striver having renounced the worldly inclination
is established in the self, he is said to be stable in wisdom.

He, who has the aim of God-realization, has a determinate
and single pointed intellect because God is also only one. But
he who has the worldly aim, his intellect is full of numberless
desires because worldly objects are numberless (Gita 2/41).

In order to attain equanimity, steadiness of intellect is very
necessary. In Patafjala YogadarSana importance has been attached
to stability of mind (concentration of the mind). But the Gita
attaches importance to the stability of intellect (steadfastness of
aim). The reason is that in God-realization the steadiness of the
mind is not so important as is the steadiness of intellect. By the
steadiness of mind worldly ‘siddhis’ (accomplishments or occult
powers) are gained but by the steadiness of intellect, spiritual
perfection (salvation) is attained. In Karmayoga steadiness of
"
249,"206 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2

intellect .is important. If the mind becomes concentrated, how

will a Karmayogi discharge his duty? The reason is that when

the mind becomes steady, the outward activities stop. The Lord

also orders Arjuna to discharge his duties being steadfast in Yoga
| (equanimity)—‘yogastha kuru karmani’ (Gita 2/48).

The Lord by using the terms ‘prajahati’ and ‘kamansarvan’
means that there shouldn’t be even a trace of desire, but it should
be renounced totally. The reason is that this desire is the main
stumbling block to God-realization.

He, whose mind remains unperturbed in sorrow, who does not
crave for pleasure, and who is free from passion, fear and anger
is called a sage with stable wisdom. 56
Comment:— |

[Arjuna puts a question, attaching importance to action, while
Lord Krsna answers, attaching importance to feelings, because
a change in feeling brings about a corresponding change in
action.* The Lord is discussing here, the feeling or the motive
which change the character of action throughout outwardly, it
may seem quite different.] :

* Whenever in the Gita Arjuna puts a question attaching importance to
action, Lord Krsna answers it attaching importance to feelings and understanding
because an action is performed according to the feelings and understanding. For
example Arjuna in the fourteenth chapter asked, ""What are the marks of him who
has transcended the three modes?"" Lord Krsna attaching importance to feelings
replies, ""He remains even-minded.""
"
250,"Verse 56] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI ‘207

* Puhkhesvanudvignamanah’—There is no end to sorrow,
calumny, dishonour and unfavourable circumstances, in this
world. But a man of wisdom, remains unperturbed, because the
aim of his life is to discharge his duty to the best of his ability
and capacity, for the welfare to others, without having any desire
for its. fruit. So, he always remains happy and unperturbed even
in the most unfavourable circumstances. :

'‘Sukhesu vigatasprhah'—He does not crave for any kind of
pleasure such as praise, honour and favourable circumstances etc.,
nor does he have a desire to prolong, such a state. He remains
unruffled in the midst of favourable or hostile circumstances.

'Vitaragabhayakrodhah'—Our entanglement with worldly
things, is known as attachment (raga). If a stronger person
tries to deprive us of worldly possessions, it arouses fear in us,
whereas if a weaker person does so, it arouses anger in us. But
a person who is keen to do good to others, automatically gets
rid of attachment. This freedom from attachment, leads him to
fearlessness and calmness. Thus he becomes free from attachment,
fear and anger. i :

So long as there are perturbations, cravings, attachment,
fear and anger, even in a small measure, a man is called a
striver. But when he is totally free from them, he becomes an
enlightened soul.

[Lust, desire, craving and greed etc., are forms of
attachment. In attachment there is an attraction, for the perishable
worldly objects.} | |

’Sthitadhirmunirucyate'—The mind of such a follower of the
Discipline of Selfless Action, becomes stable. Here, the term
‘muni’ has not been used, for a person who keeps silent. The
Lord has also not used the term 'mauna’ for penance of speech,
but He has used it for mental penance (Gita 17/16). So here,
‘muni: has been used for a contemplative person, free from desire
and attachment. He contemplates to remain unattached, like an
"
251,"208 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
enlightened soul. Throughout his practice he is very cautious to
remain unattached. Such cautiousness automatically persists in
an enlightened soul. That awareness leads him to attainment of
beatitude (Gita 3/19). It is because of this virtue of awareness,
that he has been described by the term 'muni.' |

Comment:— |
[In the previous verse, Lord Krsna explained that a man
of stable wisdom remains unperturbed, while discharging his
duty. In this verse, he explains, that such a man remains stable
in favourable and unfavourable circumstances, which he comes
across as a result of the deeds he performs.] |
""Yah sarvatranabhisnehah'—He remains unattached everywhere
viz., he is not attached to his body, senses, mind, intellect, family
and possessions. He never identifies himself with them, but always
remains untainted by them. Despite his physical association with
senses, objects, circumstances and individuals etc., he remains
quite unattached with them, through the self. |
'Tattatprapya Subhasubham nabhinandati na dvesti—He
remains untainted and unaffected by good and bad, favourable
~ and unfavourable circumstances. Experiencing good or pleasant,
he is not delighted. This delight means mental joy and expression
of joy through words. By encountering evil or unpleasant, he is
not dejected. This dejection means mental suffering and despair,
"
252,"Verse 58] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 209
and the thought why and how this situation has occurred, and
how to get rid of the unpleasant situation. He remains untainted
in favourable and unfavourable circumstances, which we got as
a result of destiny. : :

The expression, ‘tat, tat’, signifies that meeting with all
agreeable and disagreeable persons, incidents, objects and
circumstances that can possibly cause mental perturbations; he
neither rejoices in them-nor hates them whenever, wherever, and
however, he may meet with them:

'Tasya prajiia pratisthita'—His determinate intellect, now
becomes stable in God. -He understands that he is entirely

| unconcerned with the good and evil of the world, because these
always change, while he (soul) always remains the same. There
is no modification in the self, while in the evolutes of matter,
there is always modification. Man identifies himself with the
body and regards the modification of the body as modification
in his own self. But when he realizes the two as separate, his
intellect becomes stable. |

The second interpretation is, that limitless and endless God
cannot be perceived by the intellect, which is limited. So the
intellect merges in God and then there remains nothing besides God.
This is fixation of intellect. in God or stability in wisdom.

A Karmayog! is ever active. Therefore, the Lord, in the fifty-
sixth verse, mentions that he neither craves for success (pleasure)
nor is he perturbed in failure (sorrow), while in this verse He
declares that he neither delighted at receiving the agreeable nor
dejected at the disagreeable. |

Comment:— |

. ""Yada samharate cayarh kirmo'nganiva sarvaSah indriyanind-
riyarthebhyastasya prajiia pratisthita'—Here, the purpose of the
illustration of the tortoise is, that as a tortoise withdraws its six
limbs—four legs, a tail and a head—into the shell to protect
itself against possible dangers, so does an enlightened one also
withdraw his five senses and one mind from sense-objects. If
he has the least affinity with senses, he cannot be a man of

stable wisdom. : .
Here the verb 'sarnharate’, has been used, to emphasize the
fact, that he does not even think of worldly pleasures.
In this verse the term ‘yada’ has been used but 'tada’ is not used.

The reason is, that when the senses are withdrawn from their

' gense-objects, the self which is axiomatic, is realized, because
that is beyond the limit of time. So the word 'tada’ which denotes
time, has not been applied. Self-realization or God-realization is
axiomatic, and 1s beyond the reach of senses, but we are veiled
by the curtain of pleasures and thus cannot realize Him. He still
exists. But as soon as that veil is removed viz., we renounce
our affinity to the worldly pleasures, and He is revealed.

visaya Vinivartante. niraharasya dehinah. .

Sense-objects cease to exist for him, who does not enjoy them

with his senses, but the taste for them may persist. This relish,

also disappears from a man of stable mind, when he, realises

the Supreme. 59

Comment:—

'Visaya vinivartante niraharasya dehinah rasavarjam'— A man
becomes an abstainer in two ways (1) Fasting by one's own will
or owing to sickness. (11) Abstaining from sense enjoyments. Here, .
the term has been used, to refer to a striver, who withdraws his
senses from sense-objects.

_ The senses of a sick man become unfit for indulgence,
but craving in them, for sense enjoyment persists. He hopes to
enjoy these after recovery. Similarly, sense-objects cease for the
abstinent striver, but the taste persists. It means that his body
and senses come under restraint, but his mind wanders.

The dispassionate strivers who have instinctively no attachment |
for pleasure, become free from this taste. The striver who wants
to follow the spiritual path but is not dispassionate, can restrain
his body and senses by thinking of the adverse consequences
of sense enjoyments, though his taste persists.

""Raso'pyasya param drstva nivartate'—The relish of the man
of steadfast wisdom, who realises the Supreme, disappears. It 1s
a rule. But the contrary that with the disappearance (cessation)
of relish, a striver attains steadfast wisdom, is not true.

""Raso'pyasya’ means that a striver has feeling in his egoism
viz., 'I ness'. This taste changes itself into attachment. Therefore,
a striver should have determination that he as a striver has no
attachment, no desire. This sort of determination (aim) frees him
from relish, and after realizing God this relish disappears altogether.

Appendix—By accepting the existence and attaching value to
pleasures, in the mind there ensues a subtle attraction, lovability
"
255,"212 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
and sweetness for pleasures, it is named ‘Rasa’ (relish). As a
greedy man rejoices at heart by receiving money and a voluptuary
is rejoiced at heart by coming in contact with a woman, it is
called ‘Rasa’. After enjoying pleasure a man declares, “Oh! how
much I relished!’’ This is recollection of that ‘Rasa’ (relish).
This relish abides in the assumed ego (I’ness) (cijjadagranthi).
The gross form of this relish is attachment to pleasures.

So long as a man has relish for sense enjoyments, he has
to depend on Prakrti (Matter) and its evolutes (actions, objects
and persons). When he is free. from this relish, his dependence
totally perishes, his dependence on sense enjoyments stops and
he is no longer a slave to them. a

So long as a person accepts the existence of pleasures, attaches
importance to them and has relish for them, the spiritual (unworldly)

.  Yelish for God is not revealed. Not to speak of unworldly relish,
he can’t have the determinate intellect to attain Him (Gita 2/44).
After merely withdrawing outwardly the senses from sense objects,
the relish (taste) persists. By attaining Self-realization this taste
disappears, this relish disappears—‘pararn drstva nivartate’. It
means that when a striver realizes that he is different from the ©
world and realizes his identity with God, then the perishable taste
disappears. With the disappearance (cessation) of the perishable
taste, imperishable (non-stop) relish is aroused.

After Self-realization this relish for pleasures certainly
disappears but even before Self-realization by being indifferent
to it, by reflection, by good company and by the grace of saints, a
striver can be free from this relish. The company of the enlightened
exalted souls can also free a striver from this taste (relish).

The three disciplines—Karmayoga, Jnanayoga and Bhaktiyoga
can free a striver from the perishable relish. When a striver
starts relishing the taste of service in Karmayoga, the taste of
Self-realization in Jaanayoga and the taste of devotion (love)
in Bhaktiyoga, his relish for the perishable pleasures starts
"
256,"Verse 59] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 213
disappearing. As a child in childhood relishes toys but when
he grows up, he starts relishing wealth, then his relish for toys
naturally disappears. Similarly when a striver relishes the spiritual
discipline, the relish for mundane pleasures naturally disappears.
When relish persists and pleasures are enjoyed, then a man’s
heart melts and he is overpowered by pleasures. But when he
is freed from relish, he may come across worldly pleasures but
they don’t cause the least agitation in his mind (Gita 2/70).
He has no such inclination that pleasure may attract him. As’
you put a bag of money before an animal, it does not covet
for it and after seeing a beautiful woman it is not lustful. An
. animal doesn’t know the value of money and a woman but
an enlightened exalted soul knows money as well the.
woman (Gita 2/69), yet he is free from greed and lust. When we
have an itching sensation in any organ of the body, we scratch
it with our fingers, and when this sensation ends, it does not
make any difference in fingers, there is no alteration in them. :
Similarly an enlightened soul uses the sense-objects but his mind
remains the same unperturbed and free from agitation. The reason
is that being free from relish, he has no inclination for enjoying’
pleasures. Whatever he does, he does it for the welfare of others
and to comfort them. Contemplation on the sense-objects for
one’s own pleasure leads one to ruin or fall (Gita 2/62-63). But
even the use of the sense-objects not for one’s own pleasure,
does not lead to bondage (Gita 2/64-65). .
The perishable relish (taste) is instantaneous, it does not
Jast long. The relish which we have for a woman or money at
the beginning does not persist in the same degree afterwards.
We relish the food at the beginning but after each morsel the
relish decreases and finally ends and then we have a dislike for
that food. But the imperishable relish never lessens but always
remains the same. Enjoyment of the perishable relish results in
inertness, shortage, grief, diseases, fear, commotion and other evils.

257,"| 214 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
| A voluptuous person can’t escape these evils because pleasures
certainly lead to these evils. Therefore the Lord has mentioned the

Comment:—

""Tani sarvani sarhnyamya yukta asita matparah'—By controlling

because pride goes before a fall. He should, rather, feel that it

Generally, in a striver following the Discipline of Action, there is
predominance of action. Therefore, he develops egoism. Due to
this egoistic feeling, he pays little attention to the divine grace,
though the endowment of human body, inclination, practice and
success of this discipline, are all the result of divine grace. By
His special divine grace, the Lord is exhorting the striver to be
devoted to Him. Thus, he should devote himself heart and soul
to Him, thinking that he is God's and God is his, while he is

neither of the world nor is the-world his. He should infuse a
sense of 'T' in only God, not in the world, at all. .

This section deals with the Discipline of Disinterested
Action. So, Lord Krsna should have told Arjuna some method
of that discipline. But Lord Krsna time and again has laid great
emphasis on devotion to Him, and has glorified it very much.
So He declares— ""Among all Yogis, he who worships Me with
faith, his innermost self merged in Me, is considered by Me, to
be the best Yogi—most devout (Gita 6/47)."" |

""Vase hi yasyendriyani tasya prajiia. pratisthita'—In the
fifty-ninth verse, Lord Krsna said, that even with the cessation
of sense-objects, a striver does not become a man of steadfast
wisdom. But, here he says that the wisdom of the striver who
has controlled his senses, is stable. Why? The clarification is
that, in 2/59 even at the cessation of the sense-objects the taste
(relish) for sense enjoyments persists. But here in this verse,
the senses of the striver are controlled and his taste has also
disappeared. Thus the striver becomes stable in wisdom, (mind)
at the cessation of taste.

Appendix—The Lord exhorts the striver following Karmayoga
to devote himself heart and soul to Him by using the term
‘matparah’—this is a special feature of devotion because without
being devoted to Him, total control over senses is difficult.

In Karmayoga there is renunciation and renunciation leads
to peace and happiness. This happiness follows cessation of
miseries. This is with a result of attaining something. A Bhaktiyogi
attains eternal bliss. Therefore without the bliss attained by
devotion (love), senses are not totally controlled. Secondly in
Karmayoga only by intense dispassion (detachment), senses
are controlled but in devotion (being devoted to God) even
by a little dispassion, senses are easily controlled. Therefore
the Lord has used the term ‘matparah’. -

to God? The answer is provided in the next two verses.

Contemplating constantly on the objects of senses, a man
develops attachment for them; from attachment springs desire
and from desire (unfulfilled) originates anger. From anger arises
delusion; from delusion, confusion of memory; from which grows
loss of reason; and with loss of reason (discrimination), he goes to
complete ruin. 62-63.
Comment:—

. ‘Dhyayato visayanpumsah sangastesupajayate’-—When a
man does not devote himself to God viz., he does not meditate
on God, he broods on objects of senses, because in that
case there is nothing else to contemplate on, except the world.
Thus, by. brooding over them, he develops attachment for
them. Due to this attachment he enjoys sense-objects. This
enjoyment may be mental or physical. The pleasure resulting
from enjoyment, enhances attachment. Due to this enhanced
attachment, he repeatedly dwells on sense-objects. It is a rule
that the enhanced attachment persists, whether he enjoys the
sense-objects or not. ,

'‘Sangatsafijayate kamah'—By developing attachment for
"
261,"218 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter2
sense enjoyments, one has a desire to acquire and enjoy those
sense-objects. —

""Kamatkrodho'bhijayate'— Gratification of desire misleads to
greed and one who creates an obstacle in the possibility of its
gratification, becomes a victim of anger. The desire for respect
and honour on the ground of caste, stage of life and virtues etc.,
also causes anger, if some obstacles are put in its gratification.

Desire is a rajasika trait; delusion a tamasika one, and anger
lies between the two. If you are angry with either, it means that
you have attachment for something or the other. If you are angry
with a man who defames you, it means that you are attached

: to fame. If you are enraged with a person who censures you, it
proves your pride of innocence and so on.

'Krodhadbhavati sammohah'—From anger, ensues delusion. In
fact, delusion ensues not only from anger, but also from desire,
greed and attachment.

(i) Delusion born of desire, veils discrimination and so a
man goaded by desire performs undesirable actions.

(11) Out of anger, a deluded person utters harsh and pinching
words, to even friends and adorable ones, and performs wrong
and cruel deeds.

(iti) Delusion born of greed makes a man blind and he cannot

_ distinguish between the real and the unreal, the right and the
wrong and he cheats others by using fraudulent methods.
. (iv) Delusion born of attachment, creates partiality.

Now the question arises, why Lord Krsna has said that
delusion ensues from anger while it ensues from desire, greed
and attachment, as well. If we give a serious thought, we come
to know that goaded by desire, greed and attachment, a man
thinks of his own selfish motive and pleasure, while in anger
he thinks of doing evil to others. Thus, delusion born of anger
is more disastrous, than that born of the other three. Therefore
"
262,"Verse 64-65] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 219
Lord Krsna has said that delusion ensues from anger.
~ 'Sammohiatsmrtivibhramah'—From delusion arises confusion of
memory. It means that a man forgets his aim to attain salvation,
or to follow the spiritual path, in accordance with the ordinance
of the scriptures etc. | 4 ,
'Smrtibhramsad buddhinasah'—From confusion of memory
arises loss of reason viz., a man cannot discriminate between
right and wrong. | |
‘Buddhinasatpranagyati'—Loss of discrimination paves the
way to self-destruction. , :
Therefore, it is obligatory for all strivers to devote themselves
heart and soul to God, in order to escape self-destruction.

_ Brooding on the objects of senses, leads to attachment;
attachment leads to desire; desire to anger; anger to delusion;
delusion to loss of memory; loss of memory to loss of reason
and finally, loss of reason leads to utter ruin. Though, it takes
time to describe this order yet the rise of these propensities
leading to the destruction of man is, as fast as death caused
by an electric shock. | |

- _ But a self-controlled Yogi in practice or a striver, while

Loe the attainment of such placidity, all his sorrows come to an

oe end; and the intellect of such a person of tranquil mind, soon

- becomes, firmly established in God. 64-65

na ‘Comment:—

7 'Tu'—In the previous verse, Lord Krsna said, that by

| contemplating on the objects of senses a man goes to complete
ruin, while here He says that the striver, free from attachment

| while using the sense-objects with the senses, becomes firmly
established in God. So the Lord has used the term ‘tu’ (but), to

- differentiate between the two. :

a -  'Vidheyatma'—To achieve his aim it is very necessary for a
| striver, specially for a Karmayogi, to control his mind, otherwise

: he may have attachment for pleasure and thus may go to ruin.

7 'Atmavasyaih ragadvesaviyuktaih indriyaih'—As the term
‘vidheyatma’ has been used for controlling the mind, so the

7 word ‘atmavasyaih’ is used, for sense-control. In worldly dealings,

. senses should be kept under control, and for sense-control
oo they should be free from attachment and aversion. Therefore,
Lord Krsna, in the thirty-fourth verse of the third chapter, has

7 warned strivers and said, ""attachment and aversion are rooted,

oe ~ jn all sense-objects. A striver should not come under their sway,

7 because they are verily his enemies."" Similarly He has said in

- the third verse of the fifth chapter, ""The striver who is free from

. the pairs of opposites, such as attachment and aversion etc., is

| easily set free from bondage.”

, ‘Visayan caran'—A striver, who has controlled his mind
and whose senses are controlled and free from attachment and
aversion, uses the sense-objects, but does not enjoy them viz.,
he does not derive pleasure from them. And it is enjoyment,

rather than use, which leads him to ruin. |
"
264,"Verse 64-65] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 221
'‘Prasadamadhigacchati'—A striver who utilizes the sense-
objects being free from attachment and aversion attains placidity
(purity) of mind. This placidity (serenity) of mind, is. called
mental austerity (Gita 17/16) which is superior to the austerity
of body and austerity of speech. So a striver should neither
enjoy the sense-objects with attachment, nor should renounce
them with aversion, because both attachment and aversion lead ,
him to affinity for the world. Such a striver attains placidity of
mind and if that placidity of mind, is not enjoyed, that leads to
God-realization.
'‘Prasade sarvaduhkhanarn hanirasyopajayate'—With the
attainment of such placidity of mind, all his sorrows come to
an end, because it is attachment only, which causes sorrows.
These sorrows give birth to desire which again causes sorrow.
When attachment goes away, the mind becomes serene and that
serenity destroys all sorrows. Actually all the sorrows are born
because of affinity for matter and its evolutes—the world and
the body. A striver has affinity for the world, with the desire to
enjoy pleasures. This desire is born of despair or the feeling of
something lacking in himself. When there is placidity of mind,
despair disappears. When despair is lost, there is no desire for
pleasures, and when there is no desire for pleasures, affinity for
the world automatically breaks off, and then sorrows disappear. It
means that placidity of the mind, results in breaking off affinity
for the world and establishment of the self in God. |
Here 'Sarvaduhkhanam hanth' does not mean that a striver
will not come across unfavourable and sorrowful circumstances;
but it means that those circumstances cannot create commotion
and agitation in his mind. |
‘Prasannacetaso hyasu buddhih paryavatisthate'—The intellect
of such a person of tranquil mind, soon becomes firmly established
in God viz., the striver himself becomes established in God and —
his intellect has no doubts, in the least.
"
265,"222 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2

Enhancement of either placidity or uneasiness. for God,
enables a striver to realize God. The Gopis were locked up by
their husbands, brothers and parents and prevented from meeting
Lord Krsna. The uneasiness to meet the Lord, destroyed their
sins and the placidity of mind by meditation on God, destroyed
their virtues. Thus, being free from sins and virtues, and leaving
their bodies, they were the first to meet God. But in the worldly
affairs, placidity and uneasiness of mind, lead a man to bondage
and strengthen the bondage, because his aim is to enjoy the
worldly pleasures. The living examples are common worldly
people who are entangled in the worldly snare, because of
placidity and uneasiness, in mundane affairs.

The inner self, is overwhelmed in placidity and uneasiness. Just
as the colour which is added to.liquid wax becomes a permanent
part of it, in the same way, whatever thoughts are put into the
overwhelmed inner self these become a permanent part of it and
lead the striver to salvation or to damnation. Therefore a striver
should neither be pleased nor displeased, while gaining or losing
the most charming objects of the world. |

Appendix—There are two divisions—one of ‘Bhoga’
(pleasures) and one of ‘Yoga’. If a ‘Bhogi’ (voluptuary) having
attachment and aversion dwells upon the objects of senses, he
goes to ruin (fall) (Gita 2/62-63). But if a ‘Yogi’ freed from
attachment and aversion utilizes. sense-objects, he does not go
to ruin, rather he attains God.

: A person freed from likes and dislikes does not enjoy and
relish pleasures because it is not his aim. He utilizes the sense-
objects without coming under the sway of attachment, having the
sense of detachment (Gita 3/34). Therefore he attains placidity
(purity) of mind. The use of sense-objects with the sense of
renunciation, is indeed not ‘Bhoga’. From the view-point of
"
266,"Verse 66] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 223
people it appears that he is using sense-objects; therefore here
the expression ‘visayan caran’ has been used.

By being free from attachment and aversion, placidity of
mind is attained. There should be cheerfulness every time, there
should not be any distress, there should not be monotony—this
is ‘Prasada’ (placidity of mind). If a striver is not satiated with
this placidity and he does not enjoy it, it will very quickly lead
him to God-realization.

He, who has not controlled his mind and senses, can have
no determinate intellect; nor can such an undisciplined man
have a sense of duty. A man without having a sense of duty,
can have no peace; and how can there be happiness, for
one lacking peace? 66
Comment:—

[In the Discipline of Disinterested Action, control over the
mind and senses is important, because without control, desire
persists and with the persistence of desire, the mind does not
get fixed. Therefore, it is obligatory for a striver following
the Discipline of Action to control his mind and senses. What
happens to the man who has not controlled his mind and senses,
is explained in this verse.] |

'Nasti buddhirayuktasya'—He who has not controlled his
mind and senses cannot have determinate intellect* that he has

* Without change of the sense of I (egotism), senses are not controlled
"
267,"224 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
only to realize God, because he indulges in worldly pleasures
and seeks prosperity. He develops desire for riches, honour and

_ bodily comforts etc. These numerous desires, keep his intellect
obsessed and do not allow him to have a stable intellect.

‘Na cayuktasya bhavana’—He whose intellect is not
determinate, cannot have the feeling, that he has to discharge

| his duty by renouncing attachment and desire etc., because he
has not fixed the aim of his life.

'Na cabhavayatah santih'— The man, who does not discharge
his duty efficiently and sincerely, can have no peace, whosoever
he may be. oo :

‘ASantasya kutah sukham'~-How can he who lacks peace
be happy? He cannot be happy, because his heart is filled with
agitation and commotion. Despite acquiring all agreeable sense-
objects, his mental perturbation cannot be wiped out. In other
words he cannot be happy. |

of a person who had not controlled his mind and senses, cannot
be determinate.

_ Just as the wind sails a ship on water, the mind that yields
to one of the wandering senses, takes away the discrimination of

and without sense-control there cannot be determinate intellect. But 1f a striver
changes his egotism and accepts that he is a striver whose aim is nothing but
God-realization, his mind and senses are instinctively controlled.
"
268,"Verse 67] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 225
Comment:— : |

[God has bestowed upon man a human body to attain Him.
So a man should firmly resolve to attain God-realization. This
resolve, removes his attachment for pleasures and makes his
intellect determinate. But what happens if the intellect does not
become determinate, has been described here.]

'  ""Indriyanam hi caratérh yanmano'nu vidhiyate'—Senses are
involuntarily drawn to the sense-objects. Mind that follows anyone
of the senses, is naturally led astray ‘by it. For example, while
relishing a tasteful dish, the sense of taste gets attached to it,
and then it attracts the mind, and thus the misdirected mind gets
entangled in this taste.

_ 'Tadasya harati prajiiam'—When the mind gets entangled in
pleasures, man immediately loses his determinate intellect that
he has to realize God only.

'Vayurnavamivambhasi'—A ship without a rudder is at
the mercy of a strong wind. As a rudderless ship does not
reach its destination, a misdirected mind takes away man's
discrimination. |

A strong wind either pushes away the ship in the wrong
direction or sinks it. But a skilful sailor, manages the ship in
such a way, that the wind instead of pushing it away from
its course, helps it in sailing and reaching its destination.
Similarly, the misdirected mind misguides discrimination, in
two ways—lIt leads it astray from the path of God-realization
and engages it in sense-pleasures or it ruins him by entangling
it, in prohibited pleasures. But a controlled mind and senses
do not take the intellect away ward, they rather help one in
realizing God (2/64-65).

Appendix—Here a doubt may arise, why have the meanings
of the terms ‘yat’ and ‘tat’ been taken ‘mind’ rather than
‘senses’ viz., why has it been said that the mind rather than
"
269,"226 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {[Chapter2
senses takes away reason? The clarification is that in the
sixtieth verse of this chapter it has been said that senses
sway the mind and in the forty-second verse of the third
chapter it is mentioned that mind is superior to the senses
and intellect is greater (subtle, higher and more powerful)
than the mind. It proves that senses sway the mind and
the mind sways the intellect. Secondly in swaying the
intellect; the mind is important, senses are not important.
The reason is that unless the mind accompanies senses,
senses don’t know sense-objects—‘adhisthaya manascayarn
visayanupasevate’ (Gita 15/9). In Srimadbhagavata Datt&treyaji
Maharaja declares—
tadaivamatmanyavaruddhacitto na veda kificid bahirantaram va
yathesukaro nrpatim vrajantamisau gatatma na dadarSa parsve
_. (Srimadbha. 11/9/13)

‘‘He, whose mind ts tied up in the soul, has no knowledge
of anything outward or inward. I saw that an arrow-maker was
so much engrossed in arrow-making that he did not notice the
king’s cavalcade in procession passing by him.’’

The arrow-maker had the sense of hearing and its sense-
object was sound also, but he could not hear because his mind
was not diverted towards the procession. When without the mind,
the senses can’t even know their sense-objects, then how can
they sway the intellect? They can’t.

Link:— In the next verse, Lord Krsna describes the condition
of the striver, who has controlled his senses.

Therefore, O mighty-armed, his intellect is stable, whose senses
are completely controlled against sense-objects. 68 .
Comment:— | |

'Tasmadyasya mahabaho nigrhitani sarvasah indriyanindriyarthe-
bhyastasya prajiia pratisthita'—Lord Krsna concludes the topic of
the mind and the senses, by using the word 'tasmad' (therefore)
and says, that the intellect of a person whose mind and senses
are completely free from the worldly attractions, is stable.

By giving the term 'sarvasah' (completely), Hé means to
explain that his senses are not inclined towards pleasures,
whether he lives in the world or in seclusion and even if his
mind and senses are directed to the sense-objects, they do not
lead his intellect, astray. ° : |

‘Nigrhitani’ (restrained) means that the senses have no
attachment for the sense-objects. As a snake, without teeth has
no poison, senses without attachment and aversion, have no
poison to degrade a man from a spiritual path; these become
sublimated and lead a striver, to divinity.

This verse means, that if a striver has determination that his
aim is to realize God, rather than to enjoy worldly pleasures and
prosperity, his intellect will become stable.

are completely restrained from their objects, and an ordinary
man? Here is the answer.

That, which is night to all beings, in that state (of Divine
"
271,"228 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
Knowledge and Supreme Bliss) an emancipated person keeps
awake. And that (the everchanging worldly happiness), in which
all beings keep awake, is night, to the enlightened seer. 69
Comment:— | |

""Ya ni§A sarvabhiitanam'—Those worldly people whose senses
and mind are uncontrolled and who are immersed in pleasure
are, asleep in the dark, because they never think that the aim
of human life, is emancipation or salvation. Further, they never
think ""What is God?’ ""What is Self-realization?’ ""Why are we
suffering?’ ""Why are there all these burning sensations?’ Where
will our misdeeds take us?' Turning away from these thoughts,

: ‘1s complete darkness, for the worldly people. .

Here the term, 'bhitinadm’, has been used to explain the fact

that human beings who hanker after pleasures and prosperity,
and are immersed in them, are like other beings, such as
birds and beasts etc., because both have no inclination for
God-realization. If there is any difference between the two, it
is that discrimination, human beings is much more developed
than beasts’ and birds, and therefore, by using discrimination,
‘they can serve others and attain salvation or God-realization,
while birds and beasts cannot. On the other hand, if they
misuse this discrimination in hankering after pleasures and
prosperity, they can be more harmful to the society, than
even wild beasts. Animals and birds eat food, only to sustain
their life, they never hoard. But human beings are given to
hoarding, whatever they get. Therefore, they create obstacles
to the utilization of those things by others.

'Tasyam jagarti sarnyami'—When the worldly people remain
asleep in the dark, having no inclination for God-realization, the
seer who has controlled his senses and mind and who has no
attachment for pleasures and prosperity and whose aim. of life
is only God-realization, remains wakeful because his intuition,
"
272,"Verse 69] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 229
his concepts and precepts, are all filled with Divinity. -.

'Yasyam jagrati bhitani'—-The worldly people who want
to accumulate wealth, by means fair or foul, and who hanker
after transient sensual pleasures, honour and praise etc., are
wakeful .of mundane affairs. : :

‘Sa ni§& pasyato muneh'—The worldly people, feel very
happy and deem themselves very wise, in enjoying and
hoarding worldly pleasures. These, a seer, in the state of
Divine Knowledge and Supreme Bliss, perceives as dark.

- As children, while playing marbles attach great importance
to small balls, of glass or clay, so people attach importance
to worldly prosperity and pleasure and for gaining these they
employ all sorts of means, fair or foul. But a self-controlled
seer, knows that all mundane pleasures, prosperity and praise
etc., are transient, illusory and changing, while God and his
own self, are eternal, real and permanent. He also knows, how
the best use of mundane objects can be made, and how far
they can be utilized, for the welfare of others. He uses them
in the service of others. |

In spite of the manifest appearance of the world to the
mind and senses, he has a firm conviction that the world 1s a
mere illusion, and has no real existence at all. So wakefulness
of the worldly people, is just like a dark night for him.

Appendix—-The worldly people remain busy in hoarding
wealth and enjoying pleasures and value them. They are very
clever and expert in worldly affairs. They learn different types
of arts and crafts, make several inventions, regard the worldly
achievements as their progress, glorify worldly things, perform
austere penance in order to enjoy pleasures by living forever,
worship gods, and recite (sacred text) incantation etc. But an
enlightened liberated exalted soul and strivers perceive all
this as dark, they don’t attach the least importance to such a
"
273,"230 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter2
progress, because from their view-point the entire: world upto
the abode of Brahma has no existence at all—‘nasato vidyate
bhavah’ (Gita 2/16), ‘abrahma bhuvanallokah punaravartino’rjuna’
(Gita 8/16). a |

The worldly people remain engrossed in worldly affairs and
think that there is nothing besides these pleasures—nanyadastiti
vadinah’ (Gita 2/42), ‘kamopabhogaparama etavaditi niscitah’
(Gita 16/11). Spirituality is beyond the access of their intellect.
But a striver following the spiritual path besides knowing
spirituality also knows the world. Therefore the term ‘pasyatah’
has been used for them. The worldly people perceive only the
night (they remain asleep in the dark), they don’t perceive
the day (Divinity), but a “Yogi’ perceives the day as well as
the night (the worldly pleasures and prosperity as dark)—this
is the difference between the two. For example a child has
perceived only childhood, not youth, but an old man besides
perceiving the old age has also perceived childhood and
youth. A hoarder of wealth doesn’t know renunciation while
a renunciate who has renounced the mundane wealth knows
the value of collection of wealth and also its renunciation. This
is a rule that a man engrossed in worldly affairs cannot know
the reality about the world. By keeping himself aloof from
the world, he can know the reality about the world because
in fact he is separate from the world. Similarly a person can
realize God by identifying himself with God because he (the
self) has his identity with God.

He who is established in ‘Is’. knows both ‘Is’ and ‘not’; but
he who is established in ‘not’ does not know (perceive) even
‘not’ in its reality as ever non-existent, then how will he know
‘Is’ (the real)? He can’t know. He has no capacity to know
them. He who knows ‘Is’ does not bear ill will with the
person who assumes the existence of ‘not’, but the :person who
"
274,"Verse 70] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 231
assumes the existence of ‘not’ bears ill will with the person
who knows ‘Is’. |

Link:—The world is just like a dark night to the seer. Then
how does he live in the world? The answer to these queries is
provided in the verse that follows.

Just as waters of different rivers enter the ocean, which
though full, remains undisturbed; likewise the man in whom
all enjoyments are merged and attains tranquillity, but not he,
who hankers after such enjoyments. 70 |
Comment:—

‘Apiryamanamacalapratistham samudramapah pravisanti
yadvat'—In the rainy season rivers expand and are flooded by
heavy rain storms. All the rivers continue to pour themselves
into an ocean, but its magnitude remains the same. In summer,
when heat evaporates the water of rivers and these become
narrow with shallow water, even then the expanse of an ocean
remains the same. It is ever full and never seeks water from
streams and rivers. It means, that it ever remains satiated, and
always within Itmits. |

'Tadvatkama* yam pravisanti sarve sa santimapnoti'— A

* Here the term ‘Kama’ has not been used for desires but for the objects of
pleasures which are desired.
"
275,"232 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
self-controlled seer, is like an ocean. He also comes across
worldly enjoyments, but these all merge in him without causing
any perturbation or agitation in his body and mind. Thus,
he attains supreme peace. This peace is not due to mundane
objects, but it emanated from God-realization (Gita 2/46).

In this illustration, the realized soul is compared to an
ocean and the water of the river, is compared to mundane

| objects. Both the water of the ocean and that of the river, are
of the same category. But the realized soul is quite different
in nature. There is a world of difference between the two. The
perfect soul is sentient eternal, real, limitless and endless, while
the enjoyments are insentient, perishable, unreal, limited and
have an end. Secondly, the waters of rivers enter the ocean
and merge in it, but the mundane objects flowing towards the
enlightened soul, do not reach the self, these merely reach his
body and inner sense. Thus the illustration of a river and the
ocean, though 1s not fully applicable here. It only describes the
state of one's body and inner sense. This does not explain the
state of his real self.

""Na kamakami'—Worldly enjoyments and pleasures cannot
satisfy a man, who hankers after them. He can never be satisfied.
He can never be free from desires, anxieties and burning sensation.
So how can he attain peace? The reason is, that ‘the insentient
cannot satisfy the sentient; the sentient can be satisfied only
by sentient. :

Appendix—It is because of one’s desire that this world
appears to be insentient (Matter) but actually it is none other
than the Supreme Soul (Divinity) (God)—‘Vasudevah sarvam’
(Gita 7/19), ‘sadasaccahamarjuna’ (Gita 9/19). When a person
is freed from desires, all objects get pleased with him. How to
know it? We know it. because necessities automatically come
to such a person without any effort. The things are eager to
"
276,"Verse 71] — SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 233
approach him for being fruitful through utilization by him.
But availability or non-availability of objects does not arouse
any morbid feelings in him, because he has no desire. From
his view-point objects have no value (importance). On the
other hand a person having desires, always remains perturbed
(disquiet) whether he receives things or not.

of longings and desires and has no thirst, for acquiring or
preserving even the necessities of life, as he has attained the
supreme bliss, for which the human body was bestowed upon
him. So, he becomes free from all cares and does not mind
even if his body lives or dies. a

In this verse, as well as in the fifty-fifth verse of this
chapter emphasis has been laid on renunciation of desires,
because in the Discipline of Disinterested Action, without
abandoning these no striver can possess steadfast wisdom. A
"
277,"234 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
striver has affinity for the world, only because of desires. If
desires are given up, no affinity for the world remains.

‘Nirmamah'—A man of stable wisdom, has not the least-
sense of mine, with men, things and even his body and _ senses,
because he has received them from the world. Therefore, they
belong to the world, not to him. It is a blunder to have a sense of
possession over things acquired. On rectification of this blunder
the sense of possession over persons, objects, body and sense-
organs is totally wiped out. - .

'Nirahankarah'—'I am this body'—to have this notion is
egoism. The realized soul is, free from the egoism. The body,

: sense-organs, mind and intellect are visible in some light. This

ego is, also perceived in this light. From the view-point of
this light, all these are objects of perception. An onlooker
(seer) is, quite different from the seen—this is the rule. With
this realization, a man of steady wisdom, becomes quite free
from egoism. |

'Sa §antimadhigacchati'—A man of steadfast wisdom attains
peace. It does not mean that he attains peace after being free
from desire, thirst for enjoyment, attachment and egoism. The
fact is that peace is inherent and spontaneous. But a man by
having desires to enjoy worldly pleasures cannot realize that
peace. But, as soon as he becomes free from desire, thirst
for necessities, a sense of mine and egoism, he can realize
that peace. |

In the verse, out of the four—<(desires, thirst for necessities,
the sense of mine and egoism), egoism is more important than the
other three, because a striver after becoming free from egoism,
becomes free from the other three also. If there is no egoism,
how will the sense of mine persist, who will desire and for
whom will he desire? |

Now the question arises, when the renunciation of. desire
"
278,"Verse 71] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI | 235
etc., is also included in the renunciation of egoism, why: has
Lord Krsna described the renunciation of desire separately?
The answer is, that out of these four, desire is gross while
thirst for necessities is subtle; the sense of mine, subtler; and
egoism the subtlest. So, by abandoning desire, it becomes easy |
to abandon the other three. | :

Nothing can be gained merely by desire, what is destined,
we will get. Having such a faith, we should discard desires.
‘sprha' is a subtle form of desire. In the absence of desire
even it persists. It (sprha) is the desire to have bare necessities
of life. In its fulfilment also we are not free. Whatever is
to happen, will happen. Then why should we have ‘sprha'?
When we cease to be dependent on food, water and clothing,
'sprha' is destroyed. After renouncing desires and 'sprha' the
sense Of mind in the body: remains. It is not a rule that
this possessive spirit, preserves articles and these are ruined
without this spirit. Therefore, the possessive spirit serves no
purpose. With renunciation of all the three—desire, 'sprha’ (subtle
desire) and possessive spirit, renunciation of ego, becomes very
easy, otherwise it is very difficult.

From the standpoint of the Discipline of Disinterested
Action: (Karmayoga)—'Nothing is mine; because I have no
independent claim on things, persons, circumstances, incidents :
and situations etc. When nothing is mine, it means that I need
nothing as I need food, water and clothes for the body, only
if it is mine; but if it is not mine, I need nothing for it.

, When there is clear understanding that nothing is mine and |
need nothing, there is no question of egoism (feeling of 'T'),
because egoism persists by accepting affinity for the body,
things and circumstances etc. The fact is that the so-called
body of mine has an affinity for the world, so it should be
"
279,"236 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
used to render service to the world, because J for myself need
nothing. By having this sort of feeling, egoism perishes and
' @ Striver becomes free from egoism and a sense of mine.
From the standpoint of Discipline of Knowledge:—every
man has the knowledge that 'I am’. In 'I am’, I, is a fragment
of nature and ‘am’ denotes ‘reality’ (Eternal Existence). This ‘am'
is used with ‘IT —In the absence of 'T’, 'am’ will not stand, only
‘Is' will remain.’ |
‘I am’, ‘you are’, ‘this is’ and ‘that is'—all these four,
are in respect of individuals, space and time. This is limited
conception. If this limited conception is not maintained, then
universal ‘Is' remains. When a striver is established in this
universal. ‘Is', he becomes completely free from the sense of
T’ and ‘mine’. |
From the standpoint of Discipline of Devotion (Bhaktiyoga)}—
What is called T' or ‘mine’ actually belongs to God, because
had the persons, things, body been mine, I might have protected
them from decay and possessed them forever. But it is not
so. It means that the so-called body of mine, senses, mind,
intellect etc., are His and I am also His. By having this sort |
of feeling, a striver becomes free from the sense of mine and
from egoism. a
Appendix—The Lord by the expression ‘so’ mrtatvaya Kalpate’
(Gita 2/15) explained attainment of perfection by Jnanayoga.
Now by the expression ‘sa Santimadhigacchati’ he mentions the
perfection by Karmayoga. It means that by being established
in Pure-consciousness (Self) immortality is attained and by
renouncing Matter (ego), tranquillity (peace) is attained.
“Egoism’ really does not exist, it is merely assumed in
the self. If it had really existed, we could not have been free
from egoism and the Lord would have also not told us to
be free from egoism. But the Lord mentions ‘nirahankarah’,
"
280,"Verse 71] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 237
so it means that we can be free from egoism. This is also
our experience that the self is free from egoism. In sound
sleep egoism disappears while the self exists—this is clearly
perceived when we arise from sleep. In sound sleep egoism
merges in ‘avidya’ (ignorance), but the self remains. Therefore

_ after arising from sleep (remembering that) we say “I slept so
comfortably that I knew nothing.’’. This memory proves that |
he (the self), who slept comfortably and who knew nothing,
was there. Otherwise who experienced comfort and who knew
nothing? In ‘I knew nothing’ there is no egoism and he who
had this knowledge is the self, free from egoism. —__

A woman’s nose-ring fell into a well. A man got down
into the well in order to search the nose-ring out. He searched
it out and was very pleased. But. at that time he could not
utter any word because voice (an evolute of fire) and water
are opposites. Therefore after coming out of water he could
speak that he had found out the nose-ring. Similarly in
sound sleep at the merger of egoism in ignorance, a man
feels that he enjoyed a carefree sleep but he can’t express it
at that time because there is no means to utter words. After
arising from the sound sleep he has the memory of that joy
(comfort). Memory is born of experience—‘anubhavajanyam
jhanam smrtth’. :

Thus in sound sleep everyone feels that egoism does not
persist but no one feels that the self does not exist. Egoism
can’t persist without us but we (self) can live without egoism
and do live. Our self is consciousness solidified. This eternal

- entity is not dependent on anyone but everyone is dependent
upon it. If we had not been different from egoism, we would
have been only in the form of egoism, then in sound sleep
at the merger of egoism we would have also no existence.
But we exist, it proves that we have our existence without
egoism. In wakefulness and dream, egoism appears and in
"
281,"238 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
sound sleep. egoism merges but we (the self) ever exist. What
neither appears nor merges is our identity.
- Having given up all the desires, for the maintenance of
the body some requirement of things, persons is felt that is
called ‘sprha’ (necessity). Not to talk of the necessities for the
maintenance of the body, the man of steadfast wisdom does
not even need the body because the necessity of the body
makes a man dependent. Necessity is born only when a man
accepts a thing as his own which is not his. A Karmayogi
does not accept anything as his own and for him, but he
regards it as the world’s and for the world. only. So he has
no necessity. | :
‘Kamana’ (desire) and ‘sprha’ (necessity)—renunciation of
both means that there should not be any desire for things and
there should not be any necessity for the maintenance: of the
body. The reason is that the desire for the maintenance of the
body is also enjoyment of pleasure. Not only this but even
the win for peace, salvation and self-realization is ‘Kamana’
(desire). Therefore real disinterestedness consists in not having
desire even for salvation. | oy
In this verse there is prohibition (negation) of ‘Apara
prakrti’ (lower or insentient nature). The ‘Jiva’ (the embodied
soul) because of egoism has sustained ‘Apara _prakrti’
(universe)—‘yayedarn dharyate jagat’ (Gita 7/5). Therefore by
being free from egoism, the.lower nature is negated (affinity
is renounced) and the self (soul) becomes free from the .
bondage of birth and death. If everything is renounced, even
: then egoism remains (persists) but if egoism is renounced,
. everything is renounced. __ |

esa brahmi sthitih partha nainam prapya vimuhyati

sthitvasyamantakale'pi |= brahmanirvanamrcchati

O Partha, such is the state of a God-realized soul. Having
attained this state, he overcomes delusion. Being established in
this state, even at the hour of death, he attains brahmic bliss
(identification with the absolute state). 72 |
Comment:— “

‘Esa brahmi sthitih partha'—This is the Brahmi state viz.,
the state of a God-realized soul. On being free from egoism,
individuality is completely wiped out and then a striver is
automatically established in God. Individuality persisted only
due to affinity with the world. With renunciation of affinity
individuality is completely gone. The term ‘Esa’ refers to ‘very
near’. It denotes the expressions 'vihaya kaman' (giving up desires),
‘nihsprhah' (free from thirst for necessities), ‘nirmamah' (free from
the sense of mine) and ‘nirahankarah' (free from egoism), used
in the preceding verse.

Having heard the Lord's declaration—""When your intellect
transcends the mire of delusion and confusion, by hearing
conflicting doctrines, you will. realize union with God"",
Arjuna was inquisitive to know about that state of union
with God. So Arjuna, raised four questions, in order to know
the marks of a man of steadfast wisdom. Having answered
those four questions, the Lord declares here that this is a
state of Godhood (union with God). In this state of eternal
union with God, no individuality remains, only the Divinity ©
pervades. In order to point out this important fact the Lord
addresses Arjuna as ‘Partha’ here. So
"
283,"240 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
'Nainam prapya vimuhyati'—So long as, a man _ has
egoism (the feeling of 'I') in the body, he is deluded. Lack
of discrimination between the real and the unreal, is delusion.
The man's self being real, if he identifies himself with the
unreal; this identification is delusion. When a striver knows
the unreal as unreal, his affinity to it ceases* and he realizes
that he is already established in the real. With this realization
he is never deluded (Gita 4/35).
""Sthitvasyamantak4le'pi brahmanirvanamrcchati'—The human
body has been bestowed upon man, only for God-realization. So
the Lord gives an opportunity, even to vilest sinner, to attain
Him by establishing himself in Him, even at the time of death
viz., by breaking off his affinity with matter. Lord Krsna has
also anounced it, in the thirtieth verse of the seventh chapter,
“One who knows My integral being, comprising Adhibhuta
(the field of matter), Adhidaiva (Brahma) and Adhiyajiia (the
unmanifest Divinity) even at the time of death, attains Me.""
Similarly, He has also announced in the fifth verse of the
eighth chapter, ""He who departs from this body, thinking of
Me alone, even at the time of death, attains Me; there is no
doubt about it.” |
By the above expression, the Lord declares the glory of
this Brahmi state (Godhood). By being established in this
state, even at the time of death, one attains Brahma. As the
Lord declared about equanimity that even a little practice of
it protects one from great fear (of birth and death) (2/40), so
He declares here that 1f one gets established in this Brahmi
state, even at the time of death by breaking off his affinity
with matter, he attains Brahma. Attachment to matter (non-
* By knowing the unreal as unreal, a man becomes free from it, because in
fact the unreal has no existence. The unreal seems to exist in the light of the real.
If a person does not become free from the unreal even after knowing it as unreal,
it proves that he has not actually known it.
"
284,"Verse 72] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI _ 241
self), is the only obstacle to the attainment of this state. If a
person renounces the attachment, even at the time of death,
he realizes his real axiomatic state of Godhood. |

Now, a question arises, how a man who could not attain
God throughout his life, attains Him at the time of death, when
his body and intellect both grow weak. The answer is that man's
union with Him is natural, only he has to realize this fact* and
this can be realized, either by God's or saints’ grace or by good
influences of past actions.

The word ‘api’ (even) means, that during life if he attains |
a state of Godhood (Brahmi state) he becomes a liberated soul.
| But, even at the time of death if he becomes free from a sense
of mine and egoism, he attains Him immediately without any
sort of practice, meditation and trance etc.

By using the terms 'Brahmanirvanam' (Oneness with Brahma),
Lord Krsna means to say, that the striver of the Discipline
of Disinterested Action (Karmayoga), . attains the same
Brahma as striver of the Discipline of Knowledge (Jianayoga)
(Gita 5/24—26). The same fact has been pointed out, in the
fifth verse of the fifth chapter when he declares, ""The supreme ©
state which is attained by a Sankhyayogi (the follower of the
Discipline of Knowledge), 1s attained also by the Karmayog! (the
follower of the Discipline of Disinterested Action).

—_

Man himself is sentient but he accepts his affinity for
the insentient. Therefore, instead of attaining salvation or
God-realization, he goes to ruin. By using his discrimination
he aims to attain God, while out of delusion he wants to have
affinity to the Matter. : —

Delusion is born of egoism, and a sense of mine or
desire. To accept the body as 'T' or ‘Mine’ is, delusion born |
of egoism, a sense of mine, while the wish to acquire or
"
285,"242 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA - [Chapter2
preserve something, is the delusion born of desire. Arjuna .
like other worldly people, had delusion born of egoism and

~ a sense of mine, as well as desire. In the sentence used in
the first chapter—'We who are righteous persons clearly see
the sin,’ is an example of delusion, born of egoism; ‘These
kinsmen will be destroyed"", is that of delusion born of the
sense of mine and ‘We should not fight otherwise, we shall
incur sin and go to hell’, is that born of desire. :

To remove this delusion, Lord Krsna has talked about two
kinds of discrimination—discrimination between the real and the
unreal (2/11—30) and discrimination between discharging one's
duty and abandoning it (2/31—53).

While discriminating between the body and the soul, Lord
Krsna explained, that there was never a time when he or those
kings were non-existent nor they would cease to exist in future.
It is a fact that these bodies did not exist before, nor will they
exist in future and in the interim also, they are changing every
moment, as every born one passes through babyhood, youth and
old age: He also explained, that as a man discarding worn-out
clothes, takes new. ones, likewise, the embodied soul, casting
off worn-out bodies, enters into others, which.are new. So he
should not grieve.

While explaining discrimination between discharging

: one's duty and abandoning it, He said, ""There is nothing more
welcome for a man of the warrior class, than a righteous war,
which is an open gateway to heaven; if you do not wage it,
you will incur sin. But if you fight treating pleasure and pain,

| gain and loss, victory and defeat, alike, you will not incur sin.
Your right is to perform your duty, but never to its fruit. Let
not the fruit of action, be your object, nor let your attachment
be, to inaction. Therefore, perform your duty being fixed in
Yoga, because equanimity consists in remaining even-minded,
in success and failure. A man who, endowed with equanimity
"
286,"Verse 72] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 243
performs his duty, becomes free from virtues and vices in his
— lifetime. When your intellect transcends the mire of delusion,
and the confusion by hearing conflicting statements, it becomes
poised and firmly fixed, in meditation (on God), you will attain
union with God."" : - |
Appendix—tThe striver devoid of the sense of mine and
egoism gets dissociated from the material world called as ‘Asat
division’ and realizes his natural owner abidance in Brahma
i.e., Sat division. This abidance is known as ‘Brahmi sthiti’.
Having attained this state no owner of this body remains, in
other words there is none who assumes this body as ‘I’ or
‘mine’ and individuality is wiped out. It means that our reality
is not dependent on egoism. Even rid of egoism ever Reality
stands which is called “Brahmi sthiti’ or ‘abidance in Brahma’.
Once this ‘Brahmi sthiti’ (eternal union) is realized, then a man
never gets deluded (Gita 4/35). If even at the time of death,
being free from the sense of mine and egoism, he realizes this
‘Brahmi sthiti’ (state of Godhood), he attains brahmic bliss
(identification with the absolute state) immediately.
By being free from the sense of mine and egoism, Brahma
(the Absolute) or enlightenment is attained. Then a man becomes
free from the sense of mine, from desire and from doership.
The reason is that the embodied soul has sustained the universe
because of egoism—‘ahankaravimidhatma kartahamiti manyate’
_ (Gita 3/27), ‘Jivabhiitaia mahabaho yayedam dharyate jagat’
(Gita 7/5). If he renounces egoism, the universe will not
exist any more. Having attained the Absolute (af he has the
latencies or impressions of devotion), he will know God in —
entirety naturally because the universal soul is the support
of Brahma. . ,
Nothing is mine—by accepting this truth, a man becomes
free from the sense of mine. I need nothing—by accepting this
fact, a man becomes free from the interested motive. I have
"
287,"244 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 2
to do nothing for myself—by. accepting it, a man becomes
free from .egoism. -

Third Chapter |
INTRODUCTION

The teaching of Gita is based on man's experience. While
starting this gospel, (from 2/11), Lord Krsna first of all clarifies
that the body and the soul are totally different from each other.
The body is transitory, unreal, limited and perishable, while the
soul is eternal, real, omnipresent and imperishable. Therefore,
one should neither feel sad at the destruction of the perishable
nor should have a desire to maintain the imperishable—this is

| called discrimination. This discrimination is very essential in
all the three disciplines of Action, Knowledge and Devotion.
When a man discriminates the self from the body, the desire
for salvation is aroused. Not to speak of salvation even the
desire for heaven etc., is aroused, when a man regards his own
self as different from the body. Therefore, the Lord starts His
gospel with discrimination.

This topic of discrimination, begins with the eleventh verse
of the second chapter and continues upto the thirtieth verse.
The Lord, instead of using philosophical terminology, has used
simple terms to enable people to understand the topic easily. It
means, that every person deserves God-realization because the
human body has been bestowed upon us, only to realize Him. So,
every human being can realize God, by giving due importance,
to discrimination. |

For this topic, even the term 'intellect', has not been used
by the Lord. In order to distinguish the real from the unreal,

_ the imperishable from the perishable, the eternal from the
transitory and the soul (spirit) from the body, there is, need
only for discrimination rather than intellect. Discrimination is
beyond intellect. As prakrti (nature) and Purusa (spirit) both
are without beginning (Gita 13/19), so is discrimination, which
"
291,"248 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA | [Chapter3
distinguishes, the real from the unreal. This discrimination has
been bestowed upon all creatures by. God, and it is revealed in
the intellect. Birds and beasts, also know what should or should
not be eaten. Even trees and creepering plants feel hot and cold
and experience favourable and unfavourable circumstances. Human
beings, are specially endowed with this discrimination, which
can release them from the bondage of birth and death and leads
them, to eternal quietude and bliss. _ |

When this discrimination is aroused i.e., when a man can
distinguish between the spirit and the body, his affinity for the
world, including senses, mind and intellect, is renounced and
his intellect, becomes purified and equanimous. -

In the Discipline of Action the resolute intellect is single
(Gita 2/41).* When a man firmly resolves that he has to attain
salvation, favourable or unfavourable circumstances are no obstacle
and thus he attains equanimity, without making any effort.
When a man resolves to attain God-realization, his attachment
and attraction for the world begins to disappear. Attachment to
pleasure and prosperity, is the main obstacle to the attainment
of a resolute intellect (Gita 2/44).

Having laid emphasis on resolute intellect, in the Discipline
of Action, the Lord asks Arjuna, specially to perform his duty
with equanimity. He declares, ""You have a right to action
alone, but never at all to its fruit"" (2/47); ""Perform your duty
being steadfast in Yoga” (2/48) viz., equanimity. The Lord also
declares, ""Far inferior to the Yoga of wisdom, is action"" (2/49)

| i.e., action performed for its fruit, is far inferior to the Yoga of
wisdom (equanimity). He further declares, ""Seek thou refuge

* In the Discipline of Knowledge there is predominance of discrimination,
in the Discipline of Devotion there is predominance of reverence and faith while -
in the Discipline of Action there is predominance of resolute intellect. But it does
not mean that in the Discipline of Action there are no discrimination, reverence
and faith. What it means is that resolute intellect predominates. Similarly in the
Disciplines of Knowledge and Devotion also there is resolute intellect.

in equanimity."" Then He declares, ""Endowed with wisdom
(evenness of mind), one casts off during this life both good
and evil deeds; therefore devote thyself to Yoga; Yoga 1s skill
in action"" (2/50). : = | | /

_ Arjuna had already made up his mind not to fight. So in the
thirty-first verse of the first chapter, he said, ""I do not foresee
any good in slaying my kith and kin."" Then in the forty-fifth
verse, he says, ""What a great sin have we decided to commit,
by preparing ourselves to slay our own people!"" In the fifth
verse of the second chapter, Arjuna says, “It 1s better to live by
begging, than to slay these honoured teachers (elders).” In the third
verse of the second chapter, Lord Krsna directs Arjuna to arise,
shaking off his petty faint-heartedness, while Arjuna declared his
determination not to fight in the ninth verse of the second chapter.
_ Listener cannot understand what a preacher preaches, if he is
already full of prejudice. That is why, Arjuna could not have a
thorough grasp of the topic explained to him, by Lord Krsna.

He could not make out the real meaning of Lord Krsna's
words. These appeared to him to be ambiguous and confusing.
So Arjuna puts questions to Lord Krsna in the next two verses,
in order to get his doubt cleared. |

_ If you think that knowledge is superior to action, O Janardana

KeSava (Krsna)? With your complex words You seem to bewilder

may attain the highest good. 1-2
Comment:—

__ ‘Janardana'—By this term Arjuna means to suggest, that as
God fulfils desires of His devotees He will undoubtedly fulfil
his desire also. _ a |

‘Jyayasi cetkarmanaste mata buddhirjanardana _tatkim
karmani ghore mam niyojayasi keSava'—Its a common human
: weakness, that one puts queries to others with a view to getting
a response, which would support his own views. It is cowardice,
because valour consists in carrying out the instructions of the
preacher whether these are, favourable or hostile. It is because
of this weakness or cowardice, that he experiences difficulty in
, unfavourable circumstances. When he finds himself unable to
face the unfavourable circumstances, he disguises himself as a
good man 1.e., the evil masquerades itself as a virtue. It is very
difficult to renounce this sort of evil. In the case of Arjuna also,
the evil of the renunciation of his duty has disguised itself as a
virtue of non-violence. So, he regards knowledge as superior to
action and’ asks Lord Krsna, why he urges him to do a savage
deed, of fighting. _

- The Lord, in the thirty-ninth verse of the second chapter,
referred to equanimity (evenness of mind), but Arjuna took it to
be, knowledge. Therefore, he tells the Lord, that He had already
told him, ""This, which has been taught to thee, is wisdom
concerning Sankhyayoga (Discipline of Knowledge); but now
listen to wisdom concerning Karmayoga (Discipline of Action);
endowed with which, thou shalt cast off the bondage of action.""
He had also told him, ""Action is far inferior to the Discipline of
"
294,"Verse 1-2] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 251
Wisdom (Knowledge)"" (2/49). Thus, if according to the Lord,
knowledge is superior to action, He should not urge him to be
engaged, even in virtuous actions such as oblation, charity and
penance etc., which are sanctioned by scripture. But still, He is
urging him to do the savage deed of the slaughter of warriors,
in the war. Why? a

First, Arjuna, filled with enthusiasm, ordered Lord Krsna
to place his chariot between the two armies so that he could
observe the warriors, eager for battle. But, when Lord Krsna,

having placed the chariot between the two armies, in front of
Bhisma and Drona and other kings, asked Arjuna to behold those
Kurus assembled there, his delusion, because of his attachment
to his kinsmen, was aroused. So he thought, knowledge to be
superior to action, as in the case of knowledge a man has not
to perform such savage deeds as the slaughter of warriors in a
war. So Arjuna asks Lord Krsna, why he urges him to perform
such a savage deed. , :

Here the term ‘'Buddhth’ has been taken in the sense of
knowledge, otherwise he would not have put this question. If
Arjuna had understood ‘equanimity’ by the term 'Buddhih’, then
the Lord's statement would have not appeared as confusing.
The reason is, that the Lord, in the forty-eighth verse of the

- second chapter, had already asked him to perform action being
steadfast in equanimity. Using the term ‘confusing words' will
be purposeful only, when there might have been two contentions
in the mind of Arjuna and only then this question might arise,
""If you consider knowledge superior to action, then why do you
urge Me to take savage action?"" In the third chapter in response
to Arjuna's question, Lord Krsna declares, that in this world
there are two disciplines—the Discipline of Knowledge and the
Discipline of Action. It means, that Arjuna took the meaning of
the term ‘'Buddhih’', to be knowledge.

A striver can receive the correct answer to his question,
"
295,"252 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
only if he puts it with faith and reverence. Arjuna has full faith
in Lord Krsna and holds him in great reverence. Therefore, his
question shows, that he is even prepared to perform the savage
deed of fighting, in order to attain salvation. .

""Vyamisreneva vakyena buddhirn mohayasiva me'—Arjuna says,
that. sometimes he asks him to perform his duty (2/48) while

‘another time He asks him to seek refuge in knowledge (2/49).
Thus, with an seemingly mixed words, He seems to bewilder his
mind i.e., Arjuna is not able to understand whether he should
perform his duty or take refuge in knowledge.

Here, the use of the term ‘eva’ (as it were) two times,

| . shows Arjuna's reverence for Lord Krsna. It is because of this
reverence for the Lord, that he regards the utterance of the Lord

as true, thinking that He is not confusing him. But because of

his own lack of understanding, the Lord's utterance seems to

him to be perplexing and it bewilders his mind. Had the Lord

‘in fact bewildered his mind, then who would have removed
his delusion? |
- ‘Yadekam vada niscitya yena Sreyo'hamapnuyam'—Arjuna

_ requests Lord Krsna to tell him decisively, one principle either
.of action or of knowledge, by which he may attain the highest

good or bliss. Arjuna is repeating the same request which he had
already mentioned, ""Tell me decisively what is good for me (2/7).
- Appendix—So long as we accept (assume) the existence of
the world, an action seems dreadful or pleasant. The reason is
that by cognising the entity of the world, we have our eye on

an action rather than on our duty. But when we mind our duty,
_ ‘the action does not seem dreadful or pleasant.

: Link:—The Lord, in the next three (third, fourth and
fifth) verses, answers the complex words said, in the first
two verses.

The blessed Lord said:

O sinless Arjuna, in this world to achieve equanimity a twofold
path has been enunciated by Me before, the path of Knowledge,
for men of renunciation (Sankhyayogi), and the path of Action,
for men of action (Karmayog!). 3
Comment:—

[Arjuna did not want to fight. So he misunderstood the
term 'Buddhi' (intellect), which stands for equanimity but he
took it to mean knowledge. But the Lord had already used the
terms 'Buddhi' and 'Buddhiyoga' for equanimity (2/39, 49 etc.)
Therefore, here also Lord Krsna is describing equanimity
which can be acquired by both the Disciplines of Knowledge
and Action.]

'Anagha'—The question put by Aquna, how to attain on the
highest good or bliss, shows his freedom from sin, because the
keen desire to attain bliss, destroys all the sins of a striver.

'Loke'smindvividha nistha pura proktaé maya'—Here, the
term 'loke’' denotes human body, because both the Disciplines of
Knowledge and Action can be practised, only in human hie.

The term 'Nistha’ stands for equanimity, which can be attained
either through the Discipline of Knowledge or the Discipline of ,
Action. In order to distinguish the two, the Lord, in the thirty-
ninth verse of the second chapter, declared, ""This is equanimity
concerning Sankhya, which has been taught to you (from the
eleventh to the thirtieth verses). Now listen about equanimity
"
297,"254 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 3
concerning Yoga (Discipline of Action) (from the thirty-ninth
to the fifty-third verses)."" - | : :

The term ‘pura’ also denotes ""time immemorial"", as well as,
the immediate past. Here it has been used in the latter sense L.e.,
in the preceding chapter, when doubt arose in Arjuna’s mind.
In both the disciplines which have already been described in
the preceding chapter, there is no mention of the renunciation
of actions.

Here, Lord Krsna has mentioned two disciplines—the
Discipline of Sankhya (Knowledge) and the Discipline of Yoga

, (Action). Corresponding to the two types of Disciplines there

are two types of ‘purusas’, in this world (Gita 15/16). These are,
the perishable (mortal world) and the imperishable (immortal
self). To remain equanimous in success and failure, gain and
loss of the perishable is known as the Discipline of Action,
while having a disinclination for the perishable and being
established in the imperishable is the Discipline of Knowledge.
But above these two there is the Supreme Person who is beyond
the perishable, and is superior to the imperishable, as described
in the scriptures, and the Veda (15/18). Thus a wholehearted
surrender to the Lord, is called the Discipline of Devotion.
Therefore, in the Discipline of Action there is predominance of the
perishable, in the Discipline of Knowledge there is predominance
of the imperishable, while in the Discipline of Devotion there is
predominance of God (Supreme Person).*

The state of 'nistha’ (equanimity), can be attained by strivers,
either through knowledge or through Action, but identification

* In fact in both Karmayoga and Jijanayoga our relation with God remains
established. God Himself has prescribed these disciplines (Yogas), forthe salvation
of man. The strivers following these two disciplines carry out the rules prescribed
by God. The only thing is that the striver following these two disciplines does not
totally depend upon God.
"
298,"Verse 3] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 255
with the Lord, is not their own (nistha). In Sankhya state strivers
experience distinctly, the existence of their own selves, as well
as, that of the world and try to cut asunder the affinity for the
world. A Karmayog! offers to the world, everything (including
even his body), that he has derived from it and removes affinity
from the world. In this way, both of them get established in
their true form—the Self. But in the state of wholehearted
surrender to God, a striver in the beginning, does not feel the
existence of God, but he believes that there exists something
unique (God) which is above and apart from the Self, as well
as, the world. Thus he accepts God with a firm belief and faith
and dedicates himself to Him. Therefore, in Sankhya and Yoga,
there is predominance of ‘knowing’ whereas, ‘accepting’ (Faith)
is of much import in Bhagavannistha. :

There is no difference between 'knowing' and ‘accepting’.
‘Accepting’ is equally indubitable (firm) as ‘knowing’. There
is no scope for a debate for an accepted thing. A child takes
its mother to be its own. No doubt ever crops up in its mind.
Therefore, mm Gita, wherever the term ‘knowing’ has been used
with reference to Bhaktiyoga, it should be taken as ‘accepting’.
Similarly, in connection with Jnanayoga and Karmayoga, the
term ‘accepting’ should be taken to mean ‘knowing’. :

The state of equanimity depends on the disciplines of the
Jnanayogi and Karmayogi, but in Bhagavannistha the devotee
depends entirely, on the grace of God. |

The Discipline of Devotion has been described in the
Gita time and again. In this chapter also, the Lord having
described the Disciplines of Knowledge and Action, explains,
the Discipline of Devotion in the thirtieth verse, by declaring,
""Surrender all actions to Me."" Similarly, in the fifth chapter
also, having described the two Disciplines, in the tenth verse,
He declares, ""The knower of Truth performs actions offering
these to God,"" while, at the end of the chapter, He declares
"
299,"256 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
that He is the enjoyer of sacrifices and austerities and so on.

‘Ji€nayogena sankhyanam'—These are modes of nature,
(prakrti), which act on the modes (Gita 3/28) and so a striver,
is not related to them. Thus, by thinking so, when a striver
renounces the agency of doership in all actions it is known as,
the Discipline of Knowledge (Jnanayoga). : :

_ At the beginning of the gospel of the Gita while describing
Sankhyayoga (the Discipline of Knowledge), the Lord clarifies,
the imperishable self from the perishable body, by terming these
as ‘sat’ (real) and ‘asat' (unreal) (Gita 2/16). _

'Karmayogena yoginam'—The Discipline of Action, consists
in performing one's duty according to one's caste, stage of life,
nature, circumstances, according to the ordinance of the scriptures,
renouncing attachment to it and desire for its fruit, and remaining
equanimous in success and failure. '

The Lord has primarily described the Discipline of Action, in
the forty-seventh and forty-eighth verses of the second chapter.
In the forty-seventh verse, there is mention of the principle of
the Discipline of Action, while in the forty-eighth verse, there
is description of the method of performing action.

Appendix—Karmayoga and Jnanayoga—These two paths
being in the world are worldly—‘loke’smindvividha nistha’.
In Karmayoga there is predominance of ‘Ksara’ (perishable)
(world) while in Jnanayoga there is predominance of ‘Aksara’
(embodied soul) (imperishable).. The perishable and the
imperishable also are there in the world only—‘dvavimau purusau
loke ksarasScaksara eva ca’ (Gita 15/16). Therefore Karmayoga |
and Jnanayoga—both are worldly paths.

By attaching importance to the soul (Self) and the world—
there are two paths. If without attaching importance to the soul
and the world, importance is attached only to God, there are
not two paths but there is only one unworldly path of
‘Bhagavannistha’ (devotion).
"
300,"Verse 4] : SADHAKA-SANJIVANT. 257
In worldly paths (Karmayoga-Jnanayoga) a striver’s endeavour
is important. In practising. the spiritual discipline a striver
holds that his effort is predominant. But when a striver practises
spiritual discipline by depending on God without considering his
effort as dominant, then his path is unworldly (divine). The reason
is that by being connected with God all becomes unworldly.
Unless and until there is affinity for God, all is worldly.

- Neither think others as evil doers, nor wish evil to others
nor do evil to others—with this outlook “Karmayoga’ begins.
Nothing is mine, I need nothing and I have to do nothing for
myself—by accepting this truth ‘Jnanayoga’ begins.

Not by non-performance of actions, does a man attain freedom
from the bondage of actions; nor by mere renunciation, does he
attain perfection. 4 |
Comment:— | |

'Na karmanamanarambhannaiskarmyam puruso'snute’'—
In the Discipline of Action, performance of action 1s inevitable,
because for a sage who wishes to attain success in Yoga, action
is the means (6/3).* ,

A man has an impulse for action, which can be pacified
by the performance of actions, without having any desire for
fruits. If a striver performs actions having a desire for fruits,
this impulse is not pacified, it is rather enhanced.

‘Naiskarmyam asnute'—When a striver performs his duty, |

* If he does not perform action, how will he come to know whether he
remained equanimous in success and failure or not? :
"
301,"258 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
without any desire for fruit, he attains to the state of actionlessness
1.e., he is released from the bondage of action. Such actions do
not bear fruit, in the same way as a roasted or boiled seed loses
its potence to sprout. Such actions lose their power of involving
a man, in the bondage of birth and death. oe

A man can renounce desire, when he perform actions only
for the welfare of others, as actions have affinity for the world,
while the affinity of self is, for God. So long as he performs
actions for himself, he cannot renounce desire and as long as
he does not renounce desire, he cannot attain to the state of
actionlessness. |

| ""Na ca sannyasanadeva siddhim samadhigacchati'— In the first
half of this verse, the Lord has declared that a Karmayogi does not
attain the state of actionlessness by non-performance ‘of actions.
In the second half, He declares that a Sankhyayogi (a follower
of the Discipline of Knowledge) does not attain perfection viz.,
a state of actionlessness by mere renunciation of action.

It is necessary for a striver to renounce the sense of doership,
in order to attain perfection. So a Sankhyayogi (follower of the
Discipline of Knowledge) instead of renouncing the performance
of action, must renounce egoism. |

In Sankhyayoga, actions can be performed and they can also
be renounced to a certain extent, but in Karmayoga (Discipline
of Action), action is necessary as, it is the means to attain success
in Yoga viz., perfection (Gita 6/3). :

The Gita, teaches a man, how to attain spiritual perfection by
performing one’s duty. It inspires him to perform actions, rather
than to renounce them. So the Lord lays emphasis, on performing
actions, in both the Disciplines of Action and Knowledge.

It is natural that when a striver aims at salvation, he gets
tired of the worldly affairs and wants to renounce those affairs.
"
302,"Verse 4] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI — 259
Similarly, Arjuna also being tired of actions, asks Lord Krsna why
He is urging him to be engaged in this terrible action of waging

__ war, when both the Disciplines of Action and Knowledge lead
to equanimity. But the Lord, orders Arjuna to perform actions in
both the Disciplines. By the Discipline of Action, He orders him
to perform action by being even-minded (Gita 2/48), while in
the Discipline of Knowledge He orders him to fight (Gita 2/18).
Therefore, the Lord urges people to perform actions rather than
to renounce these. But the Lord asks them to renounce desire
and attachment which are like poison, in actions. —

A striver instead of renouncing the performance of actions,
should renounce his attachment to them. Yogis (men of action),
having abandoned attachment, perform actions only by the body,
mind, intellect or merely by the senses, in order to render service to
the world, without any selfish motive (Gita 5/11). In the Discipline
of Knowledge, there is predominance of discrimination, between
the real and the unreal. Therefore, a Jfianayogi assumes that it
is modes which are acting on the modes 1.e., all the actions are
performed by the body, senses, mind and intellect etc., while he
does nothing at all (Gita 3/28, 5/8-9).

All strivers experience that as soon as, a keen desire for
salvation 1s aroused in them, they have disinclination for actions,
things and persons (members of the family). But being attached
to a body, they have a desire for rest, which is an obstacle to
their progress. Generally, strivers believe, that they can progress
in the spiritual field by renouncing actions, things and company
of people. But the fact is, that renouncement of attachment to
actions, things and people is an important factor. In the Discipline
of Knowledge, it is difficult to renounce attachment, without
keen dispassion. But in the Discipline of Action, attachment is
easily renounced, by performing actions for others, even without |
keen dispassion.

In the Gita, it is also mentioned that a striver may practise
"
303,"260 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
spiritual discipline in solitude. But in solitude, a sattvika (virtuous)
person devotes his time, in being busy with spiritual practice and
adoration, a rajasa (passionate) person spends it in projections
and distractions, while a tamasa (ignorant) man, wastes it in
sleep, indolence and heedlessness. Therefore, a striver should
have an inclination to dwell in solitude, in order to devote his
time and energy to spiritual activities, but he should perform his
mundane duty also, very promptly without being attached to it. He
should be attached, neither to people nor to inaction. Detachment
leads a striver to salvation very quickly. In fact external solitude
is ‘not the real solitude, because the body is also a fragment
of the world. Therefore, real solitude consists in renouncing
affinity with the body and the world i.e., in renouncing egoism
and attachment.

Appendix—The divinity which is ours, is in us and is now, is
not realized by doing something because that 1s never unattained.
We shall do some action, then that reality will be realized—this
conception strengthens identification of the self with the body.
Every action has a beginning and an end, therefore by action
only the thing will be gained which does not really exist. But
because of affinity for Prakrti in every being, there is an inner
urge for actions which does not enable him to be actionless. In
order to pacify this urge, it is inevitable not to do what ought
not to be done, and do without the sense of mine and with
disinterest what ought to be done viz., not to do any action for
oneself but do only for the welfare of others. By doing actions
for oneself, the impetus for actions will never end because
the self is eternal while actions are transitory. Therefore by
performing actions selflessly for the welfare of others, the urge
for actions calms down, affinity for Prakrti gets renounced
and God, Who pervades everywhere and every time will be
revealed and realized.

na hi kascitksanamapi jatu tisthatyakarmakrt
karyate hyavasah karma sarvah prakrtijairgunaih
For, no one under any circumstances can remain even for a

moment, without undertaking action; everyone is compelled to act,

by the modes born of nature (prakrti). 5

Comment:—

'Na hi kaScitksanamapi jatu tisthatyakarmakrt'—In the
Disciplines of Action, Knowledge and Devotion, no striver can
ever remain without performing actions. Hence the terms 'Kascit'
(anyone), 'ksanam' (a moment) and ‘jatu' (verily) are uncommon.
Here, the term 'kaScit' denotes, that no one whether he is wise or
ignorant, can remain without performing action. Though a wise
man may have no relation with his so-called body, yet actions
are constantly performed by it. The term ‘ksanam' denotes, that a
man does not assume that he performs actions constantly, but he
cannot remain without performing action, even for a moment, so
long as he assumes his affinity for the body. The term ‘jatu’ means
that a man cannot remain without performing action, in any state
such as wakefulness, sleep, sound sleep and unconsciousness.
The Lord explains the reason by the term 'avagah' (helplessly)
in the second half of the verse, by declaring that he has to act
helplessly by impulses born of nature. Nature is ever changeful.
A striver has to do nothing for himself. He has to perform actions
sanctioned by the scriptures, for the welfare of others. So far as
forbidden actions are concerned, they cannot be performed by a
striver, because his aim 1s God-realization.

Many people regard, only those actions as actions, which
are performed by the gross body. But according to the Gita, the
activities undertaken by the body, speech or mind are also regarded
as actions (Gita 18/15). And those actions, whether physical or
"
305,"262 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
mental to which a man is attached, lead him to bondage.

Generally, people regard their professions, such as business,
service or teaching and nursing of children etc., as actions, but they
do not consider eating, drinking, sleeping, waking and thinking
etc., as actions. So, when they renounce their profession, they
think that they are not performing actions. But it is a serious error
on their part. All the activities performed by the physical body,
for the purpose of earning a living, actions performed by the
subtle body like sleeping and thinking and in trance, performed
by the causal body, are all regarded as actions. So long as, a
man has ego and sense of mineness with the body, the activities

| performed by body are actions as the body is an evolute of
nature and nature is never inactive. So, a person having egoism
and attachment to the body, cannot remain without performing
action, in either of the states, either of activity or inactivity.

""Karyate hyavaSah karma sarvah prakrtijairgunaih'— Everyone
is made to act helplessly, by the modes of nature (prakrti)
because nature and its modes are ever active (Gita 3/27, 13/29).
Though, the soul is inactive, detached, imperishable, uniform
and unconnected, yet so long as, it being attached to nature
and its evolute—the gross, subtle and causal bodies wants to
derive pleasure and remains helpless under the control of nature
(Gita 14/5). This helplessness of the self, under the control of
nature, is due to affinity with nature. This has also been mentioned,
in the eighth verse of the ninth chapter and the nineteenth verse
of the eighth chapter..

Individual nature is moulded by tendencies and tendencies
are born of modes and modes in their term evolve from prakrti.
Therefore, to be subjected to nature or modes or prakrti is one
and the same thing. As a matter of fact, subjection to the prakrti
and its evolutes, is the root-cause of all bondage. The same,
on different occasions, has been defined as subjection to time,
nature, action and prakrti etc. So long as, the self (soul) does
"
306,"Verse 5] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI . 263
not become free from nature and its modes i.e., does not realize
God, it remains helpless under the control of modes, time, nature,
pleasures and even persons, property etc. But when it transcends
the modes of nature and realizes the self or God, it does not
remain helpless, it attains freedom which is axiomatic.

There are two states of prakrti—active (gross) and inactive
(subtle). Performance of action, is the active state, while remaining
idle in sleep etc., is the inactive state. But, even in the inactive
state nature does not remain inactive, and activity goes on, in its
subtle form. When a person is awakened by someone, he says
that he was aroused, in half sleep. This proves, that the process
of sleep continued even, in the inactive state. In the same way,
activity continues in a trance, dissolution (pralaya) and final
dissolution etc., in its subtle form.

In fact nature never remains inactive because it is ever-
changing. In the self (spirit or soul) there is no doership, but
having assumed Its affinity for bodies etc., the evolutes of nature,
It becomes helpless, under the control of nature. It is because
of helplessness, that though, being a non-doer, assumes Itself,
as doer. All the actions of the universe, such as seeing, hearing,
breathing, digestion of food etc., are performed by nature. So is
the case with the states of childhood and youth. But the embodied
soul, is bound by regarding itself as the doer of some actions.

Nature constantly undergoes changes, while in the purer self
there 1s never any change. In fact, the worldly things have no
existence of their own. The kaleidoscopic heap, seems to exist in |
the form of things. When a man assumes his affinity for things,
he cannot remain without performing actions, even for a moment
in any state. If a striver realizes that all the activities are confined
to the things and he has not the least relation with them, then
only can he get rid of his helplessness. A Karmayogi (follower |
"
307,"264 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
of the Discipline of Action) gets rid of this helplessness by
renouncing the desire and attachment to the ever-changing things.

Whatever has been said, by the Lord here in‘this verse, has
also been said, in the eleventh verse of the eighteenth chapter
when He declares, ""It is indeed impossible for an embodied
being, to abstain from actions altogether.""

Appendix—All actions are performed only in Prakrti. But
a man by accepting his identity with nature (prakrti) becomes
dependent on the modes of nature—‘avasah’ and he’ gets
contaminated by actions. Therefore no person who assumes
his affinity with nature, under any circumstances, can remain
even for a moment without undertaking action in any state
as wakefulness, sleep, sound sleep, faint, trance, creation-new
creation, dissolution and final dissolution etc.

How is an action performed in the states of sound sleep,
faint and trance? When a man sleeps and any person awakes him
in between, he says that he was awakened without having a full

| (complete) sleep. It proves that at the time of sleep, the action
from incompletion to completion was going on. Similarly in faint
and trance also an action goes on. In Patanjala Yogadarsana this
action has been called ‘parinama’.* Parinama means current of
variation viz., flow of change.T It means that from the beginning
of trance to the state of relapse, an action goes on. If there is
no action, there can’t be relapse from the state of trance. At

“What is ‘parinama’?—the change of the state from the original (existing)
one to the other new one is ‘parinama’.

(Yogadarsana Vibhiti 13, Vyasa Bhasya)
"
308,"Verse 6] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 265 :
the time of trance there is ‘parinama’.and at the end of trance
there is relapse. ,

‘Sahajavastha’ or ‘Sahaja Samadhi’ (natural state of self-
realization) transcends all states of Prakrti. In it there is no action
in the least, an action is not possible. Therefore in Sahajavastha
there is neither ‘parinama’ (current of change) nor vyutthana
(relapse). The reason 1s that activities take place only in Prakrti
and its evolutes, never in the self. ‘Karyate hyavasah karma’—-We
are helplessly driven to action, but we are quite free in having
or not having attachment or aversion for them.

| Link:— In the fifth verse, it has been mentioned that no one
can remain without action for a moment, even, one may object
to these that a person could regard himself as free from action,
by forcibly suspending the functions of the senses. The answer

He who while, restraining the organs of action, thinks of sense-
objects in his mind, he, of deluded understanding is a hypocrite. 6
Comment:— — | |

""Karmendriyani samyamya ya aste manasa smaran indriyarthan-
vimiidhatma mithyacarah sa ucyate'— Here the term 'Karmendriyani'
does not stand only for the five organs of action (speech, hand,
foot, anus and generative organ) but also stands for the five sense-
organs (ear, skin, eye, taste and nose) because actions cannot be |
performed by the organs of action alone without sense-organs.
Besides this if only the organs of action such as hand and foot
etc., are restrained but the sense-organs such as ear and eye are
"
309,"266 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
not restrained hypocrisy is not fully proved. — |

In the Gita, sense-organs have also been included within the
organs of action.Therefore, in the Gita only the term 'Karmendrtya’
rather than 'Jianendriya’ has been used. In the eighth and ninth
verses of the fifth chapter the actions of the sense-organs such
as seeing, hearing and touching etc., have also been innumerated
along with actions of the organs of action. It proves, that in the
Gita, the sense-organs are also included, in the organs of action.
According to the Gita, the activities performed with the mind,
are also included in actions (Gita 18/15). It means, that every
evolute of nature 1s active, because nature is ever-active.

Though the term 'sarnyamya’ means full control over senses,
yet here it signifies, only their outward restraint. The reason
is, that he who has completely controlled his senses, cannot be
called a hypocrite.

A man of foolish understanding (who cannot distinguish the
real, from the unreal) restrains the senses forcibly, from running
after sense-objects but thinks of the objects of enjoyment, with
his mind and assumes this state, as actionless. Such a person is
called a hypocrite. The reason is, that outwardly he has restrained
the organs and senses, but because of egoism, attachment and
desire, he performs action by enjoying pleasure, while thinking
of the objects of enjoyment.

Worldly pleasures can be enjoyed externally, as well as
internally. As external pleasures leave their influence, so do
the internal ones, which are enjoyed by thinking of the objects
of enjoyment viz., by being attached to them. External pleasures
can be renounced by applying discrimination, thinking of adverse
consequences or to maintain social decorum. But, there is no such
obstacle, in the enjoyment of internal pleasures. A person goes
on enjoying these with his mind, and develops a false pride that
he has renounced these pleasures. Thus, internal pleasures prove
very fatal for him. Therefore, a striver should very carefully
"
310,"Verse 6] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 267
restrain his mind from thinking of the objects of enjoyment.

Arjuna also wants to renounce the performance of actions, and
asks Lord Krsna why He urges him to engage in the terrible deed.
In response to his question the Lord replies, that a person who,
having renounced the actions externally, has egoism, attachment
and desire etc., but thinks that he is not performing any action,
is a hypocrite. It means that striver instead of renouncing the
performance of actions, should perform them promptly, renouncing
desire and attachment. _ oo

Appendix—Worldly pleasures can be enjoyed externally as
well as internally by mind. Enjoyment of pleasures physically
and relishing them by thinking of sense-objects—there is no
difference between the two.

The same impression is made by dwelling on sense-objects
in the mind as it is made by physical enjoyment of pleasures.
If one relishes the memory of pleasures, then several years may
pass but that pleasure remains the same (fresh). Therefore the
thought of pleasure gives birth to a new pleasure. Not only this
but relish of pleasures, by thinking of them, causes greater harm.
The reason is that a man can renounce external pleasures in order
to escape adverse public opinion and to maintain social decorum,
but in the enjoyment of pleasures with the mind there is no such
external obstacle. Therefore a man gets a good chance to enjoy
them with the mind. So relishing pleasures with the mind is very
harmful for a striver. In fact renunciation of pleasures mentally
is the real renunciation (Gita 2/64).

DOSES I

Link:—In the fourth verse, the Lord laid emphasis on the
performance of actions, in both the Disciplines of Action and
Knowledge. In the fifth verse, He declared, ""No one can remain
even for a moment without performing action."" In the sixth verse,
He said, ""He who, restraining the organs of actions forcibly
"
311,"268 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
regards himself as actionless, is a hypocrite."" It means that
renunciation of actions, is not true renunciation. Therefore, He
in the next verse explains the marks of real renunciation.

Comment:—

{The term 'tu' (but) has been used in order to declare that such
a follower of the Discipline of Action, free from attachment, is
superior, not only to a hypocrite, but also to a follower of the
Discipline of Knowledge.] 7

'Arjuna'—The term ‘Arjuna’ means, pure in nature. The Lord
addressing him as Arjuna, says that being pure in nature, he
should have no doubt about the performance of his duty.

'Yastvindriyani manasa niyamya'—-Here the term 'Manasa,
stands for all the inner senses—(mind, intellect, faculty of reflection
and ego) and the term ‘Indriyani’ denotes, all the ten organs of
action and sense-organs. ‘Controlling the senses by the mind’
means that by applying discrimination a striver should realize
that the self has no affinity for the senses and the mind. When
the senses are controlled by the mind, these can be engaged in
or deviated from, any activity as the striver wishes.

Senses are controlled, only when attachment to them is -
renounced totally. In the eleventh verse of the twelfth chapter
also, there is mention of control over senses for a Karmayogi.
It means that a striver can follow the path of action, only by
controlling the senses.
"
312,"Verse 7] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 269
In the preceding (sixth) verse Lord Krsna talked, about a
hypocrite who forcibly restrains his senses, while here in this
verse He is talking of, preventing the senses from indulging
in forbidden actions and engaging these in actions, which are
sanctioned by scriptures. When actions are performed according to
the scriptural injunctions, senses are automatically controlled.

‘Asaktah’'—A man is attached to (1) actions, and (ii) their fruit.
It is attachment, and not actions or their fruit, that is the root of
all evils. Attachment is the main stumbling block to perfection.
So a Striver instead of renouncing actions, should renounce
attachment. He can be free from attachment, when he, without
regarding the body, senses, mind and intellect as his or for him,
starts performing his duty promptly for the welfare of the world,
by considering these of the world and for the world. By doing
so, his attachment to the fruit of actions automatically perishes.

All actions, including thinking and trance, have nothing
to do with the self (Gita 5/11). Though the self is naturally
unattached, yet by developing attachment, it gets attached to the
world. The real merit of a Karmayogi consists in being free from
attachment. Freedom from attachment means, having no desire
for the fruit of actions.

A common man performs actions in order to fulfil his
desire, while a striver performs actions having the aim of
renouncing attachment. Such a striver is called here an
‘Asaktah' (unattached).

A striver following the path of action, can renounce attachment
and desire for fruit, more easily than the striver, who follows
the path of knowledge. A Karmayogi, only through disinterested
actions without any other means, can be free from attachment
and desire for fruit, while a Jnanayogi, in order to do away with
his sense of egoism and attachment, has to follow the path of
action i.e., he has to perform actions without, having any desire
for fruit (5/6, 15/11). The reason is, that unless dispassion 1s
"
313,"270 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3

developed and body consciousness is removed, Sankhyayoga
is difficult to practise, without having practised Karmayoga
beforehand. Through the practice of Karmayoga a Sankhyayogi
gets completely detached, and then through the practice of
Jnanayoga, he attains perfection. As soon as a Karmayogi
renounces attachment, he attains equanimity.Therefore, the Lord
declares, that actions need not be renounced but these should
be performed, without attachment. It is attachment, which needs
to be renounced. In Karmayoga (Discipline of Action), action is
performed for the welfare of others, while 'Yoga’ (union) is for
one's own self. Arjuna considers action in relation to himself,
therefore, he thinks that fighting is a terrible act. So the Lord
clarifies, that it is attachment to action, rather than action, by
itself, which is terrible. .

‘Karmendriyaih karmayogam arabhate'—As the term ‘Indriyani'
stands for all the ten senses, so does the term, 'Karmendriyaih'
denote the ten senses. If they are taken as the five organs of action
alone, such as hand, foot and speech etc., how could actions be
performed without seeing, hearing and thinking? Therefore, all
the internal and external senses and organs, by which actions
are performed, are included in 'Karmendriyaih.' :

When an action is performed, for the welfare of others
without any selfish motive, it is called ‘Karmayoga'’ or the
Discipline (Path) of Action. When a person performs actions
for himself, he is attached to the actions and their fruit. But,
when he performs these for others, actions and their fruit are
related to others, while he is related to God i.e., he realizes his
real relation with God, the eternal. Thus, performance of one's
duty according to one's caste and circumstances etc., selflessly,
is the beginning of Karmayoga (Discipline of Action). —

Strivers following the Discipline of Action are of two
types:—(i) Those who are interested in performing actions, but
their main aim is to attain salvation. Such strivers need not start
"
314,"Verse 7] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI - 271
new actions. They have to make proper use of the available
circumstances. (11) Those who are more interested in rendering
service to others, in providing comfort to others and in improving
the society, than in their attainment of salvation. Such strivers,
can start performing new actions, with the aim of doing away
with their attachment. oe | :

In the Gita, Lord Krsna asks Arjuna to make a proper
use of available circumstances, because Arjuna had a keen
desire to attain the highest good i., to attain bliss or
salvation (Gita 2/7; 3/2; 5/1).

'Sa visisyate'-—He, who performs actions for the welfare of
others, having renounced his selfishness and fruit for action, is
superior as his all actions are directed towards the service of the —
world, All his possessions and body are also, for the service of
others. His selflessness is of such a degree that his ego (of the
sense of rendering service), is completely annihilated. Thus he
becomes totally detached and liberated.

When a striver resolves to attain salvation, he wants to
renounce actions, by regarding these as stumbling blocks to
salvation. But the fact is, that it is not the action but it is the
selfish motive in the performance of actions, which is an obstacle.
Therefore, the Lord declares that a person, who without attachment
performs action for the welfare of others, is superior to those
hypocrites, who restrain the organs of action but have the sense-
objects in mind. Even a person who performs action in order to
receive its reward, such as heaven etc., is superior to a hypocrite.
Then, there is no doubt that a Karmayogi who performs actions
for the welfare of others without having any selfish motive, is
superior. At the beginning of the fifth chapter, Arjuna asks Lord
Krsna to tell him for certain which one of the two, Sannydsa or
Yoga (renunciation of actions or their unselfish performance) is
better. Lord Krsna replies that both lead to salvation, but unselfish
performance of action is better, than its renunciation. Similarly,
"
315,"272 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
here also he declares a Karmayogi, who performs actions, for -
the welfare of others selflessly, to be superior.

Appendix—In a striver if there is eagerness for salvation, |
there is generosity in his nature and there is compassion in

| his heart viz., he gets happy (pleased) with the happiness of

others and becomes sad (compassionate) with the sufferings of
others—a striver having possessed these three traits becomes
eligible for Karmayoga. Being fit for Karmayoga, Karmayoga
is easily practised. -

In Karmayoga there is one division of ‘Karma’ (duty) and
one division is of ‘Yoga’. Proper utilization of one’s things,

| power, ability; and rendering service to people—this is duty. By
discharging one’s duty there is disunion (disconnection) from the
assumed union with the world—this is yoga. Duty has its relation
with the world and yoga has its relation with God.

Link:—In response to Arjuna's question, why the Lord was
urging him to-take such a dreadful action as, warfare, He replied,
""No one can ever remain even, for a moment without performing
action."" ""Then He. explained that he who, restraining the organs
of action, thinks of the sense-objects, is a hypocrite, while. he
who engages himself in action without expecting any reward, is
superior. Now in the next verse, He orders Arjuna to perform
his allotted duty. |

Fad Ge aa at He Pret Wawa: 1

niyatarh kuru karma tvarh karma jyayo hyakarmanah .

Sarirayatrapi ca te na _ prasiddhyedakarmanah

Do perform thy prescribed duty, for action is superior to
inaction. Besides even the maintenance of the body would not be
possible for thee, by inaction. 8
"
316,"Verse 8] “SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 273
Comment:— OO | | :
'‘Niyatarn kuru karma tvam'— A man is permitted to
perform two types of actions—those as laid down in the
scriptures such as, fasts and worship etc., and the allotted duty
according to one's caste, order of life, nature and circumstance,
such as eating food, doing business, construction of a house
and guiding a person who has lost his way and so on. A |
man cannot perform all actions as laid down in the scriptures,
thoroughly. But he can very easily abandon the forbidden
actions; non-performance of prescribed actions is not very
harmful. Abandonment of forbidden actions, such as falsehood,
theft and violence etc., is very beneficial. When he abandons
forbidden actions, actions sanctioned by the scriptures, are
automatically performed by him. |

In the Discipline of Action, action according to one's caste
and sanctioned by the scriptures, is one's allotted duty, whether
it is terrible or mild. Here Lord Krsna explains to Arjuna, that
as a Ksatriya (member of the warrior class) it is his duty to
fight (Gita 18/43). Though the action involves violence and
bloodshed, yet it.is his allotted duty. In the second chapter
also, the Lord told him that having regard for his own duty he
should not falter (Gita (2/31). In fact 'svadharma’ (One's own
duty) and 'niyatakarma’ (allotted duty), both are one and the
same. For Duryodhana being a member of the warrior class, it
was his duty to fight, yet it was not his allotted duty, as being
unjust he wanted to usurp the Pandava's kingdom. For him, it
was not a nghteous and prescribed, duty.

‘Karma jyayo hyakarmanah'—The Lord, in this verse is,
answering the question put in the first verse, by using the
same term 'jyayah' (superior). There, Arjuna put the question
why He was urging him to perform the terrible action of
waging the war, when according to Him knowlédge was superior
to action. In response to his question the Lord declared, a
"
317,"274 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
person following the path of action, to be superior to person,
following the path of inaction. Thus, Arjuna wants to escape
the battle, while the Lord exhorts him to fight, as it is his
allotted duty. Therefore, the Lord in the eighteenth chapter
declares, ""One should not abandon the duty suited to one's
nature, even though it may be easy"" (18/48), because by
abandoning it, one is exposed to sin and one continues to
be attached to it. Therefore, performance of allotted duty, is
superior to renunciation of actions. Performance of actions
without attachment, is far superior to those performed with
attachment, because by doing so, affinity for actions is totally
renounced. Therefore, the Lord in the first half of this verse,
orders Arjuna to perform his allotted duty without attachment,
while in the second half He declares that maintenance of. the
body would not be possible by inaction either.

In the Discipline of Action the Lord's main principle is
""Action is superior to inaction."" The same fact has been pointed
out by the Lord, when he declares, ""Let not thy attachment be to
inaction” (Gita 2/47). The reason is, that he who shirks his duty
wastes his time in heedlessness, laziness and sleep or performs
forbidden actions, which mislead him to a downfall.

It is better to be detached from actions by performing
them, rather than through their non-performance. A person is in
bondage, due to desire, attachment, partiality etc., whether he
performs actions or not. In the path of action, if a striver has the
aim to renounce desire, it can be renounced very easily, through
the performance of action for the good of others.

'Sarirayatrapi ca te na prasiddhyedakarmanah’— Arjuna had a
misconception in his mind, that his affinity for actions would be
automatically renounced, if he did not perform action. Therefore,
Lord Krsna persuades him to perform actions by several pleas,
one of thése was, that even the maintenance of body would not
be possible, by inaction. |
"
318,"Verse 8] ‘SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 275

As in the Discipline of Knowledge, affinity for the world
is renounced by discrimination, in the Discipline of Action,
affinity is renounced by performing one's duty sincerely and
thoroughly. Therefore, the Discipline of Action, should in no
way be regarded as inferior to the Discipline of Knowledge. |
A Karmayogi, regarding the body as belonging to the world,
uses it in rendering service to the world i.e., he has no sense of
‘mineness', with it. He identifies the physical, subtle and causal
bodies respectively, with the gross, subtle and causal world, while
a Jiianayogi identifies himself with Brahma, the Absolute. Thus
a Karmayogi, identifies the insentient elements while a Jianayogi,
identifies the sentient ones. | |

Generally strivers such as Arjuna, commit an error, that they
insist on non-performance of actions. Secondly, while practising
spiritual discipline they want favourable circumstances, so that
they may attain their aim quickly. But such a desire, is a stumbling
block to their spiritual progress.

A striver who wants to attain bliss easily and quickly, is
a pleasure-seeker rather than a striver, because by doing so he
has an eye, not on the spiritual discipline but on its fruit. The
result is, that he gets tired of spiritual discipline and thus attains
his aim late. A striver, who has a single-minded determination
to attain bliss, is bent upon practising the spiritual discipline,
whole-heartedly without thinking of the difficulties, duration,
pleasure and pain. Not to talk of a striver, even a greedy
merchant bears all hardships, without caring for hunger and
thirst etc., as long as customers continue to come and there
is a good sale. Similarly, a striver practises spiritual discipline
with reverence and devotion, without caring for comfort and
even the bare necessities of life. He has a keen desire to attain
his object. He bemoans if he finds himself unable to overcome
any obstacle in the path of spiritual discipline, while a striver,
"
319,"276 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
who derives pleasure out of the spiritual discipline, gets angry
when he finds an obstacle, in his way. The curiosity or desire _
' Of a striver enhances every moment, while the latter thinks of
- relaxing, having attained the aim quickly. The former thinks that
| he has nothing to do, except practising the spiritual discipline
under all circumstances. So he applies his full power and attains
bliss. But the latter, when he does not succeed quickly, may get
disappointed. Therefore, a striver should attach more importance
to the means, rather than to the end, like Goddess Parvati who
in the Ramacaritamanasa declares, ""I have a firm determination
that I shall marry only Lord Siva, otherwise I shall remain
unmarried even though millions of births may pass. I shall not
disobey the preaching of sage Narada, even if Lord Siva may
ask me to do so, a hundred times"" (1/81/5). Mother Parvati is
not time-conscious, in her penance. |

In this verse, Lord Krsna through Arjuna urges all strivers
to perform their allotted duties very promptly, by renouncing the
desire for favourable circumstances and pleasures, which are the
main stumbling blocks to spiritual progress.

Appendix—A Karmayogi, who performs actions in a
disinterested way, is not only superior to those who do not
perform action or to those who do actions in an interested
manner but is also superior to a ‘Jnanayogr —‘“Tayostu karma
sannyasatkarmayogo visisyate’ (Gita 5/2). Therefore the Lord
here is laying special emphasis on the performance of actions
in a disinterested way.

POLES AD

Link:—In the preceding verse, Lord Krsna declared that
without performing action we cannot keep body and soul together.
It proves that performance of action is essential. But actions lead
to attachment and bondage. So how can a man be free from this
bondage? The Lord, answers the question in the next verse.
"

The mankind is bound by actions other than those done for —

the sake of sacrifice. Therefore, O son of Kunti (Arjuna), perform
action for that (yajiia) sake, and without attachment. 9 |
Comment:—

. ""Yajiarthatkarmano'nyatra'—According to the Gita, every oe
duty is 'Yajiia' (sacrifice). The term ""Yajiia’ includes sacrifice,
charity, penance, oblation, pilgrimage, fast, study ofthe Vedas
and all physical, mundane and spiritual actions. Professions such
as business, service and teaching etc., sanctioned by the scriptures,
are also included in ""Yajna’. Other actions, which are performed
in order to comfort others and for the welfare of others, are also
included in the term ""Yajfia’. Attachment perishes very quickly
by performing actions for the sake of sacrifice and all actions
of a Karmayogi are dissolved (Gita 4/23) 1.e., they instead of |
leading the person to bondage, reduce the stock of his past
actions also to nothing. :

In fact; a man's inclination is judged by his aim, rather than |
by his actions. As a businessman's aim while having a transaction
is to earn money, and he thinks of money, as soon as he shut
his shop, similarly, a striver who performs action for the sake
of sacrifice, has the aim of God-realization and as soon as the
action is over, he is inclined towards God.
The people of different Varnas (castes) have their allotted
duties and actions. A Brahmana (a member of the priest class)
can depend on charity which is a source of his living, while it -
is not allowed for a Ksatriya (a member of the warrior class).
Similarly, performance of actions without having any desire for
fruit, is a man's own duty while performance of actions expecting
"
321,"278 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA — [Chapter 3
_ their fruit is not his own duty. Similarly, forbidden actions are also
not included in one's own duty, and so is the case, with actions
which are performed in order to gain pleasure, honour, praise
and comfort etc.* Therefore, a striver should take precaution lest
the action should be performed with a selfish motive. In fact a
striver is he, who is ever on the alert in this regard.
| If a person receives a visitor with open arms, in order to
create a good impression of his gentleness upon him, it means that
the action has been performed, with a selfish motive. Therefore,
| such an action cannot be called a sacrifice. Similarly, if a person
puts a question to an orator in a meeting or in a discourse in
order to impress the orator and the audience, his action is not
performed for the sake of sacrifice (Yajfia). It means that a striver
should perform action by renouncing his selfish motive and desire.

A striver should not take. any action for pleasure and
prosperity, or even for the maintenance of the body. If actions
are performed for the maintenance of body, it means that there
is a desire to live. Actions should be performed for the sake

_ Of sacrifice alone. Any action taken for personal welfare, leads
: to bondage. Indeed, the supreme striver is he who performs
actions for the welfare of others, even without having a desire
to attain salvation. The welfare of others also involves one's own
welfare. Therefore, all the mundane and spiritual actions should

be performed, for the welfare of others.

Action which is performed for one's own self, leads to
bondage. Therefore, even actions such as remembrance, reflection,
meditation and even a trance should be practised for the welfare.
of the world. Thus whatever a striver does with his physical,
subtle and causal bodies, does only for others, not for himself.
By doing so, his affinity for the world is renounced and he is

'  * When a-man performs actions for himself, it means that he has a desire
for the fruit of actions and where there is desire for the fruit of actions, there is
the possibility of the performance of forbidden actions.

united with God. This is known as Karmayoga. -
'Loko'yarh karmabandhanah'— Only human beings are entitled
to take action in the form of performing a duty (sacrifice), as ,
has been described by the Lord relating to the topic, of the
wheel of creation (3/14—16). He who performs actions with
an interested motive is bound, while he, who performs actions, |
for the welfare of others, performs his duty and attains liberation
from bondage. It is not action but attachment and selfishness, ,
which bind him. -
""Tadartham karma kaunteya muktasangah samacara'—Here |
the term '‘muktasangah' (freedom from attachment) denotes, that
actions should be performed without entertaining the feeling of ,
‘mine’, and attachment to actions, things, body, mind and intellect |
etc. If the feeling of 'mine' and attachment are renounced, actions
are automatically performed for the welfare of others, and if a
striver has no other actions to perform, he automatically gets
established in the self. Consequently, only actions which are
prescribed by the scriptures, are performed by him.
The renunciation of duty out of indolence and carelessness,
is declared to be ""Tamas’ (Gita 18/7) which results in delusion
i.e., such a person is born in the wombs of the deluded. He who
abandons a duty, because it is painful, such relinquishment is
Rajas (Gita 18/8) the fruit is pain (Gita 14/16). Therefore, here
Lord Krsna does not exhort Arjuna to renounce actions but He
orders him to perform actions efficiently and enthusiastically
renouncing selfishness, mineness, attachment, desire for fruit and :
partiality etc., according to the ordinance of the scriptures. Such ,
relinquishment is regarded 'Sattvika' (Gita 18/9). The Lord Himself |
further declares that there is nothing in the three worlds that
must be done by Him, yet He is engaged in action (3/22-23).
A person becomes slack in performing actions because of
two factors—(1) It is in the nature of human beings that they
perform action with a view to reaping the fruit. But when,
"
323,"280 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
according to the Discipline of Action, he realizes that actions
are to be. performed without the desire for fruit, he thinks why
he should perform actions at. all. (2) If having started action, he
realizes that it will bear adverse fruit, he feels that he should
not perform it) = st | oo
A Karmayogi has neither any desire nor expectation of the

perishable fruit of action, he performs actions, only in order to —
do good to the world. So there cannot be any slackness in the
performance of duty. : -

| Generally, a person does an act promptly and efficiently,
only if it serves his selfish motive, but such an action binds
him. In order to be free from the bondage, he should perform
actions prescribed by the scriptures, disinterestedly.

: In the Discipline of Action, all actions are performed for
others. Who are others? Not only other beings and things, but the
so-called our own bodies—gross, subtle, (senses, mind, intellect
and life-breath) and causal (including 'ego') are also, included in
the term 'others’*. The reason is, that the self (soul) is a fragment
of sentient God, while these bodies and things are the fragments
of insentient 'prakrti' (matter). All actions are performed through
the evolutes of nature such as body etc., and for the body and
the world which are also evolutes of nature, while the sentient
neither undergoes actions, nor are actions performed for the |
sentient. So actions can never be performed for the self. But
. * Like the world the body, senses, mind and intellect are also different from
us. Therefore, a Karmayogi without assuming them as his own, serves them.

| ' He does not let the body become sleepy, indolent, heedless, idle and pleasure-
seeking. Thus he renders service to the body. He renders service to the senses
by not allowing them to be engaged in worldly pleasures. He renders service
to the mind by not allowing it to think of doing harm to others or thinking of _
sense-objects or futile things. He serves the intellect by not allowing it to think

_ of the duties of others. He serves all of them by having neither the feeling of
mineness nor attachment. |
"
324,"Verse 9]: . SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 281
when the self assumes worldly insentient things, such .as a body
etc., as ‘I’, 'Mine' and ‘for me’, he performs actions for himself.
By performing actions for others, attachment and the feeling of
‘mine’ perish easily. | | ,

Everybody can realize that the states of the body (childhood,
youth etc.,) undergo change; but he remains the same.’ This
unchanging self (soul) has its identity with God, while the
changing body, senses, mind and intellect etc., have their identity,

with the world. Whatever action is performed by us, is performed
with body and senses etc., not by the self. This shows that we
have nothing to do for ourselves, we have to do only for the |
world. When we perform actions for ourselves, we are bound by
those actions—""The man is bound by actions, other than those
performed for the sake of sacrifice (Yajfia).""

The imperishable and unchanging self, has no affinity for
the perishable and changing body, senses, mind and intellect etc.
Therefore, there is nothing one's own and for one's own self.
We can do nothing without the help of the body etc., therefore
we have to do nothing for the self. The self can never lack
anything. Without want there can arise no desire. Therefore, It
needs nothing for Itself. In this way, when a man's affinity for
actions and things is severed, if he is inclined towards knowledge,
he realizes the self. On the other hand, if he is inclined towards
devotion, he attains to the state of exclusive devotion.

Appendix—-A man is not bound by performing actions but
he is bound by ‘anyatra karma’ viz., actions which are done
with a selfish motive (for himself) (Gita 3/13). Therefore the
expression ‘yajnarthatkarmano’ nyatra loko’ yarn karmabandhanah’
means—nothing is to be done for one’s own self. ,

A man can be free from the bondage of actions only when
he renders service to the world with the body, things, ability
and strength (power) which he has received from the world and
covets no fruit. The reason is that the world can’t provide us
"
325,"282 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA - [Chapter3
the thing which we aim at. We want bliss, want immortality,
want carefreedom, want fearlessness, want independence (self-

| dependence). But all this will not be available to us from. the
world but it will be available by snapping off our ties with the
world. In order to get dissociated with the world, it is necessary
that whatever we have received from the world, we surrender it
to the world in its selfless service.

Link:—The Lord in the preceding verse declared, ""The man
is bound by actions, other than those performed for the sake of
sacrifice."" Therefore, in order to be free from bondage, actions
instead of being renounced, should be performed, only in the
spirit of performing a duty (yajna). The Lord confirms the same

| fact, by giving other reasons in the next three verses.

Comment:— |

'Sahayajfiiah prajah srstva purovaca prajapatih'—One, who
creates beings or things etc., it becomes his duty to preserve
"
326,"Verse 10-11] - SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 283
them. Brahma is the creator and Lord of creation and so he
always thinks of the preservation and salvation of creation. Thus,
he is known as 'Prajapati’ (The Lord of creation).

At the beginning of creation Brahma, the creator, created man
by providing him with power for performing actions and also
bestowed upon him discrimination.* The right use of desirable |
and undesirable circumstances, leads to salvation. Therefore, the
creator bestowed upon mankind discrimination, tn order to enable
them to make the right use of the favourable and unfavourable
circumstances.

Beasts, birds and trees etc., even without having the power
of discrimination, naturally do good to others; but by God's
grace, special power of discrimination has been bestowed upon
mankind. So if a man does not perform forbidden actions, by
attaching importance to his discrimination, naturally actions for
the welfare of others are performed by him.

Though the term 'praja’ (creation) stands for gods, sages,
manes, mankind and other beings (beasts, birds and trees etc.,) yet
mankind is particularly, responsible to rear all beings. Therefore,
here the term 'prajah' stands for mankind.

The Discipline of Action (Karmayoga) has been functioning
from time immemorial. In the third verse of the fourth chapter,
also the Lord by the term ‘puratanah' declares that the same
ancient Yoga has been taught to Arjuna by Him, which was
lost to the world by a long lapse of time. The same fact has
been pointed out here in this verse, in a different way by the
term ‘pura’ (at the beginning) by declaring, ""Not only I, but also |
Brahmi, at the beginning of creation, having created men ordered
them to follow the Discipline of Action.” It means that, this
Discipline of Action has been going on from time immemorial. :
It is nothing new. , |

_ * Brahma, the creator creates mankind under the instruction of God and with
His power. So in fact God is the real creator of creation (Gita 4/13;17/23).
"
327,": 284 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
In the fourth chapter (from the twenty-fourth to the thirtieth
verses), all the sacrifices for God-realization through wealth,

_ austerities, Yoga (spiritual exercise), vital force etc., have been
described. Generally the term ‘yajiia’ is taken as oblation, or sacrifice.
But in the Gita, the term stands for all the prescribed actions as
laid down in the scriptures. All the duties performed according to
one’s caste, order of life, religion, nature, time and circumstances
etc., are included in the term ‘yajna’. Actions performed for the
welfare of others, are also included in yajiia (sacrifice). It
is a man's responsibility, to perform such a sacrifice (duty).

‘Anena prasavisyadhvamesa vo'stvistakamadhuk'— Brahma,
the creator says to mankind, ""By the performance of duty shall

you propagate and by doing so'you shall get all the requisites
necessary for performing your duty.""

Arjuna was not willing to. perform his duty. Therefore,
Lord Krsna says to him that he should learn the lesson of
performing his duty, from the creator's words. By performing
his duty for the welfare of others, he would progress here, as
well as hereafter.

Performance of actions in a disinterested way, leads to
salvation, while performance with a selfish motive, leads to
bondage. Here, is explained the topic of performance of duty,

| without having any desire for fruit. Therefore, the term ‘istakama'
does not stand for the desired material, it stands for the required
material for sacrifice (duty).* -

* Inthe preceding verse Lord Krsna declared, ""The world is bound by actions
other than those performed for the sake of sacrifice 1.e., by actions performed with

the desire for fruit."" Further in the thirteenth verse He declares, ""Those sinful ones
who cook food for their own sake i.e., perform actions for fruit, verily eat sin.""
Thus in the preceding as well as the next verse there is mention of renunciation
. of the desire for fruit. So in the middle verses (tenth, eleventh and twelfth) also
it should be interpreted ‘as the renunciation of the desire for fruit. If the meaning
of the term ‘Istakama' is taken as the desire for fruit, it does not fit this context,
as such actions lead to bondage. So the term stands for the required material for
sacrifice (performance of duty). —
"
328,"Verse 10-11] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 285

A Karmayog! (the follower of the Discipline of Action), is
ever ready to render service or do good to others. Therefore,
according to the ordinance of Brahma, the creator, such a
Karmayogi does not Jack the required capacity and material for
rendering service to others, and for the maintenance of his body.
All this required material is easily available to him. According
to the ordinance of Brahma everybody has been offered this
material, in order to enable him to perform his duty.

In fact, this human body has not been bestowed upon human
beings to enjoy pleasures (Manasa 7/44/1). Therefore, there is
no mention in anyone of the scriptures, that man should enjoy
worldly pleasures. Society also does not permit a person to enjoy
pleasures freely. On the other hand the scriptures, as well as,
society urge a man to bring comfort to others and to do good
to them. It is mentioned in the scriptures, that a father should
foster his son, but it is not mentioned that he is authorized to
expect service from his son. Similar is the case with others, such
as a son and a wife etc.

A Karmayogi always wants to give but not to receive,
because the desire for fruit, besides being a stumbling block
to salvation, is an obstacle to receiving worldly things. This is
everybody's experience, that no one wants to offer anything to a
person who hankers after it. Therefore, Brahma says, that a man
can attain the supreme good (salvation) by performing his duty
in a disinterested manner, without having any desire for reward.

In the expression ‘devanbhavayatanena’ the term ‘deva’
denotes all beings, such as men, gods, sages. and manes etc.,
because the aim of the striver, following the path of action, is |
to nurture every being: So Brahma, the creator orders men to
offer sacrifice, in the form of the performance of duty, in order
to foster and nurture other people for their advancement. Each
man devoted to his own duty, attains perfection viz., salvation
(Gita 18/45). Men are free in the performance of their duty; so
"
329,"286 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
they should make proper use of this freedom.

| 'Te deva bhavayantu vah'— Trees and plants etc., naturally
bear flowers and fruits, but their growth is luxuriant if these are
tended properly. Similarly, a man should perform his duty by
nurturing and fostering the gods by offering worship and service
to them. By doing so, he is sustained by the gods with timely
rain etc. But when he does not perform his duty properly, the
gods do not properly protect and so he has to face calamities,
such as a deluge and drought etc.

‘Parasparam bhavayantah'—This expression should not be
interpreted to mean that we should serve others only, if they

| serve us. It should mean, that we should perform our duty by
serving others, without bothering about of what others do. He,
who cares for the duties of other people, deviates from his own
duty, and has a downfall. Moreover, it is beyond our power
to force anyone, to perform his duty. We have to perform our
duty of fostering others and doing good to them, to the best
of our resources, such as intellect, power, time and material
etc. In that way, our affinity for the insentient (matter), will be
totally renounced.

We have to serve all our relatives, such as parents, wife,
sons, brothers, brother's wives etc., in a disinterested way by
regarding service as our obligatory duty to them according to
the scriptural injunctions. We are born, to repay our debt by
serving, because we are indebted to them. It is an error on
our part, if we expect any reward from them or lay claim to
them. We have to serve all beings, but the first preference
should be given to those kith and kin, who have a claim on
our service.

It is an accepted fact that the body, senses, mind, intellect
and possessions are neither ours nor for us. If we sincerely
perform our respective duties, we will add immensely, to the
welfare of the world.
"
330,"Verse 10-11] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 287
In the Discipline of Action a striver by performing his duty,
safeguards the rights of others. It is the duty of a son to serve
his parents, and the parents have a right to such service.What is
the right of others, is our duty. Therefore, every person should
perform his duty, in order to safeguard the rights of others,
without paying heed to whether they perform their duty or not.
A man deviates from his duty by thinking of the duty of others
and then has a downfall. Nowadays, in families and society at
large, disquietude, conflict, friction and disorder etc., are rampant.
The root cause is, that people demand their rights but they do not
| perform their duty. Therefore, Brahma, the creator preaches to
the gods and men, that it is their duty to do good to each other.
‘Sreyah paramavapsyatha'—Generally people hold that the
statement, that the gods and men by fostering each other, shall
attain the supreme good, is an exaggeration. But in fact, it is
not so. If anyone is doubtful about it, he himself can translate
this principle into practice and see the same result. When the
trust-money is returned to the owner by a person, he has not the
least affinity for that money, similarly when we utilize worldly
things in rendering service to the world, our affinity for the
world and worldly things, is renounced. As soon as, this affinity
is renounced, supreme good is attained. Therefore, it is an error
to take Brahma's word, as an exaggeration.

So long as, a person performs actions for himself, he is bound
by them, and his actions do not come to an end. But when he
does nothing for himself, nothing remains to be done by him
and he does not commit sin, because desire is the root of sins
(Gita 3/37). Therefore, a striver in order to attain supreme good
(salvation), should perform his duty by renouncing attachment and
the desire for fruit, according to the ordinance of the scriptures.
By doing so, attainment of salvation is axiomatic.

Renunciation of one's desire, leads to the welfare of the entire
"
331,"288 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 3
world. He, who enjoys pleasures, being attached to them in order
to satisfy his desire, performs an act of violence (downfall), for
himself as well as for those who lack those materials because
they are sad due to the shortage of those materials. Thus a
pleasure-seeking person cannot escape sins. On the other hand,
one gets peace from those people who follow the spiritual path, as
everyone can lay equal claim to spiritual assets. Thus according
to Brahma, the creator, if a man performs his duty renouncing
desire and attachment, he can attain the supreme good viz.,
salvation, without any doubt.

Here, attainment of the supreme good has been specially
mentioned for human beings, rather than gods. The aim of the
gods is not to attain salvation. But they offer rewards to men,
according to their actions, provide required matter to them for
performing actions and enjoy the reward for their good actions
performed in the past. They do not provide the required matter
disinterestedly. But, when even the vilest sinner can attain salvation;
the gods can also attain salvation if they have a desire to do so.
However generally, their aim is to enjoy the heavenly pleasures,
so they have no desire to attain salvation.

Appendix—-Man alone is qualified for performing new
actions, while eighty-four lac forms of lives, life of gods and
life of beings residing in hells, are the lives to reap the fruit of
their past actions. Men with interested motives go to heaven in
order to enjoy heavenly pleasures. Therefore the gods follow
their responsibility and discharge their duty not disinterestedly.
Therefore eligibility for salvation is only for men.

Salvation is innate while bondage is caused one. Human life
is only to attain salvation. Therefore the person who discharges
his duty, naturally attains salvation—‘paraspararn bhavayantah
Sreyah paramavapsyatha.’ For salvation no new work needs to
be done, but whatever work a man does, if he does it for the
welfare of others, by renouncing selfishness, egoism and the
"
332,"Verse 10-11] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 289
desire for fruit, it will lead him to salvation. Without disinterested
motive, if a man performs his duty, he goes to higher regions
such as heaven etc. The heaven which is attained by performing
grand religious sacrifice, can be attained by a Ksatriya just by
discharging his duty of fighting in a war.

As Brahmaji has told the gods and men to do good to each
other in selfless spirit through their duties, similarly it should
be interpreted that the people of the four Varnas (castes) should
do good to each other. If the people of the four Varnas (social
orders) discharge their duty for the welfare of each other, it will
lead them to salvation.

The entire universe has been created in the manner that there
is nothing (object or action) for one’s ownself but everything
is only for others—‘idarhn brahmane na mama’. For example a
chaste wife is only for her husband, not for herself. A woman’s
organs appeal to a man, not to a woman. Similarly a man’s
organs appeal to a woman, not to a man. A mother’s milk is
only for the child, not for her own self and the child’s activities
are to please the mother, rather than to itself. Parents are for
the good of their offspring and the offspring are for the good
of their parents. The audience is meant for the speaker and the
speaker is meant for the audience. It means that one should
not derive pleasure (comfort) himself but should provide it to
others. The universe has not been created to enjoy pleasures but
to attain salvation.

_ The gods also by renouncing their selfishness, can do good to
others. Therefore among gods also there have been sages such as
Narada etc. Though the Lord’s ordinance does not deprive any-
one of God-realization (salvation) but a man is predominantly
and naturally eligible (qualified) for it.

Here a question may arise that we do good to others but
others instead of doing good to us, do evil to us, then how will
‘parasparam bhavayantah’ be applicable? The answer is that if
"
333,"290 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
we do good to others, others will not. be able to do evil to us.
They will have no power to do evil to us. Even if they do evil
to us, they will repent for it afterwards and will lament for it.
If they do evil to us; there will be many others to do good to
us and to sympathize with us. In fact there is no ordinance
anywhere to do evil to anyone. A man because of aversion does
evil to others. ‘Paraspararn bhavayantah’ (service to each other
selflessly through one’s duty)—this applies to mankind. Without
following it people are suffering pain.

istanbhoganhi vo deva dasyante yajnabhavitah

-tairdattanapradayaibhyo yo bhunkte stena eva sah

Fostered by the sacrifice (yajiia), the gods, will bestow upon
you all the requisite necessary for performing your duty. He who
relishes these, without using these in the service of others, is verily
a thief. 12
Comment:—

'Istanbhoganhi vo deva dasyante yajitabhavitah'—Here the
term 'Istabhoga' does not stand for the desired objects because
in the preceding (eleventh) verse there is mention of attaining
the highest good and this verse in related to that verse. Secondly,
as long as a man has desire, he can't attain the highest good.
So here this term means that the gods will supply him all the
required material for the performance of sacrifice (duty).

Here the expression ""Yajnabhavitah devah' means that the
gods provide the required material to men by regarding it as
their right (responsibility). Men are indebted to them. So they
have to perform sacrifice (duty). -

'Tairdattanapradayaibhyo yo bhunkte'—Brahma used the
"
334,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 291
expression, ""Te devah’ for the gods, because before him, they
were men, not gods. But here the term 'Ebhyah' stands for
neamess. For God, everyone is near Him (Gita 7/26). It proves
that the holy words from Divine lips, begin here.

Here, the term 'Bhunkte' does not stand only for eating, but
for enjoyment of all the objects. (food, clothes, house and money
etc.,) required for the maintenance of a body. |

We owe this body to our parents, and it is they, who have
fostered it. For our knowledge, we are grateful to our preceptors
and sages. The gods have provided us with the material necessary
for the performance of duty. The manes guide us, how to provide
ourselves with comforts. Beasts, birds, trees and creeping vines
etc., sacrifice themselves, in order to provide comfort to others
and do good to them (though they are not aware of it). Thus,
whatever material, strength, ability, rank, authority, wealth and
property we possess, we owe it all, to others. So whatever we
possess, should be devoted to the service of others. 7

The body, senses, mind and intellect etc., are not ours, these
came from the world. So, if we want to enjoy worldly pleasures
by regarding these as our own, they lead us to bondage. But if
we perform our duty by utilizing these in rendering service to
the other people, from whom we have received them, without
expecting any reward, we can get rid of the bondage.

Generally, strivers think that if they render service to the
worldly people, they would be attached to them and would get
entangled in the world. But the Lord's gospel proves, that it is
not service but desire, which leads to bondage. So, it is every
man's duty, like the gods, to serve others and do good to them,
according to his resources. The Lord and gods do not expect
more from him. | :

'‘Stena eva sah'—Here, in the expression ‘Sah stena' (he is a
thief) the purpose of using the singular number is to emphasise
the fact that, he, who without performing his duty, of giving
"
335,"292 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
the required objects (food, water, clothes etc.,) to others, enjoys
them all alone, is a thief.

The person who without repaying the rightful due of others
and enjoys the objects himself, is a thief. Thus a thief is, he who
performs actions with a selfish motive in order to gain honour and
praise etc. Such a person can never gain purity and peace of mind.

This body is neither different nor can be different from the
world, because it is a fragment of the world. Therefore, if a
person assumes the body as his, without accepting the world
as his, this assumption gives birth to pairs of opposites such
as attachment and aversion and also evil propensities such
as pride, individuality and unevenness of mind etc. A striver
following the path of action, gets rid of the pairs of opposites
such as attachment and aversion etc., easily, because whatever
such a striver does, he does for the welfare of the world. He
even practises the spiritual discipline, not for his own salvation,
but for the salvation of the entire world. The reason is, that if
he regards his salvation different from the salvation of others,
it means that he has unevenness of mind, which is a stumbling
block to his spiritual progress. He, who uses the body, senses,
mind and intellect etc., which he has received from the world,
for his selfish motive, 1s dishonest. :

According to Indian culture, a man’s only aim is to attain
salvation. Therefore, Brahma, the creator, at the beginning of
creation, urged men to perform their duty while fostering one
another, without any selfish motive (Gita 3/10).

Members of a family commit an error, that they perform
actions under the influence of desire, mineness, attachment and
selfishness etc. So they have to suffer here, as well as hereafter.
They fall a prey to quarrel, fight, envy and jealousy etc., while
hereafter, they have to reap the adverse fmit of the actions
"
336,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 293
performed by them. When a person serves others in the hope
of reward, he is attached to persons and things. This attachment
leads him to bondage. A selfish man 1s not liked or praised by
anyone. In a family, objects get concealed from a passionate and
pleasure-seeking person. On the other hand, if a person serves
others with all his resources, he attains salvation and is also
praised, honoured, comforted and supplied things, even though he
is unwilling to receive them. A Karmayogi has no desire to win
honour or praise etc., because desires and pleasures bind him.

Desire for pleasure diverts a man from the performance of
duty, and is conducive to his downfall. So a striver, following
the path of action, should always think-of doing good to others

| including the members of his family, without having any pride of
doership. As a mother's milk is meant only for a child, similarly,
whatever material a man possesses, is only for others. Therefore,
a man should not regard his possessions as his own and for
him. The possessions will perish but bondage in the form of
attachment and feeling of mineness will prevail. So the Lord
declares, that he who enjoys the objects, regarding these as his
own, is a thief. .

A man is indebted to the gods, sages, manes, birds beasts,
trees and creeping plants etc., because it is in their nature to
serve him and do good to him. Therefore, five kinds of sacrifice
(for sages, for gods, for creatures, for manes and for men) have
been prescribed in the scriptures. By this fivefold sacrifice (duty),
he can satisfy all of them. Therefore, having shouldered this
responsibility by making use of his freedom, he can attain to
the supreme good. |

The gods etc., do their duty. If men do not perform their
duty, there 1s a commotion not only among the gods but in the
entire universe. Consequently there are natural calamities such
as a deluge, drought, earthquake and famine etc. The Lord in
the Gita (3/23-24) declares, ""If ever, I did not engage Myself
"
337,"294 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
in action, unwearied, men in everyway, would follow My path
and I should be the creator to disordered life as well as, of
destruction of beings"" (Gita 3/23-24). As a whole bullock cart
faces a series of jerks, when even a small portion of a wheel
is damaged, similarly even if a single person deviates from his
duty, he leaves an adverse. effect on the entire universe. On the
contrary, as the recovery of a diseased limb makes the whole
body healthy, similarly the person who performs his duty sincerely
and efficiently, does good to the entire universe.

Brahma, the Creator, ordered both gods and men to perform
their duty. The gods follow a certain code of conduct, but men
ignore it due to their folly. They start laying a claim to the matter,
which has been bestowed upon them for the welfare of others.
Moreover, they have been endowed with freedom, so that by
making proper use. of it, they may be free from the bondage of
actions, in which they have been placed in, since infinity. But,
by misusing that freedom they get attached to actions and their
fruit. Consequently, they get entangled and head for suffering in
numberless future births. Therefore, men should serve all beings
such as God, gods, sages, manes and men etc., with all the
resources and possessions which have been bestowed upon them.

Question:—How will a Karmayogi keep his body and soul
together, if everything is to be utilized in the service of others?

Answer:—In fact this question arises only, when a man
assumes the identity of the self, with the body. A Karmayogi
does not accept his affinity for the body. He regards the body
as the world's and, therefore, serve the world with it. He has
his eyes on the imperishable self, rather than on the perishable
body. Only the person who is mindful of his body, can ask
such a question. so

As long as a person is eager to enjoy worldly pleasures, he
is keen to remain alive and fears: death. A Karmayogi has no
desire for pleasures, all his actions are performed in order to
"
338,"Verse 12} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 295
render service to others, so he does not care, even to live alive.
The question how he will maintain his body, does not arise in
his mind. In fact he who performs his duty, disinterestedly for
the welfare of the world is an asset to the world which provides
for his living. In the domain of God when there is. provision
for the maintenance of the bodies of ordinary creatures, such as
beasts, birds, insects, germs, trees and plants etc., whose lives
are for the good of others, how is it possible that there will be
no provision for the maintenance of the body of the striver who
serves all beings, with all his resources including his body?

The preserver Lord by His grace, has equally bestowed upon
beings the material required for the maintenance of their bodies.
A mother is a living example to prove this fact. The mothers’
breasts, where there is blood in abundance are filled with sweet
and nourishing milk as soon as.a baby is born. Whether it is
through the grace of God or through fate, a man gets the things
necessary for his living. So there is no need to worry about it. In
the domain of God when there is a provision for the maintenance
of the body of even the vilest sinner or a confirmed atheist,
will there not be any provision for maintaining the body of a
Karmayogi ? Therefore, it is futile to raise such a question.

Appendix—The term ‘yajiia bhavitah’ means fostered,
worshipped, enriched by sacrifice. Being in the middle world
the man can foster all living beings who are living in the upper
as well as the lower region. The man has been settled in the
middle region so that he may do good to all. Therefore the man
is qualified (eligible) for attaining salvation.

mankind is not bound by actions, which are performed for the

: yajiiasistasinah santo mucyante  sarvakilbisaih

The righteous who eat the remnants of the sacrifice are released
from all sins; but those sinful ones who cook food for themselves
verily devour sin. 13 : :
Comment:— _ a

'YajiiaSistaSinah santah'—When duties are performed
according to the scriptural injunctions, without any hope of
reward, equanimity (in the form of a remnant of the sacrifice)
is achieved. The main factor in the Discipline of Action is, that
an action is performed only with the material which is received
from the world. Therefore; an action is called ""Yajna' only if
by it selfless service is rendered to the world. After performing
sacrifice (action) the residue. 'Yoga' (Equanimity) is, for oneself.
This 'Yoga' (Equanimity) is the essence which has been called
‘nectar’ in the fourth chapter (4/31). | :

‘Mucyante sarvakilbisaih'—Here the term ‘kilbisaih' means
sins viz., bondage. The Lord has used the adjective, ‘sarva' (all),
which means that having realized equanimity, a man is released
from all bondage. All his actions performed in the past, (as
stored and ripe ones) as well as those performed ones at present,
melt away i.e., are reduced to nothing (Gita 4/23).* When his
actions have been reduced to nothing, he attains to the eternal
Absolute (Gita 4/31).

* When he has no desire, his stored actions of the past disappear. So long
as the body is alive, desirable and undesirable circumstances appear according
to the fortune, but he remains unaffected by them. Thus actions in the form of
fortune also disappear. As far as the actions of the present are concerned, they
are turned into inaction i.e., they don't bear any fruit because they are performed
without any desire for fruit. |
"
340,"Verse 13] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 297

In the ninth verse of this chapter, the Lord declared, “mankind
is bound by actions, other than those, performed for the sake of
sacrifice."" While in the twenty-third verse of the fourth chapter
He declared, ""All the actions of the man who works for the sake
of sacrifice, are dissolved."" The same fact has been pointed out
here, in this verse. It means, that people who realize equanimity,
the remnant of sacrifice, are liberated from all bondage. Not
only the sinful actions, but also the virtuous actions which are
performed, with the hope of fruit, are conducive to bondage. He
who has attained equanimity as remnant of sacrifice, casts away
both good (virtues) and evil (sins) (Gita 2/50).

Now think over the root of bondage. The desire, that
this should happen and that should not happen, is the root of
bondage. Desire is the cause. of all sins (Gita 3/37). So it must
be renounced. |

In fact, desire has no independent existence of its own. It is
born of a feeling of want in the self, while in the self (soul) no
paucity, is ever possible. So the self has no desire. But a man's
self by identifying itself with the unreal body etc., feels the missing
objects for the body, as shortage in him, and thus has a desire for
the unreal. He should realize that he (self) ever remains the same,
while the worldly objects and actions appear and disappear, these
are born and perish. So, how can the perishable fulfil the desire
of the imperishable? Therefore, it is a folly to hanker after those
sense-objects. They cannot make up the deficiency. If a serious
and proper thought, is given to this point, desires can be wiped
out easily.

When a striver renders service with his body and things
etc., without regarding these as his and for him, his affinity with
the body and things etc., is renounced and he realizes the real
self. Then, he feels no want. Such a man is liberated from the
bondage of the world, while he is alive.

""Ye pacantyatmakaranat'—All kind of desire, selfishness,
"
341,"298 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
attachment etc., are included in the expression ‘atmak4ranat'
(for their own sake). The more selfish a man is, the greater a
sinner he is. : oO

Here the term '‘pacanti' denotes, all the mundane actions
such as eating, drinking, walking, sitting and so on. Whatever
action a selfish man performs, either for himself or for others,
performs only for himself. On the other hand, a striver who,
having renounced selfish motives while performing his duty, works
for others only, even when he appears to work for himself. He,
who uses the objects which he has received from the world for
his own enjoyment, actually cooks food for his own sake. It is
a great sin to regard the body, a fragment of the world, as one's
own and for one's own self. But he who without, regarding the
body as his own, supplies necessities such as food, water and
clothes etc., to it, and does not allow it to be lazy, heedless and
pleasure-seeking, renders service to it and becomes free from the
feeling of mineness and attachment to it. |

Man himself, has to reap the fruit of actions performed by
him. But his actions affect the entire world. He who performs
actions for himself, deviates from his duty. That deviation results
in calamities such as famines, epidemics and deaths etc., in a
country. So, it is proper on the part of a man, that he should
do nothing for himself, should regard nothing as his own and
should desire nothing for himself. .

He who expects the perishable fruit of actions, 1s also like
those who cook food, for their own sake. So the Lord in the
first verse of the sixth chapter, declares that a Karmayogi should
perform his allotted duty without depending on the fruit of actions.
When a man totally renounces dependence on the fruit of action,
he does nothing for himself and thus gets estahlished in Yoga.

'Bhuiijate te tvagharh papa'—The Lord condemns the sinful
ones, who perform actions for themselves. Such persons store so
many sins which are not exhausted even after suffering tortures
"
342,"Verse 13] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 299

‘in hells and eighty-four lac forms of lives, but their sinful actions
remain as stored actions (saficita karma). Human life is such a
marvellous field in which, as we sow so shall we reap for many
births to come*. Therefore, a man must resolve not to commit
sins in future i.e., must not perform actions for himself. Such
a resolution. means a great power. The fact is, that all the sins
of a man who resolves to follow the spiritual path, cease to be
committed by him.

Appendix—The body, ability, rank (position), authority,
knowledge and power etc., which a man possesses, have been
obtained and will be lost. Therefore they are not ours and are
not for us, but they are for rendering service to others. Our
Indian culture is summed up in this principle. As all the organs
of the body are for the welfare of the body, so all the people
of the world are for the welfare of the world. A man may be of
any country, guise, Varna (social order), aSrama (stage of life)
etc., may easily attain salvation by rendering service to others
through his actions.

Whatever characteristic we have, is for others, not for us.
If all the people follow this idea, no one will remain bound
but ali will become liberated souls. If you use the things which
you have received from the world is the service of others, what
have you spent of your own? It leads you to salvation free of
cost. Besides this, nothing needs to be done for salvation. We
are responsible to spend only whatever we possess, we have no
responsibility to spend more than that. A man can’t do more than
that. If we spend the things, ability and strength etc., completely
in rendering service, we shall attain complete salvation.

In fact the body is useful only for the world, not for one’s
own self because the body is not for us at all. The body is

needed in order to do some action. If nothing is to be done, then
what is the need of the body? Therefore to do any action for
one’s own self with this body, is a flaw. We can’t do anything
for the self with the thing which we have received, but with
that we can serve the world. The body is a fragment of the
world; therefore whatever will be. done with it, will be only
for the world. The body-senses-mind-intellect can’t go beyond
the world, they can’t be separated from the world. Therefore
performance of actions for one’s own self, is not human nature
but it is demoniac and devilish nature. In fact a man is only a
human being in the real sense, who does actions for the welfare
| of others. He who performs actions for one’s own pleasure, verily
devours sin viz., ever remains sad, while those who work for the
welfare of others, are released from all sins viz., become happy
forever—‘yajiiasistamrtabhujo yanti brahma sanatanam’ (Gita 4/31).

is the son of Prtha (Kunti) who performed her duty even by
suffering troubles throughout her life. So he should also perform |

was not really terrible, it was a sacrifice (duty). He who performs
his duty, follows the wheel of creation, while he who does not
perform his duty, does not follow this cycle.]

‘Iindriyaramah'—Sensual is he, who enjoys the worldly objects _
through his senses, by having desire and being attached to the .
sense-objects. Such a person is inferior even to beasts, because
beasts instead of performing sinful actions, are purified by receiving
the fruit of their sins of the past. But a man committing new
sins, has a downfall and by creating disturbance in the wheel -
of creation, hurts the entire creation. :
'Aghayuh'—The life of such a man 1s sinful, because he who
wants to enjoy sensual pleasures, cannot escape sin. The person -
who hankers after selfishness, pride, pleasures and prosperity,
causes suffering to others and thus he is of a sinful nature. Saint 7
Tulasidasa in the Ramacaritamanasa declares, ""Those who are
malicious, engrossed in adultery, slanderous and hanker after the

of Lord Rama, the wild tribes said, that if they did not steal
anyone's clothes and utensils, it meant that they were rendering
service to Him (Manasa 2/251/2). Similarly, such persons who
do not perform their duty, should not at least disturb the wheel
of creation. By doing so they could render service to creation.
Such a person who does not follow the cycle of creation,

Comment:—

""Yastvatmaratireva syadatmatrptaSca manavah atmanyeva
ca santustastasya'—Here the term ‘tu’ (but) has been used to
differentiate, a person, who has become enlightened having
performed his duty, from the person who does not perform his
duty, as described in the preceding verse.

So long as a person assumes his affinity for the world, he
rejoices in the sensual pleasures, wife, sons and family, remains
"
348,"Verse 17] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 307 ;
satisfied with food and is content in riches. But they cannot
provide him with perfect and lasting rejoicing, satisfaction and

- contentment, because the world is ever-changing, insentient and
perishable while the self is uniform, sentient and imperishable. ~
So how can the self be satisfied and be contented with the world, |
when there is not even the least affinity between the two?

A man cannot take delight in the world constantly. A newly :
married couple take delight in each other but that joy or attraction -
does not continue to exist after the birth of one or two babies.
Sometimes, an old woman is heard saying, about her husband, -
""It is good, if the old man dies."" The satisfaction provided by -
food and riches etc., is momentary and temporary, also.

In fact, the worldly objects cannot provide lasting delight,
satisfaction and contentment to man. If these had provided real _
delight, satisfaction and contentment, man would have never felt
their absence. In the self, delight, satisfaction and contentment
naturally exist because the self is real and the real never ceases -
to be (Gita 2/16). As the real always exists, there is no deficiency
in it and without that no desire is born. So there is no desire _
in the self. But when the self by an error assumes its affinity
with the world, it seeks delight, satisfaction and contentment in
the world, and has a desire for the worldly objects. When one .
desire is satisfied and the second is not born, at that time, he oo
remains free from any desire and that state of freedom provides
him with delight. But, man by error thinks that he has received
delight, satisfaction and contentment by the satisfaction of desire.

Had he got that delight by the satisfaction of desire, that delight

should have continued unabated and there would have been no |
more desire for that object again. In fact, it does not happen

so. When one desire is satisfied, another new desire is born and

the process continues. When one has desire, it means he feels a :
deficiency and when he receives the desired object, he becomes

a slave to it. Thus a man with a desire ever remains sad.
"
349,"308 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3 :

Here, a point needs attention. A striver rightly thinks that
lack of desire is the root of delight, while desire is the root of
sorrows. But the people attached to the world think otherwise.
They think that they get delight in having received objects or ~

_ things and they are, sad without them. If they realize the reality :
like the strivers, they could also get rid of desires.

People, who perform actions with the expectation of fruit,
deserve, to follow the Discipline of Action (Srimadbhagavata
11/20/7). Such people derive joy, satisfaction and contentment /
out of the world. So the Lord, having described such persons who 7
perform actions without the desire, for their fruit declares that
such strivers, unlike the worldly people, are delighted, contented
and satisfied in the self (Gita 2/55).

In fact delight, satisfaction and contentment are not different
from each other, yet they seem to be different, because of a person's ~
affinity for the world. As soon as this affinity is renounced, an
enlightened soul is delighted, satisfied and contented in the self, ;
their difference which seemed to exist, disappears.

The Lord in this verse, has used the terms ‘eva’ (Only) and
'Ca' (And) twice, while further in the eighteenth verse, He has -
used these terms, once. That shows, that a Karmayogi (One who
follows the Discipline of Action) does not suffer a shortage of :
delight, satisfaction and contentment and needs no greater bliss :
than this one (Gita 6/22). Be

'Tasya karyarhn na vidyate'—The aim of the performance
of actions for a man, is to attain salvation or God-realization.

When this aim is achieved by anyone following the Disciplines

of Actions, Knowledge or Devotion, nothing remains to be done,
known and acquired by him and that is the supreme achievement

of a human life.

In the self, there is no shortage. But so long as a man because
of his affinity for the world, feels shortage in him (self) he
performs actions for himself by regarding the body as 'T and
"
350,"Verse 17] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 309 7
‘Mine’. In that case there remains some work which needs to be |
done by him. But when he, instead of performing the actions for
himself, performs them for others, such as body, senses, mind,
intellect, life-breath, parents, wife, sons, family, society, country -
and the world, his affinity for the world 1s renounced. When his :
affinity for the world is completely renounced, nothing remains
to be done by him, because there is no activity then in the self. a
Whatever action is performed, that is performed because of the |
affinity for the world, by worldly things. Therefore, work is to ”
be done by those, who have affinity for the world.
An action is performed, when there is desire to acquire |
something, and desire is born of want. The enlightened souls
have no want, so they have to do nothing.
When through the Discipline of Action, an enlightened soul
is delighted, satisfied and contented in the self, and nothing -
remains to be done, known and acquired by him, he transcends
prescription and prohibition. Though such a God-realized soul,
rises above the ordinance of the scriptures, yet his actions are ;
in accordance with the scriptural injunctions, and these are |
examples for others. .
The expression ""Tasya karyam na vidyate’, does not mean that
no action is performed by that God-realized soul. But it means
that though no work remains to be done by him, actions are |
performed by him, for the welfare of others. As the activities such SO
as lowering and raising of eyelids, breathing and digestion etc.,
go on automatically, similarly, all exemplary activities prescribed
by the scriptures are automatically performed, by the enlightened
soul, (as he has no sense of doership).
Appendix—-A Karmayogi performs all actions with a selfless
motive to serve the world. As the Ganges is worshipped with
Ganges-water; similarly by applying the body, senses, mind,
intellect and ego, which he has received from the world, in
rendering service to the world, the connection with the body
"
351,"310 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 ~
and. the world is snapped off and the Self or Divinity is revealed.
Therefore he takes delight and is gratified and is contented in
the Self alone.

The worldly injunction and prohibition—both are indeed ~
prohibition (negation) because these two can’t last (remain). A ~
Karmayogi having renounced affinity for the world rises above
all prescriptions and prohibitions. “Tasya karyarn na vidyate’ _
(He has no duty to perform).

For him in this world, there is no gain whatsoever, in the

Comment:— | |

'Naiva tasya krtenarthah'—Everyone has a tendency to do ~
some work or the other, for himself. So long as a man has the
tendency to acquire worldly things, some work remains to be |
done by him. He is bound by the desire of acquiring something -
or the other. Performance of duty is inevitable-in order to get ~ = =
rid of that desire. |

Actions are performed in two ways—either in order to
satisfy desire or to get rid of desire. Common men work in order _
to satisfy their desires, while a Karmayogi performs actions, in -
order to get rid of desires. Therefore, an enlightened soul being
free from desire, has not the least affinity for the performance
of duty. Actions are performed by him, automatically without
any selfish motive, for the welfare of the entire creation. _

Such a God-realized soul realizes that all the worldly objects,
"
352,"Verse 18] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 311 oe
body, senses, mind and intellect etc., are not his own, but these |
belong to the world.
So, these should be utilized for the world. This is, because |
no action can be performed without the help of the world. Apart -
from this, matter required for action, is also an offshoot of the oe
world. It is in no way related to one's own self. Therefore, nothing
is ours. The cosmos can never be meant for an individual. Here, an
lies the fault with man, that he tries to utilise the cosmic entity .
for his individual purposes. This generates unrest. If he utilises |
his body, senses, mind, intellect and matter etc., for universal -
use, he can get a state of quietude. This characteristic exists in an ,
accomplished Karmayog!, that all his so-called body, senses, mind, |
intellect and matter etc., are utilised for the service of the entire .
world. Thus, he is totally unconcerned about his bodily activities.
Even then, a great person instinctively performs excellent deeds, -
ideal for the generality of men. Thus, by utilizing these for the |
world, he attains great peace and his actions are exemplary. ;
""Nakrteneha kaScana'—He, who assumes his affinity for the |
body, senses, mind and intellect etc., and remains inclined towards ;
indolence and sloth, does not want to perform actions, because a
he wants to enjoy pleasure which arises from sleep, indolence
and sloth, and which is declared to be of the nature of ignorance oo
(Gita 18/39). But, how can a_ great soul, who transcends even Be
the Sattvika happiness, be inclined towards pleasure, arising Oe
out of ignorance? When he has not even the least affinity
for body etc., how can he be inclined towards indolence and
heedlessness etc.? |
Generally strivers attach importance to actionlessness.
They want to place themselves in trance (Samadhi) and, being
completely unattached with actions, so that no thoughts are left
to act. This is an excellent and useful thing no doubt, but not
"
353,"312 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
as a principle (final truth). Though inaction is superior to action,
yet it is not the goal. a
_ Inclination and abstention, both are within the realm of nature.

Upto the 'Nirvikalpa’ trance, every stage is within the reign of _
prakrti, because deviation is possible even at this stage. Every _
action takes place in prakrti. Even a deviation from trance involves
action and without action such deviation is impossible. Therefore —
like walking, speaking, laughing and hearing etc., sleeping, sitting, _
standing, keeping quiet, fainting and going into a trance, also are
actions. The real essence (conscious self) 1s free from inclination -
and abstention both. The self, is an untainted illuminator of action —
and inaction both. When a person identifies the self with the
body, actions are divided into two classes—performance and
non-performance. But in fact, both of these belong to the same

: class. Till attachment to the body persists, non-performance of ~
an action, is also an action. As 'go' is a verb so ‘stand’ is also a
verb and both involve activity, though in the former the activity _
is clearly seen, while in the latter it is not apparent.

The question of performance or non-performance of actions,
arises only when a man has affinity with a body. Unless such
affinity is there, no action is possible.

An enlightened soul who renounces his total affinity for nature,
and its evolutes, (the insentient matter), realizes the self, which _ |
transcends both activity and non-activity. Therefore, a striver
should renounce his affinity for matter (egoism and attachment to
the body). The self (tattva) ever remains the same, as always.

‘Na casya sarvabhittesu kaScidarthavyapasrayah'—When
a great soul has not the least selfish affinity for a body and _
the world, all his actions are automatically performed for the
welfare of others. As limbs of a body are ever engaged in doing
good for the body, the body (a fragment of the world) of that
enlightened soul, ever remains engaged in doing good to the world.
Moreover, he has not the least pride or desire for fruit or

354,"Verse 18] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 313
selfish motive, like a hand when it washes the face.

In the preceding verse, the Lord declared that there exists
no work that needs to be done by a God-realized soul. In order _
to explain the reason, the Lord mentions three factors—(1) Such a
a soul has no interest in what is done. (2) He has no interest
in what is not done. (3) He does not depend on anything or
creature for any interest of his. |

In fact, the self has no interest in what is done or what is not 0
done and has no affinity with, either any being or thing because ~
no action is performed by the self. All actions are performed, only :
when the self assumes its affinity for nature, and the things born
of nature. Therefore, no action is to be performed for the self.

So long as a man has a desire to do, to acquire and to
live, and he is afraid of death, he has got to perform actions. -
But when he renounces this desire and is not afraid of death,
he has not to perform action, but action (duty) 1s automatically
performed by him. One who is susceptible to deviation from -
duty needs advice.

In the Gita, Lord Krsna explains the marks of a God-realized |
soul according to the Discipline, which they follow as strivers. :
The same description has been given here, in the seventeenth SO
and the eighteenth verses.

The topic of the Discipline of Action, begins from the thirty-
ninth verse of the second chapter, but the gist has been explained
in the forty-seventh verse of the second chapter, when the Lord .
declares it in four stages: —

(1) Thy night is to work only.

(2) Have no desire for its fruit.

(3) Do not be the cause of the fruit of action.

(4) And let thy attachment be not towards inaction. |
"
355,"314 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 ~
, In this verse (3/18) is the description of a God-realized soul,
who has attained perfection through Karmayoga, as described in
the previous verse. Whatever, has been said there, (in 2/47) in the
second and the third point for the striver, the same has been said, -
in the second half of this verse, for the God-realized soul, that ~
he has no affinity for any creature or thing. Similarly, whatever
has been stated in the first and the fourth point for the striver, —
the same has been said, in the first half of this verse for a God- _
realized soul, that he has no interest in what is done or what
is not done. Thus, in the verses seventeenth and eighteenth, the -
description of the marks of a God-realized soul, who has realized
Him, through the Discipline of Action, has been given.

'. According to the Discipline of Action, the eighteenth verse
should. have preceded the seventeenth verse, because when a
God-realized~soul, has. no interest in what is done or what is _
not done, and when he does not depend on any creature for
any interest of his, he gets joy, satisfaction and contentment in .
his own self. But, in the sixteenth verse the Lord declared, ""He
who does not perform his duty, lives in vain."" Therefore, in the _
seventeenth verse by using the expression 'Yah tu' (who but), the
Lord explains that if a God-realized soul, does not perform his |
duty, he does not live in vain, but his life is very useful, as he -
has attained the aim of human life. Therefore, nothing remains _ |
to be done by him. |

_ The state in which nothing remains to be done, can be attained
even by a common man, by performing his duty, efficiently
without expecting any reward, because everyone deserves to
attain Him. The practice of Karmayoga, can be performed in —
all circumstances. The desire for sensual pleasure, is the main
obstacle to the performance of one’s duty. So, if a striver wipes
out this desire for pleasure by serving others, without having

any selfish motive, he can attain supreme peace by getting rid
of all pains, and sorrows of life. As far as the supreme peace
"
356,"Verse 19] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 315
is concerned, everyone is equally deserving, to attain it, while
it is not possible, for everyone to have worldly possessions in
equal share. .
Appendix—In the world ‘performance of action’ and ‘non- .
performance of action’ are related expressions. Therefore ‘I have
to do nothing’—this is also an action. But in Godhood ‘inaction
is natural and automatic. The reason is that the divine entity has
nothing to do with action or inaction. Therefore a God-realized
Karmayogi has neither any relation with a thing, nor with a
person nor with an action—‘yo’ vatisthati nengate’ (Gita 14/23). 7
From his view-point nothing exists except the divinity.

Comment:—
'Tasmadasaktah satatarh karyam karma samacara'—The term
‘Tasmat’ (therefore) has been used to connect the preceding verse
with this verse. In the preceding verse, the Lord declared that
actions are performed by a God-realized soul, for the welfare
of others though there is no need for him to perform these.
Therefore, the Lord uses the term ‘tasmat', to make Arjuna to
realize God, by performing his duty without expecting any
reward. The reason is, that the self has no interest in what is
done or what is not done. Actions are ever performed for others,
"
357,"316 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 ~
not for the self. When a striver performs actions for others, his
attachment to perform actions disappears, and he gets established
in the self. He is attached to them, when he thinks ""I am body"", _
""The body is mine” and regards the perishable objects such as _
body etc., as significant. : /

It is attachment, not action, which leads to one's downfall.
Being attached to the body, senses, mind, intellect and other |
mundane objects etc., a man performs actions, in order to derive -
pleasure out of them. This attachment for the materialistic objects
etc., leads him to the cycle of birth and death. The Lord declares, ~

""Attachment to the modes born of nature, is the cause of the
birth of soul in good and evil wombs"" (Gita 13/21). When a
striver performs actions without attachment, his affinity for the
insentient (matter) is renounced. -

All actions of a striver who performs them, being free from
attachment, are automatically for the welfare of all creatures,

: while the person who is attached to mundane objects and actions ~
etc., cannot do good to others. _

So far, we have used mundane materials such as a body etc., -
for our own pleasure and prosperity. Therefore, we are indebted
to the world. We can repay our debt by performing our duty for
the welfare of the world. When we perform action for ourselves, -
instead of being free from debt, we run into debt, more and more. -
Therefore, we have to take birth in the world again and again,
in order to free ourselves of debt. By performing actions for
the welfare of others, we get out of the old debt and we cease
to run into new debt, as we perform actions in a disinterested
way. Thus, we are liberated from bondage. /

An action cannot be performed constantly, but attachment
remains constant. So the Lord by the expression ""Satatarn asaktah""
urges Arjuna, to be constantly free from attachment. A striver,
should perform his duty, prescribed by the scriptures constantly
without attachment. In fact attachment also does not remain
"
358,"Verse 19] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 317 |

constant. Even when the world itself is not constant, 1t 1s ever-

changing how can its attachment remain constant? In spite of that,

in the assumed ego, attachment seems to be there, constantly. _
‘Karyam' viz., duty is that, which can be done and must be .

done. In other words, duty is action, which must be performed for

the welfare of others, according to the ordinance of the scriptures

and according to one’s capacity, by renouncing one's selfish motive.

In this way, duty is linked to the welfare of others. : -
Everyone has the freedom and capability to perform one's

duty. It can be performed very easily. But it 1s because of -

heedlessness, indolence and desire for fruit, that its performance

seems difficult. A man can perform his duty, independently under

all circumstances. Attachment perishes through the performance

of duty, while it enhances through the non-performance of duty. _

By performing duty for the welfare of others, we get rid of our

present attachment and by not expecting any reward from them

get rid of future attachment. -
The term 'samacara’ means, that the duty must be performed

very carefully, enthusiastically, promptly and duly, so that the -

aim may be attained. If there is the least dereliction of duty, it

creates a great hurdle in the path, of a Karmayogi. A man's duty

according to his caste, order of life, nature and circumstances :

prescribed by the scriptures is 'sahaja karma’ (innate duty). One -

should not give up one's innate duty, even though it may have

flaws (Gita 18/48), because by doing so, one does not incur sin

(Gita 18/47). So, the Lord seems to urge Arjuna, to perform his

innate duty of waging war, because he is a Ksatriya (a member

of the warrior class), even though the act may seem terrible to

him. An innate duty must be performed without attachment, as

it leads to equanimity.
When a being is born as a human being, he is provided
"
359,"318 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 |
with all the matter, such as body, riches, property etc., and he

has to leave behind all the materials here, when he departs. It
proves that he has been granted this material in the same way, -
as a clerk is provided with the material in the office, so that :
he may work with it. But it does not mean, that it is his. As

a clerk is paid for doing the office work, similarly a striver |
who performs actions for the world, his affinity for the world
is renounced and he realizes his identity (unity) with God. This -
unity with God, is his reward.

This world is the field for practising spiritual discipline. 7
Whatever material has been provided to us here, is only for
practising spiritual practices, rather than for pleasure and
prosperity. It is, neither ours nor for us. If and when, we gain
our own objectives viz., the Supreme Bliss (God-realization), _
(Self-realization) nothing remains to be gained after that i.e.,
there remains no desire for anything else (Gita 6/22). But we
may acquire innumerable worldly things, the desire to acquire |
more, is never satisfied, it rather enhances.

When by error, a person accepts a thing as his own and for -
him he is attached to it. The Discipline of Action is an easy
and good method, to wipe out this error. A Karmayogi, who |
without assuming a thing as his own and for him, uses it in order 7
to render service to others, is easily liberated from the worldly -
bondage, as he performs actions for the world, by renouncing
attachment, a feeling of 'mine’ and desire etc., for the same. Thus
the flow of his actions, is towards the world and he is liberated.

On the other hand, a common person who performs actions with
attachment, with feelings of ‘mine’ and desire etc., the flow of
actions is towards him and so he is tied to these.

‘Asakto hyacarankarma'—It is a man, who establishes a link
with the world, and not the world with him. A striver should
perform actions for the welfare of the world without attachment,
having no desire for their fruit. His present affinity for the things
"
360,"Verse 19] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 319
and persons of the world is renounced, by rendering service to
them, and with things and persons of the: future by having no
desire for these. 7 | 7 -
In a fair, volunteers render service to the public, without -
expecting any reward. So they sleep soundly without even
remembering any person of the public. Similarly, a striver who
serves others without expecting any return not ever honour and
praise etc., does not remember them and is thus easily liberated .
from the worldly bondage. ;
In the Discipline of Action, actions are performed for the
welfare of others, without any attachment. Attachment can be
wiped out, only when actions are performed according to the
scriptural injunctions (Manasa 3/16/1). Attachment can never be
wiped out by performing forbidden actions. -
- ‘Paramapnoti purusah'—As in the thirty-fourth verse of the /
thirteenth chapter the Lord has mentioned attainment to the
Supreme by the term ‘param’ (the supreme) for a Sankhyayogi |
(follower of the Discipline of Knowledge), similarly, it has been
mentioned here by the same term for a Karmayogi, (follower -
of the Discipline of Action). It means that a striver according
to his taste, inclination and faith, attains God-realization, by
anyone of the Disciplines of Action, Knowledge or Devotion  —S
(Gita 5/4-5). God is, He Who pervades everywhere, everytime, -
Who is everyone's and is attainable to everyone, undoubtedly
and automatically. ,
Question:—How can the pride of doership which is an
obstacle to God-realization, be wiped out? |
Answer:—-Common people perform actions for themselves,
thinking that they are the doers. But a Karmayogi thinks that
whatever he has acquired from the world, is not his, but it is
of the world. Therefore, with the body, senses, mind, intellect,
money and material etc., which he has acquired from the world, he
renders service to the world. Thus his pride of doership perishes.
"
361,"320 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 3

| A Karmayogt, does not perform actions, in order to enjoy
their fruits. He regards, the body as a fragment of the world.
Therefore, there is nothing special to be proud of, if the body -
renders service to the world, in the same way, as a hand is not :
proud of rendering a great service to the face, by washing it.

A man performs actions in order to achieve a goal. As

soon as the action is over, he ‘gets engrossed, in that goal. As a -
businessman starts business in order'to earn money, but as soon
as his transaction is over, he starts counting the money without _
even thinking of customers etc., who had come to buy articles
from his shop. A worldly man, having a mundane aim, remains
engrossed in the world but he cannot be identified with the
world, in spite of doing so, because the world is kaleidoscopic
and insentient, while the self is uniform and sentient. But the ~
striver who performs actions having God-realization as his aim
gets identified with God, (whether he realizes this fact or not),
because both of these are uniform and sentient. In this state of
identification, no question can arise regarding the pride of doership.

- Actions have a beginning and an end. So a person who ;
performs an action, also ceases to be a doer, as soon as the action
ends. But being under an illusion, he regards himself as a doer, |
even when he does not perform any action. Thus by considering
himself as a doer constantly, his pride of doership, instead of :
perishing, enhances. An orator, considers himself an orator even
when he does not make a speech. He regards himself superior to
the audience and wants the people to honour and serve him and
to fulfil his necessities. But if he regards himself as an orator
only, during the period of a speech and not afterwards, he will
expect no reward from the audience, and thus his doership will
merge in his aim.

As an eater regards himself as an eater, only when he eats

food, a Karmayogi also regards himself as a doer, only when he
performs actions and not at other times. Suppose a Karmayogi, ; a
"
362,"Verse 19] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 321
delivers discourses and he has won high fame; in spite of that,
if an occasion arises to hear a discourse, he can easily listen to
it, without expecting any honour, respect and status, as now he
_ considers himself a listener, not a speaker, without any superiority

complex. He becomes a hearer or a speaker, according to the
need of the moment. Thus his pride of doership does not remain
constant. A thing which changes actually, does not exist. So
how can a relationship with it remain constant? By thinking so,
a striver comes to realize his egolessness.

An actor in a drama plays the role of Hariscandra, but
while playings that role, he does not regard himself as a real
Hariscandra. Similarly, a Karmayogi, while performing all actions
according to the scriptural injunctions, does not regard himself,
as a doer. He, like an actor, serves the world with the worldly -
things, without regarding these as his or for himself. Thus he
has no pride of doership, in the least.

Similarly, he accepts his affinity for his kith and kin, while
serving them, only in order to serve them. He performs his duty to
the best of his capacity and resources, towards his wife, children -
and other members, even though they.are ugly, hard-hearted and
quarrelsome. Moreover, he thinks that his wife or children are |
not only his, but also of others. For example, his wife is her :
children's mother, her father's daughter, her brother's sister and ;
so on. Thus, they have also a claim on her. Similar, is the case’
with other relatives such as father, sons and brothers etc. So a
striver performs his duty efficiently, like an actor without thinking
of the duty of others. By having the pride of doership, a man |
thinks of the duty of others and by thinking so, he deviates from
a duty, while a Karmayogi does not accept his constant affinity
for his caste, order of life, sect and circumstances etc., and so
he performs his duty efficiently. A thing which is not constantly
in existence, is for that matter, not in existence at all. Thus, the
sense of doership of a Karmayog! automatically perishes.
"
363,"322 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3 |
A man has his identity with God, if he has no sense of doership -

unless he ignores. the reality. As a swing while moving, stops still -

for a fraction of a second, at the rope end, in the same way, there

is always the state of actionlessness (equanimity) after a swinging

action ends and the second one begins. Secondly, if we perceive

in the right perspective, we come to know that as the rope of the

swing when it moves, remains straight, a man also remains in a

state of equanimity, even while working. If he wants to realize ~

this fact, he can do so, as soon as an action is over. In case a

striver is ever careful, in this respect, he can realize equanimity

or his identity with God, where there is no sense of doership.

In order to wipe out the pride of doership, a striver should _
distinguish the real which really exists, from the unreal (illusion)
which seems to exist. The world which is changing always is
illusory while the all-pervading Lord is real and He is automatically
attainable to everyone—from Brahma, the creator, to even an
ant, equally. _

The world which seems to exist, 1s every second getting
destroyed. The senses, mind and intellect etc., with which the
world is seen, reflect nothing but illusion. The all-pervading
Lord Who ever exists, is always attainable to us. Therefore, in ~
the Gita it has been declared, ""The unreal has no existence and
the real never ceases to be"" (2/16).

All the worldly objects and actions are nothing but an illusion.
Actionlessness, exists at the beginning and the end, of every action. ;
And this is a rule, that whatever is at the beginning and the end
also remains in the middle. Therefore, actionlessness automatically
exists, even when an action is going on. That actionless essence
viz., the Sentient or God is the illuminator, of both actions and
actionlessness and He, transcends the two.

It is because of our attachment (affinity) to the illusion (objects,
"
364,"Verse 20] - SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 323 /
actions and persons etc.,) that we cannot realize God. As soon as |
attachment is renounced, ever attainable God is realized. Therefore,
when being free from attachment, we apply this illusion (body
and objects etc.,) in the service of the illusory (world), the flow  —s_
of this illusion (body and objects etc.,) is towards the world and |
God the divine essence that is ever attainable, remains.

perfection. Thou should perform selfless action, also for the good
of the world. 20
Comment:— ;
""Karmanaiva hi samsiddhimasthita janakadayah'—The term |
‘adi’ stands. for, ‘beginning’ as well as, ‘like’. Here the former |
meaning does not apply becausé before Janaka, there had been
great souls like Vivasvan, Vaivasvata Manu and king Iksvaku,
who had attained perfection through the performance of action
(Gita 4/1-2). Therefore, here it is used in the latter sense which
means that some great souls like Janaka, before and after him,
leading householder's life attained salvation by action. |
_ This Discipline of Action is very old. By this discipline,
Janaka and several other great souls have attained salvation or
God-realization. Therefore, if anyone at present or in future, wants
to realize God through the path of action, he without regarding
the body and the objects as his own, should apply these in the
"
365,"324 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3 :
service Of the world by considering these as the world's. In fact,

they belong to the world. By doing so one's affinity with the :
world is easily renounced and God is attained. Therefore, the 7
Discipline of Action is an easy, good and independent means .
to realize God.

Here the expression, 'Karmana eva’ stands for the expression
'Asakto hyacarankarma' i.e., performance of action without
attachment. By performing the actions thus, a man is liberated
from their bondage otherwise he is enslaved (Mahi., Santi. 241/7).

It is the characteristic of the style of the Gita, that the :
Lord briefly repeats the main idea of the preceding verse in the
next one also, which is of great help to a striver. Performance
of action without attachment explained in the preceding verse,
is explained in brief in this verse by the expression 'Karmana _
eva’. Similarly, He will explain the main point, described in the
sixth verse of the twelfth chapter, again in the seventh verse in
brief, in the expression, ""Whose mind is set on Me"". °

Here the Lord instead of the expresssion 'Karmana eva’,
could have used the expression ""Yogena eva’. But here the topic -
is of the performance of action without attachment. Therefore,
the Lord has used this expression, which suits the context. |

In fact, the sentient Lord cannot be realized through insentient :
actions alone. The stumbling block to God-realization is removed -
through the performance of action, without attachment. Then the
all-pervading God is realized.

Generally people think that they can attain God, by performing
action or by making effort. They hold that, as they have to make
a lot of effort in order to meet a high officer, they will have to
make much more effort, (in the form of penance, fasts etc.,) in
order to attain God, Who is the Lord of infinite universes. But
that is an error on their part.
"
366,"Verse 20] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 325

Human life has a great affinity for actions. So in the Gita it
is mentioned, ""Meeting death when passion prevails, the embodied
soul, is born among those attached to action"" (14/15). Therefore, -
a man has an inclination for action and he wants to attain his .
aim through actions. He believes that as the worldly things can
be acquired through actions, so God could also be realised by
action. So he tries to attain Him through action. But the fact is, |
that the Imperishable Lord cannot be attained by actions. Only .
the perishable worldly things, can be acquired through actions,
because all actions are performed with the help of a perishable -
(body, senses and mind etc.,) while God is realized by total
renunciation of affinity for the perishable.

Every action has a beginning and an end, so its fruit is -
also perishable. A thing which is at some distance (unacquired), _
with the point of view of space or time can be acquired by
action. Thus, only the worldly things which are perishable,
changeful and confined, can be acquired through action. But -
the Lord Who pervades everywhere and Who is uniform and
imperishable, cannot be attained through action. He is naturally _
attainable. Worldly things cannot be acquired by thinking alone
but the Lord can be realised by thought, because He is close to
us. The fact is, that the Lord is not attained by thinking alone, :
but when a striver thinks of the Lord, he stops thinking of the ;
world. As soon as thinking about the world is renounced, the
ever attainable Lord is realized. ~ :

Not only the all-pervading God, is never away from us but His
being away from us, is impossible also. He is much nearer, these
even the supposedly close T'ness, which is limited spatially and
temporally, but God knows no limitation. In order to experience
such a close and ever available God, it is deceiving one's self,
to apply logic and arguments as if it were a worldly object.

Worldly things cannot be acquired only by having a keen
desire, while God can be realized, only by having a keen desire.
"
367,"326 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 >
Human life is meant to have a keen desire for God-realization,
not for sense enjoyment. This desire is not aroused, because
man has. a desire for worldly pleasures and prosperity. If desire
for pleasure and prosperity is renounced, a keen desire for .
God-realization may be aroused instantly and God may also be
realized immediately. ,

It is necessary to clearly understand, the difference between
the ‘aim’ and the desire, for fruit. God-realization is the aim :
of human life, while desire to acquire perishable things, is the
desire for fruit of action. An aim is achieved, while desire for
fruit of action is wiped out. Self-realization or God-realization
is the aim, rather than the fruit. Action which is performed in
order to attain an aim, cannot be called an action with ‘desire
for fruit’. Therefore, a Karmayogi performs all actions, with an _
objective rather than with a desire for fruit.

In Karmayoga (Discipline of Action), prescribed actions
are performed with the aim of renouncing affinity for actions
(matter). Such a striver performs actions for the welfare of
others, by renouncing selfish desire for fruit, while a common -
man performs actions for himself, with the desire for fruit. In

_. the case of the latter, the action is turned into fruit and so the

fruit has its affinity for the action; while aim has no affinity for
action. When a striver performs action for the welfare of others, .
without expecting any reward, his misconception that the Lord
is far away from him, is removed.

'Lokasangrahamevapi sampasyankartumarhasi'—The word
‘loka’ includes three aspects—({1) Human world (2) Creatures of
the world (3) All the scriptures (except the Vedas). Performance
of actions (of daily routine) for the human world and its creatures,
according to the ordinance of the scriptures is 'Lokasangraha’'
(maintenance of the world).

‘Lokasangraha’ means to persuade the people to turn to the
real, by dissuading them from the unreal. If a great soul, through
"
368,"Verse 20] _ SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 327 |
his word and action, persuades people to turn towards the real,
from_the unreal, it leads them to salvation. |
If he performs his duty merely as a show, it is not 7
‘lokasangraha’. He should perform his duty sincerely, according
to his caste, order of life and sect etc.
No action is as such either superior or inferior. Whatever |
action is performed, according to one's caste, order of life, sect,
time and circumstances, is regarded as superior. Actions are :
regarded as superior and inferior according to their form and
fruit.* When desire for fruit is renounced, all actions lead to
perfection or God-realization. As far as renunciation of affinity
for the insentient (matter) is concernedj all actions—superior or
inferior, are of equal importance. |
No one can live without the help of others. A body is acquired ~
from the parents; knowledge and education is received from
preceptors. Food stuff, clothes, a house and other necessities of
life, are prepared by others. Thus everyone has to depend on |
others for his necessities. Therefore, every person is indebted to
others. In order to get out of this debt, he has to perform his duty -
for the welfare of others, without any selfish motive. When he
does not regard the body and other worldly objects in the least |
as his own or for him, he is freed from the debt. :
Appendix—Here the expression ‘Karmanaiva hi sarnsiddhi- ;
masthitah’ proves that Karmayoga is an independent discipline for
salvation. The kings such as Janaka etc., also attained perfection by
performing actions because they ruled over their empire in order to
serve others and to comfort them rather than for their selfish end. |
‘lokasangrahamevapi sampaSyankartumarhasi’—this expression
means that you should set an example to the people that by
practising Karmayoga supreme goal is attained.
* Oratory is regarded as superior to sweeping. Less charity seems to bear
less fruit while more charity seems to bear more fruit.

own, because by doing so, his egoism is nourished which is an
obstacle to self-realization. The feelings, ""I am a renouncer,"" -
""I am dispassionate,” ""I am a devotee"" and ""I am a knower""
nourish his egoism and thus these are stumbling blocks to Self- |
realization. There is no personal ego at all in a Self-realized :
person the prime ego remains only for common dealings and is ""
engaged in rendering service to the world, as it belongs to the
world (Gita 7/4; 13/5).

The body, riches, family, position, ability and authority —
etc., which have been provided to us by the world, are neither
meant for our pleasure nor for our possession, but these are
for service of others. He who enjoys these himself, is verily a
thief (Gita 3/12). All of these belong to the world and so great
men utilize these in rendering service to the world. They have
a natural inclination, for the welfare of all beings. |

The feeling of selflessness, causes unity and love, while a So
"
370,"Verse 21] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 329 |
feeling of selfishness, causes strife, the former, leads to salvation
while the latter. to degradation. By regarding the body as T',
""Mine’ and ‘For me’ the feeling of selfishness, is caused. Great . = _
men who do not accept a feeling of affinity for the body, have .
no selfish motive. So all their actions, are for the welfare of
others. The sight, touch, talk and thinking of such ‘great men,
automatically lead to the welfare of people. Even, the air which
touches them does good to the people. .
Such great men are of two kinds—(1) 'Avadhiita’—the
hermit kind, who lead.a holy and lonely life; such hermits are -
ideal only as hermits, not for common folk. (2) 'Acarya'—Model
for others—who are an example to others. Their actions are,
according to the scriptural injunctions. They have neither egoism |
nor a sense of ‘mine’. Their actions are automatically performed, -
for the welfare of the world. They leave their sweet smell by
destroying bad smell, just like a blooming flower. Such great
men have their identity with the Lord, because. both of them
work for the welfare of the entire world.
Different limbs of a body, constitute the body and remain -
ever prepared to help one another. When anyone is injured, and
they consider its recovery as that of the entire body. Similarly,
all the beings of the world, in spite of being different, are one .
and the same, and the performance of duty by one, 1s for the -
welfare of the entire. world.
As far as actions and words of the great men, are concerned,
they leave a gross impression which is restricted, because actions
are limited. But, as far as their feelings are concerned, their
influence is subtle and limitless, as the feelings are limitless. They
set examples for other people, by performing duty, according to
their caste, social order, sect etc., and make a strong impression
on others.
Though a great man does not perform any action for himself,
as he has no pride of doership, yet people feel that he performs
"
371,"330 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
actions. So the term ‘acarati' (Doer) has been used. Actions are
automatically performed by him, for the welfare of others, without

any selfish motive. Though he has nothing to do (Gita 3/17), and _
has no egoism (Gita 2/71), yet duty is naturally and efficiently .
performed by him, which is automatically for the welfare of

the entire world. . : | , :

It is generally observed, that whatever actions are performed
and whatever standards are set, by great men these are followed ”
by common people. a

Common people who attach importance to wealth and
position, follow the examples set by millionaires and leaders,
regarding them as great, though they may not be really so. The _
rich people and leaders, resort to evil practices such as falsehood,
forgery, dishonesty, thefts and corruption, to gain riches, fame
and status in society. The common people who consider them :
great, follow those evil practices. Thus, evils become rampant
in the society, without any schooling or teaching.

How shocking and surprising it is, that at present a millionaire
is regarded as great, but a devotee, who chants the name of the |
Lord a hundred thousand times a day, is not considered great. :
People do not think that when a millionaire dies, he will not take -
a single penny with him, while the whole wealth of chanting of
the Lord's name, will ultimately go with the devotee.

Great and noble men, such as teachers, preachers, priests, .
leaders and rulers etc., who hold positions of honour in society, ;
should perform their duties very carefully, so that they may leave a
good impression upon other people, who may follow the standards
set by noble men. They are just like drivers, who carry the
passengers to their destinations or might cause accidents.

‘Sa yatpramanam kurute lokastadanuvartate'—A great man
is free from such evils as desire, feeling of mine, attachment,
"
372,"Verse 21] | SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 331 |

selfishness and favouritism and he does not attach importance ;

to perishable objects. His word automatically, influences people

and they follow his preaching. |
Here a doubt may arise, why the Lord has used, 'He sets a .

standard’ and also 'Whatever a great man does’ when either one

of these might have been sufficient. The clarification is, that

though the deed is important, yet a great man cannot perform

acts of the people from different castes, orders of life etc. He |

sets a standard by his word, quoting scriptures and historical

_ Characters, so that people of other castes, orders of life and creed -

etc., by performing their duty, sincerely and promptly may attain

perfection (Gita 18/45). By following his advice, they start to

perform their duty according to their castes, creeds and orders

of life etc. -
Though the scope of such deeds is limited while that of

standard set (word) is wide, yet the Lord has used, five terms

""Yat', ‘Yat’, ‘Tat’, 'Tat' and (specially) ‘Eva’, for the deeds of a ”

great man. He has used only two terms 'Yat' and 'Tat' for the

standard set by him. It means that the deeds of a great man :

have five times the effect, while standard set (word) has only

twice the effect. Therefore, the Lord in the twentieth verse of

this chapter, has laid special emphasis, on the performance of |

duty, for the welfare of the world. .
If a great man instead of performing his duty, according

to his caste, creed and stage of life etc.,; preaches the gospel as

a (standard) only, it will not influence people. They will think

that these are merely precepts, which need not be translated

into practice, because the man himself is only preaching, not |

practising. Therefore, a great man has to do good to the people

by performing his duty, as well as by setting standards i.e.,

through word.
Only those people, who have faith in a great man follow

his deeds and the set standard (word). But if a person does not
"
373,"332 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
regard a great man as really great, he will not follow the deeds
and standard (word) set by him.

In modern times people do not have much inclination for -
Spiritualism, in spite of a lot of preaching. The reason is, that .
preachers themselves, do not practise, what they preach. So it
is a shot in the air. But on the other hand, there are preachers |
who believe in the maxim ""Example is better than precept.""
Their shot hits the target and inspires men to practise spiritual
discipline. Spiritual discourses leave some impression on almost
everyone, but those who are devotees and have reverence, are -
immensely benefited.

There is nothing in the three worlds, O Arjuna, that is for me

yet I engage Myself, in action. 22 -
Comment:—

_ ‘Na me parthasti kartavyam trisu lokesu kificana nanavaptam-
avaptavyam'—The Lord is not confined to one world. So He is
saying that there is nothing in the three worlds, that should be ;
done by Him. All men, beasts and birds etc., perform actions,
in order to attain something or the other. But the Lord mentions
here, an uncommon fact, that He also performs action, though
there is nothing which should be done or attained by Him.

Though God has nothing to do for Himself, yet He incarnates
for the welfare of others and performs action for the protection of
"
374,"Verse 22] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 333 |
the good, for the destruction of the wicked and for the establishment
of righteousness (Gita 4/8). The Lord creates the universe, also
for the salvation of creatures. He has created heavens, so that .
beings may reap the fruit of their virtuous actions. Eighty-four .
lac, forms of lives and hells, have been created, so.that beings
may reap the fruit of their evil actions, while human lifé-has been
created so that a human being, having transcended virtues and .
vices, may attain salvation viz., God-realization. This is possible,
only when he does nothing for himself. All his activities—actions,
with the gross body, thinking with the subtle body and trance -
with the causal body, should be applied to the welfare of the
world. The reason is, that this threefold body, is not of one's own,
but it belongs to the world. Therefore, a Karmayogi considers
the body, senses, mind, intellect and all the matter etc., of the
world, (which in fact belong to the world) and he utilizes them -
im rendering service to the world. If he uses these in order to
enjoy pleasures, he commits a blunder. When a person accepts ,
worldly things as his own he wants to reap the fruit and in
order to reap the fruit, he has to perform action. Thus, so long -
as a man perform action in order to attain something, his duty
remains to be performed by him.

If we give a serious thought to the subject, we realise that :
a man has to do nothing for himself, because God Who is to be -
attained is ever-attainable and the self is eternal while actions and
their fruits are perishable. So, how can the perishable (actions
and their fruits) have their affinity for the imperishable (self)?
Actions have their affinity for the body and the world, rather
than the self. Therefore, there is nothing to be done for the self.
When there is nothing to be done for the self, how can there be
anything to do for God?

While talking about an enlightened soul, who has attained
perfection through the Discipline of Action, the Lord (in the
seventeenth and eighteenth verses of this chapter) declared, ""There
"
375,"334 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
_ exists no action to be done, by such an enlightened soul who

is delighted, satisfied and contented, in the self. Such a soul

has nothing to do with the performance or non-performance of __

actions, and he has not the least affinity for selfishness, with any |

being. Yet he performs actions for the welfare of the world.""

Similarly, the Lord declares, for Himself, there is nothing that

should be done by Him, yet He is engaged in action for the

welfare of the world. It means that an enlightened soul becomes

identical with the Lord (Gita 14/2) and as the Lord is a model

in the three worlds (Gita 3/23; 4/11), similarly an enlightened .

soul is a model in this world (Gita 3/25).

“Varta eva ca karmani'——Here, the Lord by the term ‘eva’
(only) means to say, that He performs actions enthusiastically,
promptly, carefully and thoroughly.

As the compartments of a train attached to an engine, follow -
the engine, similarly the Lord and the saints (who have nothing
to do and nothing more to attain), perform their duty and other sy.
people follow them. These latter people have a desire to act and
to attain, something or the other. They get rid of this desire by
performing their duty, without expecting any reward. If the Lord -
and the saints, did not perform their duty, the people would also
follow their path, and they would become indolent and heedless
and would perform forbidden actions. So they would not get rid
of desires. Therefore, duty is automatically performed by the Lord ""
and the saints, for the welfare of the whole humanity.

As the Lord always performs His duty, He never abandons
it, similarly a striver should always perform his duty, so that he
may attain God easily. If an aspirant does not perform his duty, .
he remains deprived of God-realization. ,

Comment:—
[In the twenty-second verse, the Lord by a positive inference,
laid emphasis on the performance of duty. In this verse, He by .
the negative inference, mentions the harm that would be done _
if He did not perform duty.] Bo
'Yadi hyaham na varteyam jatu karmanyatandritah'—The
term 'Hi' has been used here to support the expression ""I engage
Myself in action"", used in the preceding verse. ;
The Lord declares that it is impossible for Him, not to perform
action. But if it is so assumed that He does not perform action—in
this sense the expression ""Yadi jatu' (If ever) has been used.
The term ‘atandritah’ means, that actions should be
performed, very carefully and promptly, renouncing indolence
and heedlessness. By doing so, affinity for actions is renounced.
"
377,"336 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA - [Chapter3
As a stiff twig is easily broken but an elastic one cannot be easily
broken. Similarly, ‘affinity for actions is renounced, if these are
performed, carefully and promptly, but these are not renounced |
if performed, indolently and heedlessly. Therefore, the Lord (in ;
the nineteenth verse) has used the term 'Samacara' (Perform well)
and here the term ‘atandritah' (unwearied), has been used.
If there is recollection of an action, time and again, it means,
that there has been some fault (desire, attachment, incompletion, :
indolence, heedlessness, indifference etc.,) in the performance of
that action and so affinity for it, has not been renounced. :
""Mama vartmanuvartante manusy4h partha sarvasah'—By this
expression; the Lord seems to declare that those who follow His —
path really deserve to be called human beings, while those who
while away time because of indolence and heedlessness, and _
demand their rights, do not deserve to be called human beings
even though in human-garb.
In the twenty-first verse of this chapter, the Lord declared, .
""Whatever a great man does, the same is done by others as well;
and whatever standard he sets, is followed by others,"" while here, . -
He declares, ""Men in everyway follow My path"". It means that
a great man is a model for the human world only, while the
Lord is a model for the three worlds. | ,
' The Lord incarnates in the world, to set an example to. -
other people. He who does not live for himself, and knows
the art of living, in the world. The world is an educational
institution, where we have to learn how to do good to others,
by renouncing desire, attachment and selfishness etc. Through
this lesson, we have to attain salvation. The only aim of human ©
life, is to perform our duty by serving others and doing good
to them, including members of the own family and try to lead
one another, to salvation.
_  ""Utsideyurime loka na kuryam karma cedaham'—The Lord (in
the twenty-third verse) explained the harm if He performed action
"
378,"Verse 23-24] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 337 ;
unweariedly and now (in the twenty-fourth verse) He explains
the harm that could be done if he did not perform action.

‘Though, it is not possible for the Lord not to perform action, |
yet if it is so assumed’—in this sense the Lord has used the :
term ‘Cet’ (If)—this expression means, that a man should not be
attached to inaction (Gita 2/47). Therefore, the Lord by citing His
own example says, that He performs action even though there is
nothing unattained, which remains to be attained by Him. And |
if He did not perform action (according to the caste and order
of life in which He has incarnated), He would be the creator of
confusion of castes and cause destruction of the people. It is so,
because by renouncing their duty, men will also got steeped in
the mode of ignorance (Gita 14/18).

The Lord is a model for the three worlds and all beings ~
follow Him. Therefore, if the Lord does not perform His duty,
no one in the three worlds, will perform his duty and thus they
will suffer a downfall. :

‘Sankarasya ca karta syamupahanyamimah prajah'—If the
Lord did not perform action (duty), these worlds would perish 7
and He would be the root cause of their destruction, but this is _
not at all possible.

The term 'sankara’ stands for the mixture of two castes. |
Arjuna (in the fortieth and the forty-first verses of the first :
chapter) said, ""If I fight the family will be ruined. With the
ruin of the family, the immemorial religious rites of the family
will be destroyed. With the destruction of the religious rites,
impiety will overcome the whole family. By the prevalence of
impiety, the women of the family will become immoral. With
the corruption of women, mixing of castes (intermingling of
castes) will result."" Thus, Arjuna meant to say, that war would
lead to the mixing of castes.* But the Lord contradicts Arjuna's

* Even according to the argument of Arjuna, non-performance of duty
(action) is the cause of confusion of castes. Confusion of castes arises only when
"
379,"338 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA _ [Chapter3

statement, by citing His own example when He declares that :

confusion of castes, would arise by the non-performance of duty.

Therefore, here Lord Krsna seems to urge Arjuna to wage the

war, otherwise he would be the creator of mixed castes. | :
| An Important Fact. a

The Lord, answers Arjuna's question, ""Why do You urge ,
me to engage in this terrible action?"" In the twenty-second, the
twenty-third and the twenty-fourth verses, by citing His own
example that He engages Himself in action even though He has -
nothing to do personally with it and nothing to attain in the three
worlds. Therefore, He urges him to be engaged in action.

The Lord gives Arjuna a hint, that He had agreed to be |
his chariot-driver and he as His chariot-warrior is performing -
His duty very carefully and efficiently, so that other people
may follow His example as He stands as a model for them. So
he should also perform his duty as a Ksatriya (member of the “
warrior class) carefully and efficiently.

women are corrupted and they become so by non-performance of their duty. If
women believe that they should perform their duty by remaining chaste, in the
same way as their husbands performed their duty by sacrificing their lives, they
cannot neglect their duty. Thus by performing their duty, they will maintain their
chastity and there will be no mixing of castes.

Comment:— :
'‘Saktah karmanyavidvamso yatha kurvanti bharata'—The

expression 'saktah avidvarhsah' has been used, for those ignorant

men attached to worldly pleasures, who have full faith in the

scriptures, the ordinance of the scriptures and also the actions -

sanctioned by the scriptures, and who are neither enlightened

nor vile but are attached to actions, pleasures and objects. They

are called ignorant (unwise) because of their desire, though they :

have bookish knowledge of the scriptures. They are well-read

but are not enlightened. They are called ignorant, because they -

perform actions for themselves.

Such ignorant people, perform their duty scrupulously |
according to the ordinance of the scriptures without heedlessness -
and indolence believing that it will not bear fruit, if duty is not
performed scrupulously according to strict scriptural ordinance.

The Lord urges wise people, to act in the same way, without

attachment for the welfare of the world. _ |

'Kuryadvidvarnstathasaktascikirsurlokasangraham'— ‘asaktah’ .
and 'Vidvan'—unattached wise men, are enlightened souls* who

are totally free from desire, a feeling, of ‘mine’, lust, favouritism,

* The supreme state (of God-realization) which is obtained by men of
renunciation is also attained by men of action (Gita 5/4-5), yet in that state also
there is a little difference in their marks and natures according to the path each

381,"340 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3_~
selfishness etc., and who have not the least attachment, to body
and other objects etc.

The expression 'Lokasangraham cikirsuh’ (wishing the welfare |
of the world) has been used for the expression 'Lokasangrahamh
evapi sathpasyan' (with a view to the welfare of the masses)
used in the twentieth verse of this chapter and explained, in the
twenty-first verse. | SO

All actions of wise men, are naturally performed for the
welfare of the world. They have also no egoistic notion, that
they are engaged in the welfare of others. As a licentious person, ~
is attached to sensual pleasures, the greedy to riches and an
infatuated one to the family, the wise are engrossed, in the welfare
of all beings, naturally and without any egoistic feeling. Because
of the total renunciation of affinity, for the materialistic world, -
their so-called bodies, senses, minds and intellects etc., are |
inclusive of the term ‘loka’ (world) used in the expression,
'lokasangraha' (welfare of the world). | .

People think that such wise men have a desire to be engrossed
in the welfare of the world, but in fact they have no desire at all. _
They regard the body, senses, mind, intellect, objects, position,
riches, ability and all other resources, as of the world and for
the world, which these really are. So all of them, automatically —__-
remain engaged in rendering service to the world, without any .
expectation of reward. | |

The terms, ‘yatha' (as) and ‘tatha' (so), have been used, to
point out that as ignorant men scrupulously act for their selfish
motive, so the wise should act, without attachment, aiming at the
welfare of the world. When the wise perform actions thus for __
the welfare and salvation of all beings, good and sweet feelings,
automatically propagate.
followed. The men of renunciation remain indifferent to actions while men of
action perform actions very promptly. This difference is not hard and fast. It is
found in some realized souls.
"
382,"Verse 25-26] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 341 ”
An ignorant person performs action scrupulously, in order :
to reap its fruit, while a wise man is neither attached to the fruit
of action, nor has any duty to perform. So, it is possible for him
to be indifferent to action. Therefore, the Lord directs him to
act, without attachment. 7 -
In the twenty-first verse, a great (wise) man was called a
model, but here he has been called a follower. It means that
a wise man may either be a leader (model) or a follower, as
automatically good to the world is done by him. For example,
Lord Rama preaches a gospel to His subjects and also goes into -
exile by obeying His father. In both cases, welfare of the world
is done by Him because He has nothing to do either with the
performance or non-performance of such actions.
A wise man who performs actions without attachment, having _
no desire for its fruit, automatically leaves an impression on
the ignorant people, who are attached to action, whether it is
clearly noted or not. Not only people, but beasts and birds are -
also influenced by such feelings and actions.
So long as, a man does not perform prescribed actions
without desire for fruit, his cycle of birth and death continues. .
As long as, he works for himself, he has to act, because the self .
is eternal, but an action and its fruit are perishable. Therefore, it
is everyone's obligatory duty, to work for the welfare of others,
without any selfish motive.
The Discipline of Action (performance of action without
desire for fruit) seems difficult, because we attach importance .
to the worldly objects. If we resolve, that we have to perform
all actions for the welfare of others without any desire, the path
of action will become easy, and quick.
In fact, there is no importance as such of the object, rather
it is of its use. That use is significant, only when one does not
"
383,"342 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA | _ (Chapter3
attach much value to the object. No worldly object is personal, _
it belongs to the world. But it has been given to us, so that we
may make a proper use of it. When we regard it as our own, it
-becomes difficult for us to use it for the welfare of others. In |
fact, it is neither an object nor an action which leads to bondage
but it is attachment to it which binds. |
_The wise, perform actions for the welfare of the world
_ without any egoistic notion, because they hold that whatsoever _
possessions such as body, senses, mind, intellect, position etc.,
have been acquired from the world, and these belong to the ~-
world. So it is honest on our part, to use the worldly-materials,
in the service of humanity; there is nothing creditable in returning
trust money to its owner. In doing so, we are simply relieved
of our responsibility—a debt has been repaid. In like manner,
by using our possessions in the service of the world, we merely __
repay the debt we owe to the world, since it is only from the
_ world, that we have received these possessions.

""Na buddhibhedam janayedajianam karmasanginam
josayetsarvakarmani vidvanyuktah samacaran'—A wise man |
without attachment, who has been described in the twenty-fifth
verse by the expression 'Asaktah vidvan,' has been called ""Yuktah
vidvan' here. : |

An enlightened soul, who remains, equanimous, is unmoved
under all circumstances, whose senses are controlled and to whom
a clod, a stone and a piece of gold, are same, is called 'Yuktah
Vidvan' (wise man established in the self) (Gita 6/8).

Ignorant men attached to prescribed action, who have been
described in the twenty-fifth verse by the expression ‘Saktah —
Avidvarsah' have been called by the expression 'Karmasanginam
Ajnanam' here. These people have been called 'KarmasangTt
(attached to action) and ‘ajfiant (Ignorant), because they perform
action prescribed by the scriptures, for themselves, (in order to
gain pleasure, honour and praise etc.)
"
384,"Verse 25-26] | + SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 343 -
Great men have greater responsibility, because common men
follow them. Therefore, the Lord urges the wise man, that he
should not perform any such action or make any such utterance,
as may lead the ignorant to a downfall, which has been called |
here ‘as buddhibhedam’ (unsettlement in the minds). Therefore, a -
wise man should perform virtuous actions, according to his caste
and order of life for the welfare of other people, so that they |
may be inspired to perform their duty, without any desire for |
fruit. This rule also applies to important persons of society and
a family that they should perform their duties scrupulously, and -
they may set an example for other members of society and family.
Some of the examples, of unsettling the minds of ignorant
people, are as follows:—
1. Knowledge is superior to action. Actions bind a man. -
This type of preaching undermines faith im action. |
2. Everybody performs actions with a selfish motive. Desire
for fruit is natural, Why should a man perform action, if he -
has, no desire for its fruit? Such thoughts unsettle the minds of
ignorant people. :
3. When a person performs actions, with the desire for their
fruits, he has to take birth again and again, to reap the fruit of
his actions. Thus common people cease to have faith in the fruit |
of action. Such statements unsettles the minds of ignorant people. -
Consequently, they renounce the performance of virtuous actions,
even though they remain attached to their fruit.
The fact is, that it is not action, but attachment, which leads
to bondage. Thus an enlightened soul instead of confusing the
minds of ignorant people, should perform his obligatory duty,
according to his caste and order of life and also get it performed
by others, so that they, instead of having a downfall, may rise
to a higher level. He should admire their virtuous actions, and
make them aware of the evil actions, so that they may renounce
these. Moreover, he should explain to them, that it is not proper |

385,"344 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
to have a desire for the fruit of virtuous actions, such as: sacrifice,
charity and adoration etc., because this fruit is nominal. It is just
like selling a precious jewel for the price of pebbles and so it
is not a wise act. But if they act without desire for fruit, it will _
lead them to bliss. | :
Similarly, he should not. confuse the minds of ignorant people,
_ about adoration and spiritual practice. Generally, people say that
it is futile to chant the Lord’s name, without concentration. But
an enlightened soul should preach, that chanting of the Lord's ©
name never goes in vain. But if the name is chanted with ~
concentration, it expedites spiritual progress. Everyone possesses
some virtue or the other. Therefore, when an enlightened soul
wants to preach a sermon to a common man, he instead of
reproaching and insulting him, should praise his virtues and _
' then should preach the sermon. Such a sermon makes a strong
impression, upon the common man. The chief of a family or the
society should also do the same. . ) :
_ The Lord through the terms 'samacaran' (duly performing)
and ‘josayet' (should get them to perform) directs a wise man -
(i) to perform his duty, scrupulously according to the scriptural
injunctions, (ii) he should make the ignorant men, who are
attached to action, perform their duty. |
. Qstentation in the performance of actions is hypocrisy,  -
which is a mark of demoniac nature (Gita 16/4). Therefore, the
Lord orders people to perform actions, not for show, but for
the welfare of the people. An enlightened soul should set other
people, who are attached to action, to act by performing their
duty scrupulously, without attachment and also by preaching _
a sermon. He should inspire them to discard selfishness, and
also inspire them through his example and precepts, to perform
prescribed actions and to refrain from forbidden actions.
Appendix—Enlightened exalted souls and God—both are
free from egoistic notion. Therefore they perform their duty
"
386,"Verse 27] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 345 :
for the welfare of others, not for themselves. A striver should
do nothing for himself because in the self there is no sense
of doership. The act of deviating the people from the sinful
(wrong) path and directing them towards the virtuous (right)
path is welfare of others. The method of the welfare of others :
is—to act according to the ordinance of the scriptures; but a
striver from within should have the feeling that he has to do
nothing for himself. But he should not divulge the fact among :
people that he dees nothing for himself. | |

All actions are performed, in all cases, by the modes of -

""I am the doer."" 27
Comment:—
'Prakrteh kriyamanani gunaih karmani sarvasah'—All the :
functions of the world, such as birth and growth of bodies and
plants, flow of the Ganges and changes in worldly things etc.,
as well actions, such as seeing, hearing, eating and drinking etc.,
are carried out by the modes of nature. But, a man deluded by |
egoism divides all activities performed by cosmic energy, into
two parts—To the first part, belong actions, which he thinks he
does not perform but occur naturally—such as formation of the
body and digestion of food etc. The second part, consists of those
actions which he thinks he performs, such as seeing, speaking
and eating etc. A man out of delusion regards himself as the |
"
387,"346 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
doer of the latter class of actions. Intellect, ego, mind, five subtle
elements, ten organs of perception and actions, and five objects
of senses—these are also called the modes of nature, because _
they are the evolutes of the three modes. of nature, (goodness,
passion and ignorance). The Lord declares that all actions are
performed by the modes of nature, not by the self. _

'‘Ahankaravimiidhatma'—Egoism' is a state of mind, while he
(the self) is the knower of that state. But by an error, he identifies
the self with that state, and. thus he is deluded by egoism.

As a body denoted by the term ‘Idam’, is different from the
self, so is egoism. ‘Idam' cannot be 'I'—this is the rule. But, when
he regards egoism as self, he is known as ‘ahankaravimudhatma’
(one whose mind is deluded by egoism). This assumed egoism
is not wiped out by efforts, as these involve the ego. But, itis _
wiped out by non-acceptance viz., non-assumption.

Egoism is of two kinds:— :

(i) Real* as 'T am’ (relating to one's existence). -

(ii) Unreal (assumed)—as 'I am body’. |

‘Real egoism' is natural and eternal, while unreal egoism',
is unnatural and perishable. Real egoism, can be forgotten but
cannot perish, while unreal egoism may appear, but cannot exist. _
A man commits an error, that he forgets real egoism (self) and
assumes the unreal egoism (I am the body) to be true.

'Kartahamiti manyate'—Though all actions are performed by
modes of nature, yet a person whose mind is deluded by egoism, _-

* Real egoism in fact is not egoism. It 1s an aggregate of Truth, Knowledge
and Bliss. It-is called, ‘real’, because it never changes, while the unreal egoism,
changes. Today a man is uneducated. Having received schooling he says he is
educated. Thus the unreal egoism changes. But he (the self) remains the same.
As soon as he ceases to identify himself with the unreal egoism, the real egoism,
as the aggregate of Truth, Consciousness and Bliss, remains. :
"
388,"Verse 27] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 347 -
thinks that he is the doer, because he regards egoism, as the self.
It is because of this egoism that he identifies the self with the
body, senses, mind and thus regards the self as the doer. This
egoism is self-made and so it can be eliminated by the self. The
method, to throw it out is, through non-assumption. This false :
assumption, can be rooted out, if he realizes that he (the self)
is different from the body, senses and mind etc.
Performance of actions and non-performance of actions—all
are activities. Sleeping, waking, sitting, walking and trance etc.,
are included in activities, which take place in nature, while the 7
self is free from performance and non-performance of actions. The
self is the illuminator and knower of them. A man automatically
remains established in the self, but the self assumes its affinity
for actions. This assumed affinity, is called 'egoism’. -
AS a wave is a part of an ocean, so the ocean and the wave a
belong to the same class. Similarly a body, a fragment of the
world and the world, belong to the same class. The soul (self) :
is different from the world or the body. Man does not take the
world, to be his own Self 'T’ but he does take, even though |
wrongly, his body to be so. a
Just as a wave without an ocean, has no independent
existence of its own, similarly, without the world, there cannot
be any separate existence of the body. But, when a man, whose
mind is deluded by egoism, identifies the self with the body,
several desires are born in him, as he has desire for family,
riches, praise and pleasures etc. He does not realize, that by
identifying the self with the body, he is already a captive and
these desires will strengthen the bondage and will hurl him into
the abyss of adversity.
Even though a striver during his disciplining period, may
not feel that he is above and beyond the modes of prakrti but
"
389,"348 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3  -
when he accepts to be so with a strong faith, he starts feeling _
himself beyond prakrti. Thus, just as a person, is bound due to
his“ wrong assumptions, in the same way he is freed from his
_ shackles through correct assumptions, because it is a principle
that an assumed fact, ceases to be by unassuming it. The same ~
fact, has been pointed out by the Lord, in the eighth verse of
the fifth chapter by the term 'manyeta' (should believe) when He
declares, ""The man, who is united with the Divine and knows
the truth, thinks that he does nothing at all"". By such thinking,
a striver realizes the truth. -
When even the unreal assumptions such as 'I am the body’,
'I am doer’, become so steady, that it seems difficult to renounce
_ these; why would the reality, 'I am not the body' and 'I am not
a doer’, not become steady? And once the reality is confirmed,
how can it be abandoned? -
Appendix—aAll actions take place in the material realm. In the
sentient realm there is no action at all. He whose mind is beguiled
by egoism thinks “I am the doer.” “The mind being beguiled by _
egoism’ means to assume the self’s identity with ego, a fragment
of Apara (lower or insentient) Prakrti (nature) viz., to assume -
ego as the self (1 am this). This is known identification.
He who regards himself as the doer is sentient but he regards
the insentient ‘ego’ as the ‘self’. It means that he whoregardsego_- -
as the self, who assumes himself unipresent, is in facta fragment  -
of God. In that self no sense of doership is possible (Gita 13/29).
In fact the self can’t be identified with the body—“‘Sarirastho’ pi
kaunteya na karoti na lipyate’ (Gita 13/31) but he assumes his
identification with the body ‘kartahamitimanyate’. In fact there _
is no identification, it is merely an assumption. It means that
the self does not become a doer but there is only assumption of
doership due to lack of discrimination—‘manyate’. As soon:as
he thinks himself to be the doer, scriptural sanction-prohibition
applies to him and he has to become the enjoyer (experiencer)
of the fruit of action.
"
390,"Verse 27] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 349 -
In the self there 1s no action. An action takes place where |
there is some empty space. How can an action take place in the
solid self? But when a person assumes himself to be a doer, the
action Of Prakrti, with which he accepts his relationship, bears
fruit for him, which he has to endure. The reason is that he, ~
who is a doer, is an experiencer.
The self has no relationship at all with any ‘Karaka’
(case). Therefore in the self there is not even an iota of doership.
The realm of doership is different. By now the actions which
have been performed in the species of gods, men, animals, birds, -
gnomes and devils etc., out of them no action could have an |
access to the self, nor the body could have an access to the
self, because the division of action and object (body) 1s quite
different, from the division of the self. But without attaching
importance to this discrimination, a man gets bound by action ~
and its fruit. |
He who feels that something is to be done, has affinity with _
ego because without the sense of doership no action is possible.
The sense of doership crops up as one thinks of doing something.
With the sense of doership, there is performance of action and -
by performing an action, the sense of doership is strengthened.
Therefore by practising the spiritual discipline being an agent
a striver can’t be free from egoism. An action done with the
sense of egoism, can never lead to salvation, because egoism is
the root of all misfortunes, of birth and death. If actions are not
performed for one’s own self, affinity for egoism does not persist
viz., affinity for the entire nature (Prakrti) is renounced. Therefore
a striver instead of attaching importance to the performance of
action, should attach importance to discrimination. By attaching
importance to discrimination, discrimination is naturally revealed
clearly and it guides a seeker. Afterwards this discrimination is
transformed into Real-Knowledge. :

tattvavittu mahabaho gunakarmavibhagayoh

puna gunesu vartanta iti matva na_ sajjate ~

Having true knowledge of the respective spheres of modes
(guna) and actions, the knowing soul does not get attached with
them, by realising that, it is an interplay of the modes. 28
Comment:— 7

'Tattvavittu mahabaho gunakarmavibhagayoh'—Here the -
term 'Tu' (but) has been used to distinguish the enlightened soul,
from the person whose mind is deluded by egoism, as described
in the preceding verse. ,

The three modes of goodness, of passion and of ignorance,
are born of nature. The entire universe, including the body, senses, 7
mind, intellect, creatures and objects etc., is constituted of the
three modes. This is the sphere of the modes of nature. Actions -
performed with body etc., is a sphere of action.

The modes (objects) and actions, are ever-changing and .
transitory. The matter, has its origin and end; actions have a
beginning and end. To know this fact properly is, having a true
knowledge of modes and actions, along with their divisions. This |
is the truth, about the modes of nature and their actions. The
soul, (self) never undergoes any action. It is ever unconnected
and changeless i. e., it has no connection with things and actions.

This is the truth about the soul.

The ignorant, when he assumes his relation, with the two
spheres of modes and actions, gets himself bound. Philosophically, .
the main reason of this bondage is ignorance, but from the stand-
point of a striver, the main cause is, ‘attachment.’ Attachment
is, a lack of discrimination. It perishes when discrimination is
aroused. This discrimination is particularly, found in human beings.

What is needed is, simply to give it due importance and to |
"
392,"Verse 28] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI - 351 -
arouse it. Therefore, a striver should wipe out attachment.

The striver, who does not assume his affinity for modes,
(things) and actions, knows the reality of the modes of nature,
and their actions. He may know the reality, either of the modes .
of nature and their action or the self, the result is the same i.e.,
he knows the reality of the two.

(LHtowt Know This Tru

1. Though the Supreme self dwells in the body, yet it neither
acts nor is tainted (Gita 13/31). Evolutes of nature (body, senses, -
mind, intellect etc.,) are called ‘this’. ""This' cannot be 'T’.When
‘this’ (body etc.,) is not ‘I’, how can actions performed by. this
(body etc.,) be 'mine""? It means, that the body, senses, mind and
intellect etc., are the evolutes of Nature, while the self is totally _
unconnected with them. So how can 'the self be the doer of
actions? He who realizes this fact, is not in bondage. When he
realizes, that he does nothing at all, (Gita 5/8), it means, that he -

_ realizes that he (the self) is different from actions.

2. All the movements, such as seeing, hearing, eating and -
drinking etc., are actions, while food stuff and liquids etc., are
objects. These actions and objects, are known by the sense-
organs (eye, ear, tongue etc.). The sense-organs, are known by
the mind, the mind is known by the intellect, and the intellect
is known by egoism (I'ness). This egoism, is also illumined
by the sentient light, which is the knower, the illuminator and
base, of all of them.

How to know the self (sentient) which is beyond egoism? |

In sound sleep, though intellect merges into ignorance, yet
having awaken from sleep, a man says that he slept soundly. It
means, that he existed even, during a sound sleep. Otherwise,
he would not have known (experienced), that he slept soundly.

Thus, everyone in every state, realizes 'I am’. These are called
enlightened souls who, have renounced their affinity even for
"
393,"352 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
‘I’ (egoism) and have realized the self. Lo .

We have a real affinity for changeless God, while our
affinity for the changing nature, is merely assumed. If we
renounce our affinity for Nature, through discrimination, it is -
known as ‘Jiianayoga' (Discipline of Knowledge). If this affinity
is renounced by performing duty, for the welfare of others, it is
known as 'Karmayoga' (Discipline of Action). When we renounce
our affinity for nature, we realize Yoga, (i.e.,) union with God.
Otherwise, it is merely Jnana (knowledge) and karma (action). -
Those who realize this real affinity for God, having renounced |
the affinity for nature, are, ‘tattvavit' (enlightened souls).

‘Gund gunesu vartanta'—The body, senses, mind and intellect
etc., are also called modes, as these are born of modes of nature,
and all actions are performed by them. Out of ignorance, a man -
by assuming his affinity for these modes, becomes a doer of
actions 1.e., by regarding the actions and objects, as his own and
he becomes a doer. But, when he realizes that the self is different :
and is an illuminator, he cannot think, that he is a doer.

A train, having received power from the engine, runs with the -
help of a driver. The engine supplies power but the train reaches
its destination only when the driver drives it. The engine has no
senses, mind and intellect. Therefore, it needs a driver (man) with |
senses, mind and intellect. But, a man has an engine in the form |
of body and has also senses, mind and intellect to drive it. But
the senses, mind and intellect function having received inspiration
from the source of light. First, light is reflected in the intellect,
from the intellect it goes to the mind, from the mind it goes to
the senses, and then the engine (body) functions. Intellect, mind,
senses and the body—these are modes and their illuminator, is
the self which is not connected with them. Therefore, the modes
are acting on the modes. |

Mostly, the people follow examples set by great men.
Therefore, the Lord declares that as a great man, holds that it
"
394,"Verse 28] SADHAKA-SANJIVANL 353 -
is the modes which are acting on the modes, and does not get |
attached to them, while he works for the welfare of the world;
similarly a striver should also do the same.

There is always an attraction between senses and objects, if
these belong to the same class. Ears have attraction for words,
skin for touch, eyes for form, tongue for taste and nose for
smell. Thus, all the five senses have attraction, for their sense-
objects. Any sense cannot have an attraction, for the object of -
another sense. For example, the eye cannot have attraction, for
melodious words. The self in fact, has no attraction for nature, as
it is not of the same character. It is changeless, eternal, pure and
uniform, while nature is, quite otherwise. But by identifying Itself
with a body, a fragment of nature, it has attraction for nature. -
The attraction of the embodied soul, for the worldly objects, is
really attraction of nature in nature. The senses of doership and ;
enjoyership, are in nature, not in the pure self.

Lord Krsna (in the thirty-first verse of the thirteenth chapter)
declared of the self, ""Though It dwells in the body, yet It neither -
acts not is tainted."" The soul, is said to be the cause, in regard to
the experience of pleasure and pain"" (Gita 13/20), when it (the
soul) resides in nature (Gita 13/21) Le., it identifies Itself, with

' body etc. It means that it is because of Its identification with
nature (body and senses etc.,) that It becomes happy or sad.

Because, prakrti, inert as it is, is incapable of experiencing .
pleasure and pain, and the ‘Self (conscious), alone cannot become
enjoyer, without association with Prakrti. ""

The self is free from the kaleidoscopic, qualities of prakrtt,
but it is certainly capable of assuming a relation with prakrti. It
is not, at all inert like a stone, on the contrary it is Knowledge
incarnate. Had the soul not been competent to assume affinity,
how could it establish relation with prakrti? how could it assume
"
395,"354 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3 ”
the activities of prakrti taking place in it (the soul); how could it
assume doership or enjoyership in it? Assuming or not assuming
relation, 1s a feeling and not an action.

The self, possesses competence to establish a relation _
or otherwise; but on its own it is incompetent to act. Only :
Kaleidoscopic agents can have the capability of taking action.

The Self is by nature, changeless whereas prakrti, changes every
moment. In other words, activeness is innate in prakrti. Therefore, :
by establishing affinity, with prakrti, the ‘Self’ supposes itself to
be the doer (Gita 3/27). ~

It is a merit, rather than a demerit, of the soul that It undergoes
no change. It ever remains the same and is uniform. It cannot
change, in the same way, as ice cannot be hot. But it is free and
so it depends upon it, whether it accepts its affinity for nature -
or not, though really it has no affinity with nature.

When the soul identifies itself with the body, it has attraction -
for nature and then It performs actions and has to reap the fruit
in the form of pleasure and pain. In fact, pleasure and pain have
no separate existence. Therefore, the Lord urges men to renounce ~
their assumed affinity for nature, by considering that it is the
modes, which are acting on the modes, while the (soul or self)
is, quite detached from them.

As a matter of fact, disassociation is already. there and
association is wrongly assumed. Therefore, it is necessary to
give up this assumed relation and to realise the fact, that it is
only modes that are reacting on modes.

‘Iti matva na sajjate'— Here, the term 'matva' has been used /
for ‘knowing’. An enlightened soul, distinguishes the soul from
nature, and so he is not attached to the modes of nature.

By using the term 'matva’, the Lord seems to direct striver,
not to be attached to the modes of nature, by regarding these,
as different from the self. :
"
396,"Verse 28] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 355 -

The methods followed by a Karmayogi, (man of Action)
and a Jnanayogi (man of knowledge) are different. The former,
tries to wipe out his assumed identity with the body etc. In the -
Bhagavata, it is mentioned, ""Persons with desires, deserve to
follow the path of action"" (11/20/7). Lord Krsna in the Gita,
has also laid emphasis on the performance of duty, when He
declares, ""Not by non-performance of action does a man attain
actionlessness"" (Gita 3/4). ""For a sage, who wishes to attain to _
Yoga, action is said to be the means"" (Gita 6/3). A Karmayogi, |
performs action for others, not for himself; therefore, he does :
not become an enjoyer. When he does not become an enjoyer,
his sense of doership, automatically perishes. He becomes doer,
only in order to reap the fruit of action. He does not remain a -
doer, if he does not desire the fruit of action. Therefore, in fact
a Karmayogi also does not become, a doer. | ;

In Sankhyayoga (Discipline of Knowledge) there is
predominance of discrimination. Such a striver holds, ‘It is the -
modes which are acting on the modes’. By thinking so he does
not become a doer of actions. The same fact, has been pointed
out by the Lord (in the twenty-ninth verse of the thirteenth ;
chapter) when He declares, ""He who sees, that all actions are ;
performed by nature alone, and that the self is not the doer, he |
verily sees."" When he does not remain a doer, there does not .
arise any question of his being, an enjoyer.

In this chapter, the Lord has laid great emphasis on the

performance of action; as ""It was by action alone that Janaka |
and others attained perfection"" (3/20); ""I engage Myself in action""
(3/22); ""A wise man also performs actions, for the welfare of
the world without attachment, as an ignorant man acts from
attachment” (3/25-26). It proves that performance of actions, is
good in everyway.
"
397,"356 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3 ”

Appendix—He, who is not deluded by egoism, is an enlightened 7
soul. This enlightened soul has been mentioned ‘tattvadarsi’ (the
seer of truth) in the sixteenth verse of the second chapter. An
enlightened soul transcends the spheres of mode (guna) (objects)
and actions totally. -

So long as a striver has affinity for the world, he can’t be an
enlightened soul. The reason is that a man can’t know the world ,
so long as he is attached to it. The world can be known only .
when he disconnects himself from the world—this is the mule.
Similarly a man cannot know God by assuming himself apart -
from God. He can know Him only by identifying himself with
Him—this is the rule. The reason is that really we are different
from the world and are identical with God. The body is identical
with the world while we (self) are identical with God.

Those who are deluded by the modes of nature, remain attached |
to those modes and actions. Man of perfect knowledge, should not :
unsettle the minds of the ignorant, who know only little. 29
Comment:—

'‘Prakrtergunasammidhah  sajjante gunakarmasu'—The
three modes (goodness, passion and ignorance) of nature, bind ;
a man. The mode of goodness (sattva), binds by attachment
to happiness and knowledge; the mode of passion (rajasa) by
attachment to action, and the mode of ignorance (tamasa) by
heedlessness, indolence and sleep (Gita 14/6—8). In this verse,
is a description of those ignorant people, who are deluded by
the modes of nature i.e., who are bound by them, but who have
"
398,"Verse 29] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 357 -
faith in the scriptures, in prescribed virtuous actions and in the
fruit of those actions. These people have been called ‘the ignorant
people attached to action’ (in the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth
verses). They are attached to actions and objects, in order to
enjoy worldly and heavenly pleasures. Therefore they cannot -
understand the advice as to how to rise, above them. So the
Lord has called them ignorant. |
""Tanakrtsnavido mandan'—Ignorant people, perform virtuous |
actions with the expectation of perishable fruits. They remain
attached to the acquired materials, such as wealth etc., and have -
a desire to acquire the unacquired ones also. It is because of
their attachment and desire, that they do not know reality about
modes (objects) and actions.
Ignorant people know what prescribed actions are, and -
how these should be performed well, but they do not know the
reality, about modes and actions. So, it has been said that they
know only little i.e., they are men of imperfect knowledge and -
they have been called ignorant, because they are interested in
enjoying worldly pleasures and prosperity. -
""Krtsnavinna vicdlayet'—A man of perfect knowledge, who
knows the reality about the sphere of the modes and actions
should not confuse the minds of the ignorant ones, otherwise ;
they would renounce virtuous actions and would have a downfall.
Such a wise man, has been called ‘unattached wise man’ (in the
twenty-fifth verse) and ‘balanced (established in the self) wise
man’ (in the twenty-sixth verse of this chapter).
The Lord (in the twenty-fifth verse) directed a wise man to
act by using the term 'Kuryat' while in the twenty-sixth verse |
He ordered him to engage the ignorant men in action, by the
term ‘Josayet’. But the Lord, by the expression, ‘Na vicalayet',
instead of ordering him, makes a bit of relaxation, by declaring,
that he should not at least unsettle the minds of the ignorant,
with his hints or words or actions. The reason is, that the Lord
"
399,"358 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3 -
does not enforce strict discipline on the liberated souls nor do

the scriptures. Actions are automatically performed, by their,
so-called, bodies for the welfare of the world.*

An enlightened soul, whether he is a Karmayogi or a -
Jiianayogi, has not the least attachment, either to actions or
objects, because he knows the truth that there is no real affinity
between him and actions or objects.

The ignorant, perform virtuous actions in order to gain the
heaven. Therefore, the Lord has ordered the wise men, not to
unsettle the minds of the ignorant people with their hints, words -
or actions, otherwise they would lose their faith and interest in
virtuous actions, and would give these up; which would lead
them to a downfall. Therefore, such people should be dissuaded
from a desire for fruit, rather than from. actions, prescribed by _
the scriptures. Jt is not only proper, but also indispensable, to
dissuade them from desire for the fruit of action, in order to
release them from the bondage of a cycle of birth and death. -

Appendix—Arjuna’s question was why the Lord urged him to
perform such a dreadful deed. The Lord answers his question in -
several ways by which He means to declare, “My aim is not to
engage you in a terrible deed but I want you to renounce your affinity
for actions.” Karmayoga aims at renouncing affinity for actions. :

Link:—The Lord, in the next verse explains, what a striver
should do to be free from attachment, to action and its fruit.

a striver believes that he has to perform obligatory actions, but
these lead him to bondage. In order to clarify his misconception, |
the Lord urges him to surrender all actions to Him, with :
discriminative insight, without having the least affinity for these.
In fact, all actions of the world, are performed by Lord's power. —
The body, senses, mind, objects and power etc., are, the Lord's
and the Lord is his. By thinking so, when a striver performs
actions, those actions instead of leading him to bondage, steer
him to salvation.
Every person, knows that he cannot keep the body, senses,
mind, intellect and material objects etc., under his control,
according to his desire. These belong to nature while the self is, -
a fragment of the Lord (Gita 15/7). So, real surrender consists in
accepting these as of the Lord's, rather than his own. Therefore, -
‘surrender’ means, the renunciation of assumed affinity, for objects
and actions, by attaching importance, to discrimination.
By the expression ‘adhyatmacetasa’, the Lord means to |
say, that one should have a spiritual aim (of God) rather
than a mundane one. The man who has fixed his aim, has a
discriminative insight. In fact, a man's aim or necessity is, to
attain the imperishable, (spiritual) while his desire is to gain
the perishable. A striver should decide upon the aim of his life,
instead of having a desire. |
From either the philosophical or the scientific point of view,
the egoistic notion that he is the doer, his 'Kriya’ becomes a ‘Karma’ which bears
threefold fruit—pleasant, unpleasant and mixed (Gita 18/12). But when he has no
notion of doership, his ‘Kriya’ does not turn into 'Karma' i.e., does not bear fruit,
it is performed just like an impulse (nature) (Gita 3/33).
"
401,"360 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3 7
material objects such as, body etc., cannot be proved to be one's

own. They have been bestowed upon him, so that he may make

its right use. But, when he lays a claim on them, he is bound.
Therefore, when a striver through discrimination, accepts the -
objects and actions as the Lord's, 1t means that he surrenders .
these to Him. |

In the verse, the expression 'Adhyatmacetasa’, has been
used specially. It means. that it is out of ignorance that the
perishable body or world, seems to be one’s own. If discrimination

_ is applied, the perishable body or world, cannot seem as one's :
own, only the Lord will appear as his own. Attachment to the
world, leads to degradation, while detachment leads to progress
(i.e., upliftment).

""The two lettered ‘Mama’ i.e., ‘this is mine’ is death and the _
three lettered 'Na Mama’ i.e., ‘this is not mine’ is immortality""
(Maha. Santi. 13/4), Aévamedhika 51/29).

The Lord urges a man to surrender all actions to Him because, 7
he considers the body, senses, mind, intellect, life-breath, material
and actions, his own and for himself. But in fact, these are neither |
his nor can be his. How can the perishable have affinity for the
imperishable? Therefore, surrender all actions either to the world
or to nature or to God, the result will be the same, as the world
is an evolute of nature and God, is the Lord of nature.Thus,
both the world and nature, belong to God. Therefore, a striver
should think, that he is God's and his so-called possessions, are |
also God's i.e., he should renounce his feeling of mineness to
these. In that case, he has to expect nothing, either from the
world or from God. The Lord Himself looks after his wants
(needs). When a striver, surrenders his body etc., to Him, these
do not seem, to him to be his own. If these appear to him to
be his own, it means that he has not surrendered them, to Him.
"
402,"Verse 30] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 361 -
Therefore, the Lord exhorts a striver to surrender these to Him, |
with a discriminative insight. Thus, when a striver surrenders
these to God, he comes to know the truth, that in fact these are
the Lord's, not his.
The fact of surrender to God, is so unique, that even if we -
surrender out of feeling of surfeit, it brings us immense benefit.
In fact, actions, objects, the body and the self, are not ones' own.
Actions can be surrendered even after their accomplishment.But
real surrender is achieved only when we renounce our affinity
with objects and actions. This abandonment is possible, when
we discern that instruments (body etc.,) objects, actions and the
embodied self, are only God's. A striver commits an error, that
he tries to surrender actions and objects to God, but he does not
surrender his body etc., and the self to Him. Thus his surrender,
remains incomplete. Therefore, a striver should think, that all the ~
objects including his body, senses, mind, intellect and the Self,
belong to God, which are really His.
A mere outward renunciation of actions and objects, ts not
real surrender. Real surrender, consists in regarding the objects
and possessions as His. If a striver surrenders these to God by ;
regarding these as his own, the Lord reciprocates by returning
these manifold, in the same way, as seeds sown, turn into a rich |
harvest. But, still it is in a limited amount. However, when he
surrenders these to Him regarding them as His, He offers Himself
to him, and also feels indebted to him.
The Lord is very much pleased with such a surrender. Even
when it does not help the Lord, in anyway. But its doing so
striver is released from the bondage of actions. When a child
hands over the key lying in a courtyard, to the father, the latter is
very much pleased with the baby and wishes it a long life. Why?
The reason is, that the child has good feelings, when it offers
the key to the father ever though it belongs to him. Similarly,
God is pleased with the striver, who offers all objects, the body
"
403,"362 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
and the self to Him, and is indebted to him.

The Lord has created the human body in a most unusual way, =
and the Lord by His grace has abundantly bestowed upon a human
being, the materials for his existence and spiritual practice including
discrimination. When man, disregarding his discrimination, uses
the things for his selfish motive, and has a desire to acquire more
things, he is enslaved and he has to follow the cycle of birth and
death. Every man knows the reality, that family, circumstances, .
ability, power, body, senses, mind and intellect etc., have been
acquired. These were neither his in the past, nor would remain
his, in the future, because they never remain the same, and are
ever-changing. If, having realized this fact, man ceases to depend _
on these, without attaching importance to them, he can attain
salvation, without any doubt. Attachment to these, is the root
cause of bondage. His attachment to these gives birth to several -
other desires, which lead him to sin, pain, sorrow and hell etc.

All these things, are perishable while the self is imperishable. So -
he should perform his duty by renouncing desires.

Here, a doubt may arise, how would he be inclined to act,
without desire. The clarification is, that a man is inclined to act
for the satisfaction of desires, as well as, to get rid of these. |
Common men perform actions, in order to satisfy their desires,
while strivers act for the purification of their souls, in order to
get rid of desires (Gita 5/11). In fact, actions are performed, in
order to get rid of desires rather than to satisfy them.

The aim of human life is to attain God. When this aim
is achieved, nothing more remains to be acquired. Only those
people, who have forgotten the real aim of human life i.e.,
God-realization, remain inclined to act, in order to satisfy their
desires. The Lord has called such people wretched or pitiful, as
they seek the fruits (of their actions) (Gita 2/49). On the other
"
404,"Verse 30] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 363 _
hand, those strivers, who perform actions by renouncing their
fruits, in order to be free from desires, have been called wise

(Gita 2/51).

The feelings of rendering selfless service, Self-realization and
God-realization, are aims, rather than desires, while the feeling ~
to acquire perishable objects, is desire.Therefore, it is wrong to
think, that a man is not inclined to act without desire. Actions
are performed scrupulously, in order to attain one’s aim.

Man (soul), is a fragment of God but his disinclination for
God and inclination towards the world, gives birth to necessity, as _
well as, desires.When he totally renounces his assumed affinity for |
the world, his necessity is fulfilled, and he gets rid of desires.

'Nirasirnirmamo bhiitva yudhyasva vigatajvarah'—When all
actions and objects are surrendered to God, even then a fragment
of desire as the sense of mine and grief, can remain. For example, -
if we offer a book to someone, and we see him studying that
book, we think that he is studying the book, given by us. In ;
order to free us from this minor attachment, the Lord urges us
not to have a desire to acquire anything, nor to be attached to
the acquired things and not to be grieved for the things lost. 7

- The criterion for surrender is, that a striver has no fragment of
desire, no feeling of mine and no grief. |

When a striver surrenders all actions and objects to God, :

sometimes because of past impressions (influences), he feels that
he has not got rid of desire, the sense of mineness and grief.
Such a striver need not lose heart, because only he who perceives
desire, the sense of mineness and grief, becomes free of them.
Similar, is the case with egoism. Every human being fully deserves
to get rid of desire, and a sense of mine and grief.

In the whole Gita the term 'Jvara’ (mental fever viz., grief)
has only been used here. In a war, a warrior is grieved at the
death of his kith and kin. Therefore, Lord Krsna directs Arjuna
to fight, delivered from grief, as his duty as a member of the
"
405,"364 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3  ~
warrior class. The Lord, means to say that a striver should |
perform his duty by surrendering it to God, and being free from
desire, a sense of mineness and grief. Remaining equanimous
in success and failure, pleasure and pain, a sense of mineness
and aversion etc., is known as a state of ‘Vigatajvarah' ~
(freedom from grief). In fact, all the mental defects, such as a
sense of mineness, aversion, worry, agitation and turmoil etc.,
are included in, 'Jvara’. -
When a striver has God-realization as the only goal of his life,
all his possessions and things, whether superior or inferior, are
surrendered tc God. Having surrendered his actions and objects,
he surrenders his desire, the sense of mineness and grief, which
appear in him, to God. Thus, he becomes a staunch devotee with -
exclusive devotion.
For a sage who wishes to attain Yoga, action is said to be the -
means (Gita 6/3), because, while performing action he comes to
know his defects, (desire, the sense of mineness etc.).* Therefore, -
(in the twelfth verse of the twelfth chapter) the renunciation of the
fruit of action, has been considered to be better than meditation.
The reason is, that in meditation a striver pays attention so that |
the mind is not volatile. When his mind is fixed, he regards it,
as his success and does not pay heed to other defects, such as
desire and sense of mineness etc. Therefore, the Lord in this
verse orders Arjuna to perform his duty of fighting, so that he
may come to know his defects also.
As the Lord (in the forty-eighth verse of the second chapter)
instructs Arjuna to perform his duty while being equanimous
in success and failure, here, He asks him to fight being free
* A volunteer offers his service being a member ofa voluntary committee. But
when he is honoured or praised, he relishes it i.e., derives pleasures out of it. This
is wrong. Thus such defects become known only. when actions are performed.
"
406,"Verse 30] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 365 -
from desire, the sense of mineness and grief. When even
such a savage deed as fighting, can be performed with
equanimity, what other action is there which cannot be
performed with equanimity? Equanimity can be attained by /
believing, ""I am neither my body, nor the body is mine nor is
it for me,"" which is also, a fact.
It is possible to do an act worth doing, only when a striver's
aim is focussed on God, and not on the world. As the striver .
advances gradually, on the path of God-realization, his vices,
like desire, myness and attachment etc., diminish automatically ~
and he experiences his Self to be positioned in equanimity. As
soon as the practice of equanimity gets perfect, the doership is
vanished completely and identification with the aim is established.
As a rule, the ego perishes when there remains no desire to do -
anything, for one’s own good gain. |
Arjuna wants to attain salvation, without performing his
duty, of fighting. When Arjuna asks for a way to salvation, -
the Lord orders him to fight, as it is his duty. According to the
Lord, salvation can be attained, through the path of action or .
knowledge or devotion.
Appendix—By now the Lord answered Arjuna’s question
(why do you urge me to perform such a dreadful deed?) in )
several ways. Now in this verse the Lord tells him the method
to perform actions through the path of devotion to God.
‘Surrender all actions to Me’—By this expression the Lord
means to say, “Without regarding actions and objects as yours
and for you, regard them as Mine and for Me.” The reason is that |
God is entire (complete) and all actions and objects (Adhibhita)
(matter) are within the entire form of the Lord (Gita 7/29-30).
Here the term ‘mayi’ (Me) has been used for the entire form
of the Lord.
In this verse by the expression, ‘mayi sarvani karmani
sannyasya’ Bhaktiyoga (the path of devotion); by the expression, :
"
407,"366 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 ~~
‘adhyatmacetasa’ Jnanayoga (the path of knowledge); and by |
the expression, ‘nirasimirmamo bhutva yudhyasva vigatajvarah’
Karmayoga (the path of action) have been mentioned.
Link:—Having outlined His teaching (principle) in the
preceding verse, in the next two verses, the Lord substantiates,
the same.

Sraddhavanto'nasityanto mucyante te'pi karmabhih
Persons who always follow this teaching of Mine, with faith _
and without question, are released from the bondage of all actions
(Karma). 31
Comment:— : -
""Ye me matamidam nityamanutisthanti manavah Sraddhavan-
to'nasiiyanto'—A person belonging to any caste, creed, sect and 7
order of life etc., who wants to be released from the bondage
of actions, should practise this teaching. By realizing the fact,
that the body, senses, mind, intellect, objects and actions |
etc., are not one's own, men are released from this bondage.
‘Sraddhavantah’, is he who has a firm faith in and devotion for
the Lord and His teaching.
A man is released from bondage, when he regards the material
objects, such as body etc., neither as his nor for him. Having
faith in this truth, it becomes easy to renounce the assumed |
affinity for the insentient.
A striver having faith, only listens to the divine discourses
and translates these into practice. This human body has been
bestowed upon us, so that we may realize God. So we should
try to arouse a yearning to realize Him. When this yearning is
"
408,"Verse 31] - SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 367
/
aroused, other virtues such as faith, promptness and self-control
» etc., are naturally inculcated in our mind. :
The Lord has laid emphasis on faith and also freedom
from petty objections, because even a man of faith can have a -
carping nature, to some extent. So the Lord urges strivers to be |
totally free from cavil. The Lord also lays emphasis on this very
fact, while glorifying the study of the Gita when He declares,
""A man who hears this gospel with faith and uncritically is
liberated (Gita 18/71). -
When a man holds that the teaching of the Lord is good, but
it reveals His boastful and egoistic nature; or how could actions
lead to salvation, when these are conducive to bondage—such
opinions show a man’s critical spirit. So, a striver should be free
from this sort of attitude. 7
In fact, all objects belong to the Lord, but by an error, a man |
regards these as his own and so he is enslaved. It is because of -
his attachment and desire, that he has to suffer. Therefore, the
Lord, out of His grace and affection, urges him to surrender all ;
actions and things to Him, so that he may attain eternal bliss,
though He lacks nothing, and is perfect.
The Lord's teaching is called, an universal doctrine. Here the |
Lord's teaching or discipline has been described by the term 'Matam’.
The Lord, out of His natural simplicity and absence of vanity,
has called the universal principle, as mere ‘Mata.’ His teachings
ever remain the same, without undergoing any modifications.
It depends, upon a man whether he has faith in it or not.
Here, the adjective 'nityam’ (constant) does not qualify 'Matam' |
(teaching) but it modifies ‘anutisthanti’ (practise) (follow), because
the Lord is eternal (constant) and so all objects pertaining to
Him, are also eternal. His teaching is also eternal. So the Lord
emphasizes that it should be practised constantly.
Question:—What is the doctrine of the Lord, and how should
it be practised (followed)? oo
"
409,"368 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3
Answer:—All acquired things are not ours—this is the
considered view of the Lord. Whatever materials—body, senses,
mind, intellect, life-breath, riches, property, objects etc., there are,
these are the evolutes of nature and the world is also an evolute -
of nature. So, all of these have identity with the world; while the
self, being a fragment of God, has its identification with Him.
Therefore, all of these are not our personal possessions, but have —_
been bestowed upon us, so that we may utilize them properly.
Besides, these, the virtues such as good conduct, renunciation,
dispassion, kindness and forgiveness etc., are, also not personal; -
being divine traits they also belong to God. Had these been ours
these would have also remained with us and no one could have
acquired them, without our permission. But it is not so. When
“we accept these as ours, we are proud of these and pride isa = _
root of demoniac endowment. | |

When we regard a thing, which really is not ours, as ours,
it captures us. Materialistic things, such as body etc., are neither ~
ours nor for us. Had they been ours, they might have provided us
full satisfaction, when we acquired them. But these never satisfy -
us, and add fuel to desires. But if we realize God, we are fully
satisfied, and we attain perfection and nothing further remains to
be gained (acquired). As, a lost child is not pleased and satisfied |
with any other woman (though she is also a mother), except his —
own mother, similarly, we are not satisfied with any other state
except God-realization. Therefore, so long as we have the desire
to acquire something, it, means that we have not acquired our
very own object viz:, God.

We neither brought the worldly things with us, nor can we
carry these with us and at present also, these are deserting us,
constantly. While presently these are under our possession. It
behaves that, we use these for the welfare of the world, rather
than lay claim to them. The Lord is so generous and gracious,
that He bestows these upon us in, such a way, that they appear
to us to be ours. If we use them for our selfish motive, it means ee
"
410,"Verse 31] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 369
that we misuse His generosity and grace. Therefore, a striver in
order to rectify his error, should surrender these to Him, with a
discriminative insight.

If a striver whose only aim is God-realization, gives a serious -
thought to the topic, he will come to know the truth, that all |
the acquired things such as, the body, rank, right, education,
knowledge, riches and property etc., belong to the world, and so 7
they should be utilized, for the world. We may call them either
of the world or of nature, or of God, but these are not ours. So
how can they be for us. -

A striver has, neither to regard a thing as his, nor has to
perform any action for him. The actions, which are performed
by him for himself, bind him because the Lord declares, ""One
is bound by actions, other than those performed, for the sake of —
sacrifice (Yajiia)"" (Gita 3/9), ""Actions including the stored ones |
of the person who performs them for the sake of sacrifice are
dissolved entirely""(Gita 4/23). -
God is the almighty Lord of all the worlds (Gita 5/29).
When, a man regards himself as the lord of his objects and 7
possessions, he forgets the real Lord, and thinks of those objects
and possessions. Therefore, a striver should live like a servant
to the Lord, Who is the only master of the entire universe. By
becoming an instrument in His hands, he should perform his duty,
with the body, senses, mind, intellect and material bestowed upon
him by Him, without having any pride of ownership.
Having surrendered everything and action to God, he should
not be swayed, by the pairs of opposites, such as profit and |
loss, honour and dishonour, pleasure and pain etc., because these
are the gifts of God and so they are His. Performance of duty,
joyfully, under the available circumstance means, the practice
of His teaching.
""Mucyante te'pi karmabhih'—The Lord, seems to say to
Arjuna, that He was ordering him in clear terms to surrender
"
411,"370 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
actions to Him. By obeying Him, he will undoubtedly be released
from bondage. Moreover, if other people also, whom He has not
ordered this way practise His teaching, they will also be released
from bondage even though they may not believe in Him. .

Appendix—The Lord’s opinion is the real and foremost |
principle, within which all views and doctrines are included.
The Lord without pride with a simple and polite heart, calls His
principle (Siddhanta) as opinion (Mata). It means that the Lord __
has not insisted upon his opinion or the opinion of anyone else
but he has put forth his view being impartial. - |

An opinion is not universal but it is personal. Everyone can
express his opinion but a principle is the basic and supreme truth
of universal character which everyone has to follow. Therefore
there can be difference of opinion between the teacher and the -— ~~ |
pupil but there can’t be difference in principle. Sages, hermits
and philosophers name their opinion as ‘principle’ but in the
Gita the Lord names His principle as ‘Mata’ (opinion). There are >
differences in the opinions of sages, hermits, philosophers and
teachers etc., but the Lord’s opinion viz., principle is universally -
accepted without any difference of opinion.

Comment:—

'Ye tvetadabhyasityanto nanutisthanti me matam'—Having
shown the advantage of practising His teaching (in the thirty-first
"
412,"Verse 32] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 371
verse) here the term ‘tu’ (but) has been used, to distinguish those
who do not follow His teaching, from those who do follow.
Some people hold that as worldly, selfish people, want to
acquire worldly objects and also want to get profit themselves, -
similarly, the Lord wants all actions to be surrendered to Him
and also that He should be regarded, as the Lord. Those who
think so, find fault with His teaching. -
Similarly, ‘those who think that in worldly affairs, desire is
a must, and it is impossible to renounce attachment, aversion
and a feeling of mine, also slight His teaching. -
Those people who hanker after worldly pleasures and
prosperity and regard the body, objects and actions etc., as
theirs, and for them, do not follow His teaching.
‘Sarvajfianavimiidhan tan'—Those who do not follow the -
Lord's teaching are under delusion regarding worldly knowledge
(sciences, arts etc.). They remain engrossed, in inventions and
scientific discoveries, like motor cars, aeroplanes, radios, :
televisions etc. Similarly, they remain engaged in knowing about
painting, architecture, arts, crafts, mystical formulas, incantations, -
implements, different scripts and languages, custom traditions
and other developments. They are fully convinced, that there is
nothing beyond these things (Gita 16/11). Such people, are said :
to be under delusion regarding knowledge.
'Acetasah'—They are devoid of discrimination, because
they cannot distinguish the real from the unreal, righteous from
unrighteous, salvation from bondage and so on. They remain
ignorant, like animals. ""Of vain hopes, of vain actions, of vain
knowledge and senseless, they verily are"" (Gita 9/12).
""Viddhi nastan'—Know those human beings who do not follow
the Lord's teaching, to be doomed to destruction. It means, that
they will be subjected to the cycle of birth and death.
A man can attain salvation, upto the time of death
(Gita 8/5). Therefore, those people, who do not follow the Lord's :
"
413,"372 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
teaching in this life at present can follow it, at sometime in
future because of good company etc., and can attain salvation.
But if they do not follow His teachings even upto death, they
should be known to be doomed, to destniction, because they are
deprived of God-realization. | -

He, who does not follow the Lord's teaching, performs actions
out of attachment and aversion, which are his foes (Gita 3/34).
Transient objects and actions perish, but a man while performing __
actions, comes under the sway of attachment and aversion, which
lead him to lower births and hells. Therefore, the Lord declares, ~
that such a man will be doomed to destruction.

In the thirty-first verse, the Lord declares that those who
follow His teachings are released from the bondage of actions,
while in this verse He declares, that those who do not, follow oo
His teaching, are to be doomed to destruction. It means, that the
Lord urges upon people to follow His teachings, even if they do :
not believe in Him. If they do not follow His teaching, they will ._~
be doomed to. But if a striver, believing in Him, follows His
teaching, He offers Himself to him. If he, without believing in _
Him, follows His teaching, He leads him to salvation. It means,
that he who believes in Him, attains His love while he who
follows His teaching, attains salvation. |

beings follow their own nature. What them can restraint do? 33
Comment:—
'‘Prakrtim yanti bhitani'—All actions are performed, either
according to one's own nature or according to the Lord's principles, 8
(scriptural injunctions). One's nature can be of two kinds, either
free from attachment and aversion, or having attachment and
aversion. If a man, on his way, happens to see a notice board. |
His casting a glance at it, is, neither because of attachment nor
aversion, nor from an angle of principle. It happens through his
pure personal nature. We read a letter received from a friend, -
with some feeling of attachment, while that of an enemy with
aversion. We study sacred texts such as the Gita and the Ramayana,
according to the Lord's principle. The only aim of human life is
God-realization. Therefore, actions which are performed, with the _
aim of God-realization, are performed, according to His principles
i.e., according to the scriptural injunctions.
All actions, such as seeing, hearing, smelling, touching So
etc., are performed according to one’s nature and according to
His principle. Nature, free from attachment and aversion, is not -
faulty, while nature with attachment and aversion is. Actions,
which are performed out of attachment and aversion, bind a
man because they make his nature impure. On the other hand,
actions which are performed according to God's principles, lead
to salvation, because these purify one's nature. It is, because of
impure personal nature, that the assumed affinity for the world,
is not renounced. As soon as_ his nature is purified, the assumed
affinity is easily, renounced. |
Actions, are automatically performed, by the so-called body of
a wise man, because he has no sense of doership. All actions of a
striver, whose aim is God-realization, are performed, according to
the scriptural injunctions. As a greedy, person is always careful,
that he should not sustain any loss, a striver is always careful
lest he should perform an activity with attachment or aversion.
"
415,"374 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
By being careful, a striver's nature is purified and consequently,
he is liberated from the bondage of his actions.

Although, all actions are performed by modes of nature,
yet an ignorant man, whose mind is deluded by egoism, thinks -
that he is the doer (Gita 3/27). Affinity for objects and actions,
gives birth to attachment and aversion, which lead him on to the
cycle of birth and death. But, he who has no affinity for nature _
(prakrti), sees that the self is not the doer (Gita 13/29).

It is attachment for material objects, which influences a |
person to perform,.evil actions. For a striver, attachment is the
main cause of bondage. Attachment dwells in assumed egoism,
and appears in mind, intellect, senses and sense-objects.

2—The cosmic ego, a mode of nature—'Mahabhitanya-
hankarah' (Gita 13/5). The latter form egoism, is flawless, as it
is an instrument, like the mind, intellect and senses etc., while ~
the former kind, is defective. A wise man, does not identify the
self with the body, and so all his actions are performed by the
modes of nature ie., by the latter kind. But an ignorant man, ~
who regards the body, as 'T and ‘mine’, and all actions as his

- and for him, is, because the assumption of actions as his, and
for him, causes attachment.*

'SadrSarh cestate svasyah prakrterjiianavanapi'—A perfect soul,
being free from attachment and aversion, acts in accordance with
pure nature. He is not swayed by nature. As a learned man, speaks
a language which he knows, similarly, the Lord also, behaves in

* As the body automatically develops and changes, similarly all the actions
are naturally performed. But a common man remains engrossed in (practical)
actions because of attachment and aversion while a wise man being free from
attachment and aversion does not get engrossedinthem. | ,

accordance with His incarnation, as Rama or Krsna or a fish, a
tortoise or a hog etc., but does not remain completely under sway |
of nature (prakrti). Similarly, those enlightened souls who have |
renounced their affinity for matter (prakrti) may vary in their
nature, but are not swayed by it. So, their actions are nothing | -
more than gestures of action, while common men, who have not :
renounced their affinity for matter, act according to individual
natures (natural propensities) and remain completely under its sway.
Here the term ‘Svasyah’ implies, that the nature of a wise |
man is flawless, and so he is not under the sway of nature, he -
rather controls nature. Actions, bear fruits only when a man
performs these, with a sense of ‘doership' and selfishness. A
wise man, remains free from the vanity of doership and also
from selfishness. So actions performed by him, are pure and
even ideal, for other strivers. 7
Impression of the past, and the present births, influence ,
of parents, society, company, education, environment, study, -
adoration, thoughts, actions and feelings, make up a man's
nature. The nature, varies from person to person and everyone -
is free to make it pure. The nature of one enlightened soul, varies
from that of the other, but it is pure (free from attachment and
aversion). So they are not swayed by nature. On the other hand, .
the ignorant (having attachment and aversion) have to perform
actions by force according to their own evil nature, which they
themselves have acquired.
""'Nigrahah kith karisyati'—The wise men perform virtuous
actions enjoined by the scriptures according to their pure nature,
while the ignorant perform evil actions under the sway of their
bad nature.
When Arjuna wanted to abstain from fighting, the Lord says
to him, ""Thy nature will compel thee"" (Gita 18/59), ""Thou shalt
do even against thy will, fettered by thine, own acts, born of
thy nature"" (18/60).
"

As, a.-motor car cannot cross the limit of 100 miles per hour ©
in its speed, a wise man cannot act, against his pure nature. One
with an impure nature is like a damaged car. A damaged car
can be repaired in two ways— (i) by the driver himself, (ii) by
sending it to a workshop. Similarly, the impure nature can be ~—
purified in two ways— (i) through the performance of actions,
without attachment and aversion (Gita 3/34), (ii) through perfect
surrender to the Lord (Gita 18/62). If a motor car functions -
smoothly, it means that we are not under its control, but if it
breaks down it means, that we are affected by it. Similarly, a _
wise man, because of his pure nature, is not under the sway of
nature, while an ignorant man because of his impure nature, has
to act under the influence of nature.

A man, who attaches importance to worldly pleasures and
prosperity, is sure to have a downfall, even though he may be
learned. On the other hand, he who does not attach importance
to the insentient (matter) (prosperity and pleasure) and whose aim __
is God-realization, is surely, to have upliftment, even though he
is not learned. The reason is, that feelings, thoughts and actions
of a man, whose aim instead of enjoying worldly pleasures _
and prosperity, is God-realization, are conducive to his uplift
(salvation). Therefore, a striver, first of all should decide upon
the goal of his life—God-realization. Then, in order to attain that
aim, he should perform his duty, being free from attachment and
aversion. An easy method, of being. free from attachment and
aversion, is that we render service to others, with our acquired
materials such as body etc., without regarding these as ours and
for us, and without expectation of any reward. |

If a striver does not want to come under the influence of
nature, he should perform his duty, by fixing an ideal for himself.
The ideal (model) can be of two kinds— (i) The Lord's teaching

' (i1) Wise men's actions. By following, the Lord's teaching or
wise men's actions, a striver's nature is purified and he realizes
"
418,"Verse 33] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 377

God, Who is ever attainable. On the other hand, the man, who

without following the Lord's teaching or the wise men's actions,

performs actions out of attachment and aversion, is doomed to

destruction (Gita 3/32). -
As we cannot forcibly obstruct the course of a river, but

can turn it to another direction, similarly, we can tum the

flow of our actions, towards the welfare of others. When we -

perform acts for the welfare of others, then the direction is

towards the world, and we, the strivers, are liberated from the

bondage of actions. ee
Appendix—Even a wise man acts according to his nature. :

No one can act without being guided by the circumstantial

causes. As a teacher teaches a pupil alphabet (a, b, c) in

conformity with the standard of his pupil, similarly a wise man —

acts and behaves with a common man by putting himself in the

latter’s situation.
‘Cestate’—This term means that he does not perform actions -

but activities are naturally performed by him according to his

nature. The shaking of the leaves of a tree is not an action (sin -

or virtue) bearing fruit. Even so a man free from the sense of

doership has no incentive to perpetrate sinful or virtuous acts,

he can never commit a sin or virtue. |
The wise men remain engrossed in the welfare of others

because their nature as strivers has been to do good to

others—‘sarvabhutahite ratah’ (Gita 5/25, 12/4). Therefore

though nothing remains to be done, to be known and to be

attained by them, yet their nature is to do activities beneficent

to all. It means that when by remaining engrossed in the welfare

of others, their affinity for the world is totally renounced, they

have not to work for the welfare of others but because of the

natural inclination of the past, good is naturally done by them

as a matter of habit. |

Attachment and aversion of man abide in each and _
every sense-object through the feeling of agreeableness' or
disagreeableness towards its senses. Let no one come under
their sway, for they are his waylayers and foes. 34
Comment:— |
7 ""Indriyasyendriyasyarthe ragadvesau vyavasthitau'—Each sense ~-
has attraction for a pleasant aspect (ear, eye, skin, tongue and
nose for sound, sight, touch, taste and smell respectively), and
aversion for an unpleasant one. Oo
, In fact, attachment and aversion do not abide, in the
- sense-objects. If they had abode in the sense-objects, the same —
objects might have been pleasant (desirable) or unpleasant
(undesirable ) equally, to everyone. But it does not happen. Rain
is desirable for a farmer, but not so for a potter. Moreover, —
the same object is sometimes pleasant, while it is unpleasant at
other time, to the same person. Cool air, is pleasant in summer
| but unpleasant in winter. Thus, we have attraction and aversion —
by regarding these as desirable and undesirable. Therefore, the
Lord has declared, that attachment and aversion of man abide
in the sense-objects.
In fact, attachment and aversion abide in assumed ‘ego'
(Tness).* The assumed affinity for the body is called ‘ego’. So
_ * Theterm ‘Asya’ in the expression ‘Rasavarjam raso'pyasya (Gita 2/59) used
by Lord Krsna also denotes that attachment and aversion abide in the assumed
‘ego’ (in a striver).
"
420,"Verse 34] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 379 -
long as, there is assumed affinity for the body, attachment and
aversion, exist in ‘ego’ and appear to be abiding in the intellect,
mind, senses and objects of senses. These attachment and aversion
in their gross forms have been called ‘desire’ and ‘anger’ (from _
the thirty-seventh to the forty-third verses of this chapter). In -
the fortieth verse, it has been said, that this desire exists in the |
senses, the mind and the intellect, because it appears to abide in
them. As attachment and aversion appear to subsist in the sense- a
objects, similarly attachment and aversion appear to inhabit in
senses, mind and intellect. In fact, the senses, the mind and the —
intellect are merely instruments. So, there is no question of the
desire and anger or attachment and aversion existing in them. |
Besides this, the Lord declares in the fifty-ninth verse of the
second chapter, ""The objects of the senses turn away, from the
man who abstains from feeding on them but the taste for them a
remains. Even the taste turns away when the Supreme is seen.""

'Tayorna vasamagacchet'—The Lord assures strivers, that they -
should never be disappointed, in the means and ends, if attachment
and aversion appear. The scriptures, rather than attachment and -
aversion, should be the authority for determining what should be
done and what should not be done (Gita 16/24). If a striver acts or |
abstains from action, with attachment and aversion, 1t means that
he is affected by attachment and aversion. If a person performs
actions, or abstains from actions with attachment and aversion, :
attachment and aversion, are strengthened. This strengthening,
leads a man to a downfall.

When a striver starts worship, renouncing the worldly affairs,
good and bad thoughts of the world come to his mind, and he
gets perturbed. The Lord urges him not to be perturbed, because .
these are perishable, and appear and disappear. In fact, thoughts
have no existence of their own, because as a rule what is born
must die. In fact, these thoughts do not come to mind, these
rather, slip away from the mind. Thoughts remain suppressed,
"
421,"380 _ SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 -
when a man is busy with worldly affairs, but when he stops _
his work, the suppressed thoughts, have an outlet. Therefore, a
striver, without having attachment or aversion, should remain
indifferent to these. Similarly, he should have neither attachment
nor aversion, for persons and things etc. -
When actions are performed, out of attachment and aversion, -
attachment and aversion are strengthened and these are transformed
into impure nature. This impure nature, brings a man under its _
sway. Then the actions performed by him, bind him. So, during
the performance or non-performance of actions, a striver should
not come under their influence. This is the means, to obliterate
attachment and aversion, which is explained here. Previous to
this, the Lord also declared, another means. The Lord said, ""Those -
who constantly follow this teaching of Mine, are released from
bondage of actions” (Gita 3/31). So a striver should follow His
teachings, so that he may get rid of attachment and aversion. ~
When a striver surrenders, his actions, body, senses, mind,
intellect and himself to God, and performs his duty free from -
desire, egoism and grief, his attachment and aversion perish. So
a person should follow His teachings, while he performs actions
or abstains himself from actions. -
The entire universe is an evolute of nature and a body is
| a fragment of the universe. So long as a man is attached to a
body, he comes under the sway of attachment and aversion, while
acquiring and abandoning things etc. When actions are performed
or abandoned with attachment and aversion, the performance or
non-performance of those strengthen attachment and aversion.
But if these are either performed or abandoned according to the
scriptural injunctions, attachment and aversion perish. If a person
does not know the ordinance of the scriptures, he should keep
in mind, the great sage Vedavyasa's teaching—""O men, listen to
the gist of righteousness and follow it. The gist is—We should
"
422,"Verse 34] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 381 -
not do to others, what we do not wish to be done to us (Padma |
Purana, Srsti. 19/355-56).
Liberated souls always follow the scriptural injunctions.
That is why Bhisma Pitamaha, offered food and water to the
manes on kuSa grass, though his father's hand was clearly visible -
to him (Mahabharata, AnuSasana. 84/15—20). Therefore, a
striver should perform, all actions according to the ordinance
of the scriptures. _
For a striver who wants to get rid of attachment and aversion,
the scripture is the authority for determining what should be done. _
The heart of an enlightened soul, totally free from attachment
and aversion, is so pure, that his thoughts, feelings and actions
are nothing but, the ordinances of scriptures,* even 1f he may be
illiterate. Thus his words and actions are exemplary (Gita 3/21)
and by following such teaching and actions, strivers get rid of ~
attachment and aversion. |
Some people believe that attachment and aversion, are natural -
tendencies (natural inclinations of the mind) which cannot be
wiped out, but it is wrong, as these appear and disappear. When
a striver practises spiritual discipline, they become bearer—it is :
every striver's experience; and whatever grows scarce, may perish
altogether. The Lord has declared, that these come to mind (Gita
2/55) but do not stay there permanently. Moreover, He has called :
these as modifications, (Gita 13/6) which have a beginning and
an end, rather than 'Dharmas'. Evenness of mind, 1n the desirable
and the undesirable, has been called spiritual discipline (Gita
13/9). Had attachment and aversion, been permanent features of
the mind, it could not have attained, the state of evenness. This :
means that they come to the mind and can be wiped out.
* The heart of the person who never renounces righteousness also becomes
pure. Great poet Kalidasa while describing king Dusyanta declares—""Where
there is doubt, there the inclination of the heart of a virtuous person is the
testimony"" (Abhijfianagakuntalam 1/21).
"
423,"382 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 3 -
A man, through discrimination, knows that nature (matter) .
prakrti and Soul (spirit) are different from each other. But, the
soul identifies itself with the body (born of nature), and this
identification is called 'ego' (1) in which attachment and aversion
exist, and both these strengthen egoism. These—(attachment and -
aversion) seem to abide in the intellect, because of which one's
own beliefs appear pleasant, while the beliefs of others unpleasant.
These seem to abide in the mind, and what one thinks as desirable, -
while what others think, is undesirable. These seem to also in
senses, due to which favourable objects seem pleasant, while _
unfavourable ones appear unpleasant. These may also appear,
in the objects of senses (sound, touch, sight, taste, smell), as
favourable and unfavourable. When egoism (identification of
the self with the body) is rooted out, attachment and aversion,
totally perish, because egoism is their base. -
‘Tam a servant’, 'I am an inquisitive learner’, 'I am a devotee'
etc., this is how one may feel. These me—a ‘servant’, ‘learner’ and -
‘devotee’, reside in the same 'T' in which attachment and aversion,
co-exist. Attachment and aversion, abide neither exclusively in
inert nor in conscious state. These live, only in assumed, relation :
between the inert and conscious, yet these live mainly, in the
inert. In the state of identification of soul with the matter, the
material part is attracted towards matter alone, but it appears also |
in the conscious soul, due to this identification. Attraction for the
insentient (matter) is attachment. When a striver identifies the
self with the body, he feels difficulty, in renouncing attachment
and aversion. But when he has an eye on the Self, he has no
difficulty in renouncing attachment and aversion, because these
have no existence of their own. These are bom, only when one
identifies the self with the body etc.
If a striver has attachment for good company, adoration and
meditation etc., he has aversion for the world. But if he has ‘love’
(devotion) for God, he will have no aversion for the world, but
"
424,"Verse 34] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 383 -
he will be indifferent to the world.* | /

If a man has attachment for one object, he has aversion for
an other, but when he has love (devotion) for God, he develops
dispassion. Dispassion, leads to selfless service by. wiping out
desire for pleasure. Then the body, senses, mind, intellect and .
ego, are automatically engaged in the service of the world.
Consequently, attachment and aversion, which abide in ego,
totally perish when affinity to the self for the body etc., along -
with ego, is renounced. |

All actions of a person, are performed according to his -
nature or according to scriptural injunctions. If something
is done, with a view to spiritual progress only, it is done in
obedience to the above rule. Nature, can be pure (free from
attachment and aversion) and impure (with attachment and
aversion). It cannot be totally renounced, but it can be purified SO
1.e., made free from attachment and aversion. As the course of
the Ganges cannot be forcibly obstructed, but its direction can /
be changed, similarly, action cannot be totally renounced, but
their flow (course) can be changed i.e., can be made free from
attachment and aversion. This is a vital teaching of the Gita. -
It is, neither the performance nor non-performance of actions,
but attachment and aversion, which are the stumbling blocks to
a striver's spiritual progress. So, the Lord declares, that a wise :
man, is he who has neither attachment for agreeable actions nor
aversion for disagreeable ones (Gita 18/10). Generally, strivers

* Whether a striver has attachment or love (devotion) to holy company can be |
illustrated by the following example:—If anybody creates an obstacle to a striver's
good company, adoration or meditation and he gets angry with him, it means that |
he has attachment. But if he feels sad, it means that he has love. The reason is that
there are obstacles to the spiritual discipline when his determination 1s not firm.
So he is sad because of his shortcoming. Similarly, if he is biased against any
religion or sect, it means that he is attached to his own religion or sect.

In fact even attachment to the good company, adoration and meditation
is not bad because this spiritual practice leads the mind to the thought of God
(Srimadbhi. 7/1/31).
"
425,"384 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 ~
are not on their guard against attachment and aversion. Their |
activities come under the sway of these. Therefore, a striver
should perform actions, according to scriptural ordinances in
order to be free from attachment and aversion. By doing so his
nature will automatically, be improved. 7
When desire mixed with attraction or aversion, 1s born,
and we act according to its dictates, attraction and aversion, get
strengthened and if we act according to the principles enunciated °
these get wiped out.
When good and evil thoughts come to the mind of a striver, ~
he should neither have attachment nor aversion for these, he
should neither support nor oppose these. He should remain
indifferent by thinking that he (the self) is different and so the
self has no affinity, for these. -
If a striver finds himself helpless, in renouncing attachment
and aversion, he should take refuge in the omnipotent Lord, Who
is his most disinterested friend. By His grace, he overcomes -
attachment and aversion (Gita 7/14) and attains supreme peace (Gita
18/62). The assumption is that the body, senses, mind, intellect, 7
ego and all the worldly objects belong to the Lord, take refuge
in Him. So, a striver should serve Him, in order to please Him
offer the materials provided by Him,without expecting any reward.
Expectation of a reward leads to affinity for the insentient (matter).
‘Service to others, without expecting any reward’, 1s the
means to wipe out attachment and aversion. All our possessions,
including the physical, subtle and causal bodies, as well as
ego, are to render service to the world, because these are
essentially the same, as is the world. An assumption, that
these are different from the world, leads to bondage. A striver,
should not derive pleasure out of things and actions, with a
physical body, out of thinking, with the subtle body and out of
trance with the causal body. In fact, this human body is not for
pleasures (Manasa 7/44/1).
"
426,"Verse 34] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 385 -
— Secondly, the body, senses, mind, intellect and objects etc.,

with which service is rendered, are fragments of the world. How
can fragments of the world be ours when the world is not ours?
We cannot render service to others with these in a disinterested
way, if we regard these as ours. Therefore, we should regard -
these as, of those whose service 1s rendered with these. A devotee ,
surrenders these to God, by regarding these as His. Similarly,
a Karmayog! surrenders these to the world, by regarding these -
as the world's.

He alone can render true service to others, who never requires
anything for himself. The desire for money in lieu of service, is
no doubt a desire, but an inclination to serve, is also a desire, -
because it results in a desire for riches. A striver, should not have
a desire to acquire money, even for rendering service, to others.
If he gets an opportunity, he should render service according to -
his resources, but he should have no desire to render service. He
who derives pleasure by rendering service to others, or has the -
sentiment that people are benefited by him, or expects honour
and praise, or gets pleased by receiving honour and praise, in
reality enjoys pleasures, instead of rendering true service. If a
striver derives pleasure out of this, it gives birth to attachment
and desire. In fact, the objects with which he renders service to
others, belong to them. So, there is no obligation if their trust
property is returned to them. Does anyone want reward for having
washed his face with his own hands?

Question:—How can service be rendered without objects and
money etc? So, what is the harm if anyone desires money and
objects, in order to render service to others?

Answer:—Service, with material objects is, a gross type of
service. Real service is a sentiment or feeling, and not an action.
Action leads to bondage, while service, releases from bondage.
"
427,"386 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3 -
A sense of service impels a man to use his possessions, in the .
service of others. Real service is rendered through feelings, rather ,
than through actions. A man of generous feelings can render
service even with limited resources, he has. He, who attaches
importance to objects cannot render service, with these, because -
he has pride in doing so, and thus he derives pleasure out of his
action, whether he knows it or not. A shopkeeper, gives articles
to others, but he does not render service, because he has a desire -
to receive money in exchange. Similarly, money which 1s paid as
tax to the king (state), cannot be called, charity. If a person offers -
charity or food or water to someone, in order to reap its fruit,
his affinity for the object is not renounced. But, if he offers the
articles, without expecting any reward, it means that he renders
service and his affinity for those objects, is renounced.
Only he who lays claim to a thing i.e., is the real owner of
a thing, can receive such a thing given by us. We, repay debt,
by offering the thing back to him. He, who is in greater need of -
something actually, is a deserving hand to receive it. He takes
it from us, only if it is his, otherwise not. ;
He, who renders service to others from his heart, arouses
feelings of service in their hearts also. If, this feeling is not
aroused in their hearts, it means that there has been a flaw (such _
as of reaping the fruit) in the service. A striver, should be on
the alert, in this respect. While rendering service, he should
never expect to be called, virtuous or good, because this feeling
develops pride in him.
A striver, should live in the world, in order to render service
to others by performing his duty. He should never cause any harm /
to anyone, in the least. He should share the joys and sorrows
of others, because that gives them moral strength, that there 1s
someone who is sharing their joys and sorrows. In this way,
happy men will become happier and the sad will be consoled.
He should console the sad, by quoting Lord Rama, king Nala and |
"
428,"Verse 34] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 387 -
king Hariscandra etc., who had to face adverse situations, though

they were very noble and virtuous. Moreover, there are many

others who are in a more pitiable condition. Thus one should try

to console them, be prepared to help them and remain engaged |

in their welfare, by having good feelings. Those, who share the :
pleasures and pains of others, are saints (Manasa 7/38/1).

Now a doubt may arise, that we shall never be free from
sorrow, if we share the sorrow of other people, because the world /
is full of it. To share, the sorrow of others, means to have the
feeling to alleviate their suffering and to make efforts for it. This ~
will give us happiness, rather than make us sad. The explanation
is, that other people will also share our sorrows i.e., they will
try to help us, in doing away with our sorrow. So, we should
try to share the sorrow of others from our heart, and according .
to our resources. When we share their sorrow, all our resources
are automatically, utilized, to relieve them of their sorrow and
suffering. It is beyond our power to make others happy, but it is -
upto us to use our resources, in order to help the sad in removing
their sorrow. This renunciation of the means of happiness, will -
bring us peace of mind. ;:

A striver should always have the feeling that no. one should
ever suffer in the least. Everyone is free, in having such generous |
feeling. This feeling is a service itself. Actions and objects are
limited, while feeling of generosity, is unlimited. So a striver can
attain the unlimited Lord, by unlimited feelings. How can He be
attained by the limited resources such as actions and objects?
Therefore, those whose possessions and resources are limited,
can also render great service, by having generous feelings.

A striver, who does not regard the body, senses, mind and
intellect etc., as his, can share the joys, and sorrows of others. In
fact, the body, senses, mind and intellect etc., are neither his nor
for him. Similar, is the case with objects, resources and persons.

These are also not his personal property. Everyone, whether he is
"
429,"388 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 ;
rich or poor, educated or uneducated, can renounce this assumed
affinity for these. As soon as, this assumed affinity is renounced,
and one renders service to others, by those things regarding them
as theirs, he gets rid of attachment and aversion, easily. -
‘Tau hyasya paripanthinau’—In the spiritual discipline,
attachment and aversion, are the waylayers to rob a striver, of
his spiritual property. But, a striver does not pay heed to this fact.
Therefore, he does not progress in the spiritual field as much as
he should have. Generally, strivers complain that they cannot
concentrate their minds, on God. But this lack of concentration -
is not such a stumbling block, as are attachment and aversion.
When attachment and aversions are renounced, the mind can
easily concentrate.
_ Total renunciation of actions, pertaining to one's nature, -
is beyond a striver's power, but their performance without
attachment and aversion, is within his power. So, the Lord |
urges strivers, not to come under their sway for these are his -
waylayers. In fact, attachment and aversion are naturally perishing.
But, a striver by holding that they dwell in him, accepts their -
existence and then acts, by coming under their influence. So he
does not get rid of them. If he holds that they do not dwell in
him and so he does not act, being swayed by them, these will :
automatically perish.
Appendix—When we assume that others are instrumental in
providing pleasure and pain to us, then attachment and aversion
ensue viz., we get attached to the thing which we think provides
pleasure to us and have aversion to the thing which provides pain |
to us. Therefore attachment and aversion are born by one’s own
error, there is no other reason. It is because of attachment and
aversion that we fail to perceive the world as the manifestation
of God but we view it as insentient (inert) and perishable. If
attachment and aversion are rooted out, it is not insentient but
all manifests as God—‘vasudevah sarvam’ (Gita 7/19). —
"
430,"Verse 34] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 389

When evils such as attachment and aversion appear, one
should not come under their sway viz., he should not perform
forbidden actions being swayed by them. Being affected by them,
if actions are performed, the evils (flaws) will be strengthened. -
But if actions are not done being swayed by them, the man will
be filled with enthusiasm. For example, if anyone uttered bitter
words to .us but we didn’t get angry, we would be filled with 7
enthusiasm and joy that we could escape anger. But we should
hold that it was not done by our own power; but by God’s grace
otherwise we would have been overpowered by it. If a striver -
perceives any defect, he should not be under its sway and should
not assume it in him. If attachment and aversion had existed
in the self, they would have remained as long as the self had
existed. But this is everyone’s experience that we ever exist but _
attachment and aversion don’t stay forever, they are fleeting.
Attachment and aversion can’t have an access to the self because
the self’s category is quite different from that of attachment and -
aversion. He, who knows the fleeting nature of attachment and
aversion, is different from them. Therefore attachment and aversion -
are different from us and they are also different from the mind
and intellect etc., in which they make a visit—‘manogatan’
(Gita 2/55). ‘Indriyasyendriyasyarthe ragadvesau vyavasthitau’— .
this expression means that a man should not be attached to
desirable or undesirable circumstances but should make proper
use of them viz., in desirable circumstances he should serve
others while in undesirable circumstances he should give up the
desire for favourable circumstances. The expression ‘tayorna vaSa- .
magacchet’ means that he should not be happy and sad in
favourable and unfavourable circumstances. To feel happy and
sad means to be attached to the fruit of action and the person
who is attached to the fruit of action gets tied down—‘phale
sakto nibadhyate’ (Gita 5/12).

'Sreyan*svadharmo vigunah paradharmatsvanusthitat'—The -
duty of another person according to his caste, order of life, —
etc., may outwardly seem full of merit, be easy to perform,
be attractive, provide riches, comforts, honour and praise etc., -
and enable one to live with comfort throughout his life, yet as
forbidden to him. These are fraught with fear (pain). On the other
hand, one's own duty, according to one's caste and order of life,
may be devoid of merit, be difficult to perform, not appealing and
not providing riches, comforts, honour or praise etc., and may be ;
painful, throughout life, yet these should be performed without
expecting any reward, as these leads to salvation. Therefore, a
person should always perform his duty, without expecting any ~
reward, without a sense of ‘mine’ and without attachment.
Performance of duty, for a man is but natural and innate. A
man is born, according to his actions, and actions are decided,
by his birth (Gita 18/41). Through the performance of his own
duty, he attains perfection (Gita 18/45). Therefore, one should
not give up one's duty ordained by one's nature, even if it seems
* The term ‘Jyayasi' (Superior) (3/1) used in the question put by Arjuna and
the term 'Sreyan' are synonymous. It means that the Lord has answered Arjuna's
question in this verse with particular attention. |
"
432,"Verse 35] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 391 -
to be tainted with blemish (Gita 18/48).

Arjuna thinks, it is better to live in this world by begging,
than to fight (Gita 2/5). So the Lord makes it clear to Arjuna, that
begging being the duty of a beggar, is not his duty, because he _
is a Ksatriya (a member of the warrior class), and not a beggar. |
In the first chapter, when Arjuna said that only sin would accrue
to them by fighting (1/36), the Lord said, that having abandoned
his own duty and forfeited his fame, he would incur sin (2/33). -
Further, the Lord declared, ""Treating alike pleasure and pain,
gain and loss, victory and defeat, engage thou in battle; thus, -
thou shall not incur sin"" (2/38). In the eighteenth chapter also
He declares, ""Better is one’s own duty though devoid of merit,
than the duty of another well performed and he who performs
his duty ordained by one's own nature, incurs no sin"" (18/47). _
It means, that a man incurs sin only when duty is performed
with attachment and aversion. When a striver performs his duty :
scrupulously, being free from attachment and aversion, he realizes :
equanimity, which leads him to freedom from sorrow and pain (Gita
6/23). So the Lord urges Arjuna, time and again, to perform his -
duty of fighting without attachment and aversion. By performing
his duty he would be detached from actions, develop dispassion,
and attain the goal of life. Through the selfless performance of ;
duty, actions flow towards nature (prakrti) and so a striver has
no affinity for these. Therefore, a striver should perform his duty,
with the view to root out attachment, for actions.

Lord Krsna is convincing Arjuna that having taken birth
in the warrior class and fighting is his duty he had to treat
alike victory and defeat, gain and loss, and pleasure and pain
believing that he had no concern as such with war but he had to
act in order only, to remove attachment with actions. The body,
senses, mind, intellect and matter etc., are meant for performing
duty alone.

One's duty done according to one’s caste and order of life, ,
"
433,"392 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
even though it may appear devoid of merit, leads to salvation.

A Ksatriya's duty of fighting, which involves violence may seem |
devoid of merits as compared with that of a Brahmana such as
serenity, self-restraint, austerity, purity and forgiveness etc., yet _
a Ksatriya (member of the warrior class) should fight, as it will

lead him to salvation.

According to one's caste and order of life etc., outwardly = __
actions (duties) may seem terrible or mild, but these are performed :
with the only aim of God-realization. When a person forgets the
real aim of life i.e., God-realization and attaches importance to -
worldly objects, actions seem terrible or mild to him. Under no
circumstances should one, discard his duty.

'Svadharme nidhanam éreyah'— If people ever gained, comfort,
pleasure, property, riches, honour and praise etc., by performing ~
their duty, there could be seen crowds of righteous people. But,
duty is not performed, keeping in view pleasure or pain, but
it is performed according to the teachings of the Lord or the ;
scriptures, without expecting any reward. So, while performing
his duty, if a striver suffers pain, that pain leads him to his 7
spiritual progress. In fact, that pain is not pain, but is penance or
austerity, which is conducive to progress, as penance is performed
for ones own self, while duty is performed for others. Penance :
which is performed intentionally, does not prove so beneficial,
as penance, in the form of pain, which comes uninvited.Those
who die while performing their duty, become immortal. From
the worldly point of view also, it is observed, that those who
do not deviate from their duty in spite of suffering pain, are
admired and honoured. Patriots who suffered tortures, went to
jail and were hanged, in order to make the country independent, _
are praised and honoured even today. On the other hand, those
who are sent to jail, because of their crimes are condemned and
dishonoured. It means, that the person who performs his duty
without expecting any reward, may suffer pain and even may meet
"
434,"Verse 35] : SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 393 7
with death, but that pain wins honour and praise here, and leads .
him to salvation hereafter, because he has an eye on righteousness.
Question:—How to know for certain, that death while )
performing one's own duty, leads only to salvation?
Answer:—The Gita is a gospel of Lord Krsna Himself. So, -
there should not arise any doubt, about His teaching. Secondly
it is a matter of faith and belief, rather than reasoning, yet some
aspects clarify the doubts: .
(1)—Whatever, is not known to us should be decided
by the scriptures.* It is mentioned in the scriptures, that he _
who protects righteousness, is protected by the righteous
(Manusmrti 8/15) ie., righteousness leads him to salvation.
Therefore, the responsibility of salvation of a person, who
follows righteousness falls on the righteous and the preachers
of righteousness, such as God, the Vedas, the scriptures and —
the sages and ascetics. It is their power which leads one to
salvation. In the scriptures, it is mentioned that a chaste woman,
attains salvation. She does not attain salvation, because of the -
virtues of her husband and his power, but because of the power
of the Lord, the Vedas and the scriptures etc., who have made -
this law (ordinance). There is no doubt about it.
(2) History also reveals the fact, that he who performs his
duty with righteousness attains salvation. King Hariscandra did not
deviate from truth, in the face of adversity, insult and dishonour.
Consequently, he along with his subjects attained the Supreme
Abode (Markandeya Purana, Devibhagavata etc.).
(3)—Nowadays we come across many incidents of rebirth,
which reveal that creatures take to higher or lower births according |
to their good or bad deedst.
* The scripture which removes doubts and reveals secrets, gives us all the light
of knowledge. Therefore, he who has no knowledge of the scriptures, is blind.

(4) Not to speak of a believer, even a non-believer, by — -
performing his duty scrupulously, without any selfish motive,
gains peace or joy, which is a characteristic of the mode of _
goodness. This peace, is a signal for salvation or the supreme peace.
Therefore, our own experience proves, that performance of one's .
duty while discarding forbidden actions, leads to salvation. |

It is the real duty of a man (the self), being a fragment of __
the Lord, to attain salvation and to believe, that he is, only the
Lord's and only the Lord is his. Even duty, according to one’s = —™
caste, stage of life and body etc., are not real duties because
these are assumed, and are not of the self. In all of these, a
man has to depend on others, while in one's own real duty,
he is totally independent and without the least dependence, on
anyone. Therefore, a striver himself may be a lover, a seeker of
knowledge or a devotee, as he has not to depend on anyone else.

A lover, transmuted by love, becomes one with the Beloved; a
seeker of knowledge, transmuted by knowledge, becomes one with

Him Who is all Knowledge, and a servant changed by service, -
becomes one with the Master. Similarly a striver transformed by
Sadhana, (Spiritual discipline) becomes one with God.

A striver having the aim of God-realization, does not hanker ;
after riches, honour, praise, comforts and luxuries. He is not at |
all worried about these, nor is he pleased having acquired them,
because his aim is only God-realization, rather than acquisition
of riches, honour and praise etc. So all the worldly actions, are
performed scrupulously and solemnly, for the Lord's sake by
him. As a businessman, takes a lot of trouble, to earn more and
more money, and as a patient, undergoes an operation happily,
in order to recover from a disease; a striver remains pleased and
satisfied, even in defeat, loss and pain, in order to attain his aim
of God-realization. For him, the desirable and the undesirable
circumstances, are the means to practise spiritual discipline.
"
436,"Verse 35] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI | 395 _

When a sStriver, having resolved to realize God, starts :
performing his duty scrupulously, he does not deviate from the
performance of his duty, even in the face of adversity. He faces
that adversity happily, taking it to be a penance.

When a striver, assumes the body as 'T and ‘mine’, it submits ~
to attachment and aversion. While coming under the sway of
attachment and aversion, a man strays away from his duty. Had
the body been 'T (the self), it would have remained with the self, -
or the self would have been destroyed with the destruction of
a body. But it is not so. Similarly, if the body had been mine, _
nothing would have remained to be acquired, after acquiring it.

But, the desire to acquire more, continues. It means that the real

thing has not yet been acquired, and the acquired things, such as

the body etc., are not mine. How can the body be mine, when I

have neither brought it with me, nor can carry it with me, nor -

can change it as I desire? Thus, every striver knows that a body

is neither ‘he' nor ‘his’. But the strivers do not attach importance

to this knowledge, so they cannot get rid of attachment and ;

aversion. If a striver sometimes, happens to feel a body as 'T'

and ‘mine’, he should instead of attaching importance to this -

feeling, give importance to his knowledge. By this, he realizes

the self, and then he gets rid of attachment and aversion. Being

free from attachment, the knowledge, of what ought to be done
_ and what ought not to be done, is naturally revealed in his mind

and accordingly actions are performed.

‘Paradharmo bhayavahah'—Though the performance of
duty of another, appears easy, yet it is fraught with fear 1.e., its
consequence is disastrous. Having discarded, selfish motive, if
a man performs his duty for the good of others, there is no fear
for him, from any quarters. |

Question:—Having described the duties, of Brahmanas
(priest class), Ksatriyas (warrior class), Vaisyas (trader class)
and Sidras (labour class) in the forty-second, forty-third and
"
437,"396 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 _
forty-fourth verses respectively, the Lord, in the first half of the ~
forty-seventh verse declared, ""Better, is one's own duty destitute
of merit, than the duty of another well performed."" According to
the present verse, the duty of another is said to be fraught with |
fear. Therefore, the duty of a Brahmana should be disastrous -
for others, such as the Ksatriya etc. But scriptures advise all |
people to inculcate the inborn qualities of a Brahmana in their
lives. Why? | -
Answer:—Controlling of the mind and senses etc.,
(Gita 13/7—11; 16/1—3) are common duties, which should be -
performed by everyone. These are natural duties for a Brahmana,
so he can perform these easily, while members of other castes,
may not perform these so easily. Common duties are also a part
and parcel of natural duties. Besides the common duties, when
a man performs duties born of his nature, he does not incur _
sin, though it may appear that he incurs sin. For example, if
a Ksatriya fights valiantly without selfishness and malice, by
regarding it as his duty he incurs no sin. The Lord declares,""He -
who performs his duty ordained according to his nature, incurs
no sin” (18/47). Besides common duty and one's own duty, the _
duty of another is fraught with fear, because it is prohibited by
scripture. It will deprive other persons of their rightful means
of livelihood, and it will lead him to hell. Therefore, the Lord -
asks Arjuna to perform his duty of fighting, which is better than
begging. Begging, is prohibited for Arjuna, being a Ksatriya it
is not beneficial for him.
Nature (prakrti) and its evolute (body and world), are different
from God and the self (soul). Duty of the self is one's duty,
while the duty of nature, the body and the world, is the duty of
another. Absence of modification, flawlessness, imperishability,
eternity, desirelessness and non-attachment, are duties of the
self, while modifications, flaws, transitoriness, mortality and
"
438,"Verse 35] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 397
desires for pleasures, prosperity, honour and praise etc., are the |
duties, of the body and the world and therefore, are the duties
of another. The duty of the self is imperishable, because the self
is imperishable, while the duty of the body is perishable, as the
body ever undergoes change. -

Renunciation, (the Discipline of Action), knowledge (the
Discipline of Knowledge) and love (the Discipline of Devotion),
being axiomatic, are one's own duty. These need no practice, as
practice is done by the body and whatever has affinity for the :
body, is the duty of another. |

To be united with God, is one’s own duty, while to be a -
pleasure seeker, is the duty of another; to remain detached is
one's duty, while to be attached is the duty of another; to render
service is one’s own duty while to have desire is the duty of
another; to be a lover is one's own duty while to be passionate ~
is the duty of another. It means, that whatever 1s connected
with the self is, one’s own duty, while whatever is connected
with nature (prakrti), is the duty of another. One's own duty is 7
sentient, while the duty of another is insentient.

The self is a fragment of God while the body is a fragment -
of nature (prakrti). The desire for Self-realization and God-
realization, is the duty of the self, because the self is a fragment
of God, while the desire for pleasure and prosperity is the duty :
of another (paradharma). This desire for pleasure and prosperity,
is aroused by accepting affinity for an unreal body. A desire
for one's ultimate good, is one's duty because being a fragment
of God, one's own desire is the desire of God Himself, and not
that of the world.

A man is independent in performing his own duty of God-
realization or Self-realization or salvation, because in this there
is no need of body, senses, mind and intellect etc., but only
the need to sever connection with them. In performing duty for
another, a man is dependent because that needs the body, senses,
"
439,"398 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA — [Chapter3 :
mind, intellect, things and persons etc. :

When a man practises spiritual discipline in order to realize
God, without accepting his affinity for the body, his practice is
his own duty. All the means followed, in order to attain Self-
realization or God-realization, are included in one's own duty =
(svadharma) while all the actions done for the world, are included
in the duty for another (paradharma). Thus, practising the three
Disciplines (Action, Knowledge and Devotion) is a man's own ;
duty, while hankering after worldly pleasures and prosperity,
having accepted affinity for the body, is the duty of another.

All the virtuous actions such as a pilgrimage, fast, penance,
meditation and trance etc., performed with physical, subtle and
causal bodies, with the expectation of reward 1.e., with a selfish
motive, turn to be 'paradharma’ (the duty of another). But if these

are performed for the welfare of others, without expecting any -
reward, these become, 'svadharma’ (one's own duty). The reason is,
that the self is desireless, while desire is born by having affinity
for nature (prakrti). So, when a man having desire, performs his 7
duty, it becomes the duty of another. One's own duty, leads to
salvation, while the duty of another leads to bondage. -

Every man having a disinclination for the duty of others,
should perform his own duty of God-realization or Self-realization,
for which this human body has been bestowed upon him. As far
as, the performance of duty of another is concerned it can be
performed in lower births as also heaven etc., where the only
aim is the enjoyment of pleasures. A man is independent and
capable of performing his own duty, while he is dependent and
incapable of performing the duty of another. He is sad when
he has a desire to acquire worldly objects, and depends on them
having acquired them. This dependence is 'paradharma’ (the duty
of another). But, when there is no desire, there is no question of
any want or dependence. That is 'svadharma' (one's own duty).

While performing one's own duty, a man may have to undergo
"
440,"Verse 35] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 399 -
a lot of suffering adversity, and even may lose his life, but it oe
will lead him to salvation (God-realization), while the duty of
another, even though full of merit and easy to perform, is fraught
with danger i.e., leads him to the cycle of birth and death.
All the pains, sorrows and worries eétc., of the world, are born -
by the performance of the duty of another, while the performance
of one's own duty leads him to the eternal bliss.
Appendix—<According to his birth and actions whatever a ”
striver assumes himself, his ‘dharma’ (duty) is ‘svadharma’ for
him and whatever is forbidden for him, that is ‘paradharma’ =
(duty of another) for him; as a striver assumes_himself to be
of a particular ‘Varna’ (order of life) and ‘Agrama’ (stage of
life), for him the duty of the man of that ‘Varna’ and ‘Aérama’
is ‘svadharma’. If he thinks himself to be a pupil or a teacher,
study or teaching is ‘svadharma’ for him. If he assumes -
himself to be a servant or inquisitive (Jijiiasu) or devotee, then service
or inquisitiveness or devotion is ‘svadharma’ for him. Evils such as
theft and violence etc., which involve ill and harm of others cannot
be ‘svadharma’ for anyone but that is “kudharma’ or ‘Adharma’.*
Performance of action in a disinterested way for the welfare of
others (viz., Karmayoga) is ‘svadharma’. In the Gita “svadharma’
(one’s own duty) has been mentioned ‘sahajakarma’, ‘svakarma’ |
and “svabhavajakarma’.
Performance of action against one’s duty is ‘akartavya’ and ,
‘not to discharge one’s duty’ is also ‘akartavya’ (neglecting of
duty) (Gita 2/33).
*In every dharma these three are there—‘kudharma’, ‘adharma’ and ‘para-
dharma’. The feeling to harm others and diplomacy etc., are ‘kudharmain dharma’.
To kill an animal in a sacrifice is “adharma in dharma’. The ‘dharma’ of the people
of other “Varna’ and ‘ASrama’ is ‘paradharma in dharma’. Kudharma, adharma
and paradharma—these three don’t lead a person to salvation. The dharma (duty)
which involves renunciation of selfishness & pride and welfare of others at present
and in future leads to salvation. | |

Link:—Why does a man not perform his own duty, when he
knows that one's own duty is better, even though devoid of merit
than the duty of another, well discharged? For this Arjuna, puts
a question, in the verse that follows— :

TAT SH

arjuna uvaca — _
atha kena prayukto'yam papam carati pirusah
anicchannapi varsneya baladiva _oniyojitah
Arjuna said:

But, why is a man impelled to commit sin, as if by force, even 7
against his will, O Varsneya (Krsna)? 36 ©
Comment:— | | -

""Atha kena prayukto'yam papam carati pirusah anicchannapi
varsneya baladiva niyojitah'—Lord Krsna has been addressed as
'Varsneya’, because he belonged to the Vrsni clan. In the preceding ;
verse, Lord Krsna praised the performance of one's duty, and
duty as performed, according to one's caste and clan. So Arjuna,
addresses the Lord as Varsneya. A sensible man does not want
to commit sin, by thinking of its bitter and sad fruit.

Here the term 'anicchan' does not mean, discarding desire for
pleasure and prosperity. It rather, stands for the renunciation of
desire, to commit sin. A sensible man does not want to commit
sin, but it is the desire for pleasure and prosperity, which deviates
him from the performance of his duty and forces him to perform
sinful acts.

The expression 'baladiva niyojitah' (as if driven by force) has
been used, to point out the fact that a sensible man, by knowing
the bitter fruit of a sinful act does not want to commit it, yet
"
442,"Verse 36] | SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 401
he is forcibly driven to it. From this, it appears that some force
is there, to compel him to commit sins.

The root of this sin 1s desire, for worldly pleasures ,
and prosperity. But a man does not give any heed to this :
desire, and so he is unable to know the root of evils (sins).

He understands that he wants to abstain from committing sins,
but some entity is forcibly engaging him, in sins. Duryodhana 7
also declares:— _ |

""I know what 1s righteousness, but I am not inclined to it; _
I also know what is unrighteousness, but [ cannot get rid of It.

There is some ‘deva' (force) in my heart, which drives me to
act"" (Garga-Samhita, ASvamedha. 50/36).

The term 'deva' used by Duryodhana stands for desire, (for
pleasure and prosperity) which forces him to commit sin, and ~
not to follow righteousness.

The expression 'Kena prayukto'yam papath carati'—also -
shows that he is impelled to commit sin by some other force.

The Lord, in the thirty-fourth verse, said, ""Attachment and -
aversion (which are subtle forms of desire and anger) are, the
foes of a striver (i.e., these are the roots of sins)"". As it was
said in a general way, Arjuna could not understand this point.

So he puts this question. Arjuna, means to ask whether it is

lack of faith or carping spirit or villainous nature or clouded
understanding or force of one's own nature or attachment and
aversion, or disinclination for one's own duty and inclination to |
the duty of another (described from the thirty-first verse to the
thirty-fifth verse), which drives a man to commit sin. Besides

these, is it God or fortune or time or circumstance or action or

bad company or society or custom or any government law etc.,

which is impelling him to commit sin? |

The Blessed Lord said:

It is desire and it is anger, born of the mode of passion —
(rajas), most greedy and most sinful. Know this to be the enemy
concerned, 37 |
Comment:— |

""Rajogunasamudbhavah'—The Lord, in the seventh verse of
the fourteenth chapter, declares, ""The mode of passion springs ~
from desire and attachment"", while here, He declares that desire
is born of a mode of passion. It means, that desire is born of -
the mode of passion, while desire enhances passion (attachment).

A person believes that worldly objects provide him pleasure,

so he has a desire to acquire them in order to enjoy pleasure. 7
This desire, gives birth to attachment. So long as this process
continues, he cannot get rid of sinful acts. ,

'Kama* esa krodha esa'—A man, has a desire for sensual /
pleasure and prosperity. Sometimes, sins are committed under
the sway of desire, while other times, these are committed,
under the sway of anger. Through desire and anger, different :
types of sins are committed. Therefore, these two terms have
been used. This desire is the root of all sint. When it is not

*'T should get this, I should get this——this is desire. Such a desire is known
as ‘Kama’. |

TThough disinclination for God and not attaching importance to
discrimination are also the cause of sins, yet here desire has been said to be the
root of sins because here in this chapter of the Discipline of Action, the aim of a
striver is to get rid of desire.
"
444,"Verse 37] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 403 :
satisfied, it gives birth to anger. The singular number, has been
used for desire and anger in order to explain that only desire
is the root of sins.
When a desire is satisfied, it gives birth to greed; but if
it is not satisfied, it gives birth to anger. If the person, who |
is a stumbling block to the satisfaction of our desire, is more
powerful than we, fear is born instead of anger. Therefore, in
the Gita, besides desire and wrath, fear has also been mentioned -
as ‘delivered from desire, fear and anger’ (4/10) and ‘free from
desire, fear and anger’ (5/28). _
Whatever we may desire, does not happen, and whatever we
do not desire, happens—this is suffering. Desire is the root of all
sins and sufferings. A man with a desire cannot get happiness, ~
even in a dream (Manasa 7/90/1). If desire is renounced, there
is no question of any suffering. | -
Craving for perishable objects, is called desire, while the
need for God-realization, which may appear to be like desire,
is not really desire. The reason is, that desire is never satisfied, a
but it is strengthened by sense enjoyments, while the need of
God-realization, is fulfilled having realized God. A man has
desire for something, which is different from him (the self),
while God is one with the self. Similarly, the need of rendering
selfless service (the Discipline of Action), Self-realization (the
Discipline of Knowledge) and devotion to God (the Discipline |
of Devotion) are not desires. In fact, the need of the self (soul)
is to realize God but he (the self) has a desire to acquire the
perishable objects etc., because his discrimination is veiled.
A doubt may arise here as to how the worldly affairs will
go on, without desire. The clarification is, that worldly affairs
relate with actions and commodities; rather than with desires.
Actions are performed outwardly and so their fruit in the form
"
445,"404 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3 -
of objects and circumstances etc., is also external, while desire
is internal.

Nothing in the world, can be acquired by having desire. It
is the fruit of effort. People have a desire to become rich, yet |
they remain poor. All the people, except the liberated souls, -
have a desire to remain alive, but they die. A man's actions
bear fruits, according to his fate or fortune, not because of his
desire. Whatever, is allotted cannot be blotted, whether you have -
desire for it or not. As, a man has to undergo unfavourable
circumstances unwillingly, he would also face favourable _

- circumstances. A man may bear pain, blame and dishonour etc.,
without any desire. Similarly, he may gain pleasure, praise and
honour, without desire as a result of his fate.

A man may have a desire for immediate pleasures and
prosperity, or for future fruits, for his actions. But a desire is ~
the root of pain, here as well as hereafter, so a man should

_- renounce, desire. -

It is out of desire that a man performs actions. When there

is an excess of this desire, it forces him to perform forbidden
actions. It is because of desire that he is more attached, to the -
unreal. As soon as, he renounces desire, his affinity for the
unreal is renounced.

When desire is satisfied, we attain the same. state in
which we were, before desire was aroused. When desire, say
of receiving a hundred rupees, was not aroused in a striver's
mind, he was desireless, and again after having received that
amount, he becomes desireless. It is because of his attachment
to the worldly pleasures, that new desires are born. Thus, desire
are never satisfied.

Some people beliéve that desires cannot be totally renounced.

But the fact is, that desires cannot be maintained. These appear
and disappear, have a beginning and an end, and constantly
decay. If we do not have new desire, the old desire, whether |
"
446,"Verse 37] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 405 .
satisfied or not, disappears itself.
Everyone's desires, may not be satisfied forever but these can
be renounced forever, because these are transitory. The difficulty
in renouncing desire is, that we have a feeling of ‘mine’. If we
become free from this feeling of ‘mine’, we shall become, desireless. :
Desirelessness will lead to detachment. When we become free
from the feeling of ‘mine’, desire and attachment, we attain
uniformity, desirelessness and independence automatically. -
We must pay attention to this vital fact. We think that it is
difficult to renounce desires. But is it easy to satisfy these? It -
is impossible to satisfy all the desires. Even king DaSaratha, the
father of Lord Rama, could not satisfy his desire, of not sending
his son into exile. Thus, if satisfaction of desires is impossible,
and renunciation is difficult. Which one is easier—satisfaction or
renunciation? The answer 1s clear, that desires can be renounced 7
rather than satisfied. But we commit an error when we try to
satisfy desires, but we do not make efforts to renounce them.
Therefore, a striver should renounce desires.
Desires are of four kinds:— -
1. Desires which satisfy necessities of life.*
2. Desire which is personal and just, but is beyond our
power. Such a desire should be rooted out, by offering it to GodT.
* There are four criteria for such a desire—
(i) It is born at present (as desire for food when one is hungry).
(ii) The material to satisfy it is available at present. -
(iii) It is impossible to live without satisfying it.
(iv) It's satisfaction does evil neither to him nor to others.
Thus the necessity should be satisfied. When the necessities are satisfied, a
man gets strength to renounce desires. But he should not derive pleasure out of
the satisfaction of even necessities otherwise it will be conducive to the birth of
new desires which can never be satisfied.
t'There should not be injustice and exploitation in the world.’ A striver
having offered such a desire to God, becomes carefree. The Lord satisfies it if
He thinks it proper.
"
447,"-— 406 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 -

3. Satisfy the just desire of others for their welfare and
within our power to satisfy. Thus by satisfying the desires of

| others, we get strength to renounce our own.

4. Other desires, besides, the above-mentioned ones, which ~
can be rooted out, by reflection. -

_ ""MahaSano mahapapma'—Desire is such an enemy, that is
not satiated by, sense-enjoyments. Tulasidasa in Vinaya Patrika
declares, “This fire of desire is never extinguished by the churned- ~
butter of sense-enjoyments"" (198). |

As desire for prosperity, is never satisfied, similarly, the desire -
for sense-enjoyments, is never satisfied, but rather strengthened.
So, it has been called, all devouring, and most sinful, because
it is the root of all sinful actions, such as theft, robbery. and
violence etc. : ,

As soon as, desire is born, it induces man to have a
disinclination for his duty, for the self and for God, and an
inclination towards perishable world. Consequently, he commits -
sins, which lead to hell and birth, in lower bodies. |

It is, because of the desire for sense-enjoyments, that the _
changing and perishable world, (body etc.,) seems real and one
seeks pleasure out of it. At the time of enjoyment, he forgets the
kaleidoscopic nature of objects and regards these and himself, as
permanent. If he realized this fact, he, instead of getting entangled
in the mirage of pleasures, will have his eye directed to God and
the Self, Who are real. It shows, that a man enjoys the worldly
sense-enjoyments, by having a disinclination for the real, God _
or Self; and by enjoying the sense-enjoyments, he develops a
disinclination for God. .

Such a depraved one can't avoid violence, for himself as
well as, for others. When a rich man leads a luxurious life and
enjoys worldly pleasures, the poor are sad, to see him, suffer.
Moreover, he (the self) being a fragment of God is sentient, but
when one attaches importance to riches or luxuries, the insentient,
"
448,"Verse 37] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 407 -
he becomes a slave to these and has a downfall. Ail the worldly

materials are limited, so these should be shared by all the people.

He, who enjoys the share of others, 1s a sinner. So a man, should

have only the bare necessities of life. In the scriptures, it is :
mentioned that even bare necessities of life should be satisfied, :
only after offering these to parents, preceptors, children,women

and old people etc.

A gratifier destroys worldly material, does violence to those who -
suffer shortage, and leads himself to a downfall, while a wise man
(liberated soul) does not do so, because all actions, are performed ~
by him, according to scriptural injunctions for the maintenance
of a body, without expecting any fruit (Gita 4/21; 18/17). All the
possessions, including the body of such a wise man, are utilized
automatically, for the welfare of all beings. 7

The need to maintain the body, is neither all-devouring nor |
most sinful, and it is satisfied, as hunger, after having a meal.

But a desire is never fully satisfied, the more we satisfy it, the -
more intense it becomes.

""Viddhyenamiha vairinam'—lIn fact, a man attains peace, having -
renounced the desire for worldly objects. Yet out of ignorance
he believes that he has attained peace by acquiring the worldly
objects (i.e., by satisfying the desire). Thus, by considering desire 7
to be a source of enjoyment, he regards it as a friend and well-
wisher. So, the desire never perishes. Therefore, the Lord urges
us to know the desire, to be an enemy, because it, having blurred
our discrimination, leads us to sins.

Desire, is the root of all sins, sufferings and hell, here as
well as hereafter. It results in no benefit.

An important and easy means, to get rid of desire, is to

render service to others with the body, senses, mind, intellect
and life-breath etc., without any selfish motive. |
"
449,"408 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA -— [Chapter3
In the, Discipline of Action, actions performed with the
physical body, thinking with the subtle body and trance with
the causal body, are done only for the world, not for one's own
self, because the gross body, the subtle body and the causal body _
have their identity respectively, with the gross, subtle and causal
world. By doing so, one should not derive any pleasure out of
them.* It makes him free from attachment, to the fruit of action
and thus he easily becomes free from attachment to action. 7
'T should be obeyed’, ‘this thing may serve my purpose’,
‘Whatever, I say should be honoured'—these are all desires. A ~
desire is very disastrous. When a man satisfies the just desires
of others, according to his resources, it enables him to renounce
his own desires. If we cannot fulfil the desires of others, at Jeast
we should have the sentiment to do so. .
Egoism, attachment and desire, bind a man to the world,

- through separation, defect and disquietude, respectively.
Renunciation of desire, leads to detachment, while detachment -
leads to non-egoism. A striver, following the Discipline of
Action, does not regard the body, senses, mind, intellect, egoism _
and objects etc., as his or for him, but he regards these as the
world's and for the world, by realizing the reality about them.

_ When a striver resolves, not to give pain to others, he starts
rendering service to them. If by chance, anyone suffers because
of his action, he very humbly tenders a sincere apology. Even if
the sufferer does not forgive him, he is automatically forgiven _
by God. While rendering service to others, a striver should never
expect any reward in return. By doing so this enemy (desire) is
easily overcome. |

Appendix—The desire to derive pleasure from a thing, a

* The desire to derive pleasure out of either service or the thought of the
welfare of others or trance and to maintain them, is an obstacle to God-
realization (Gital4/6). Therefore, a striver should be detached from the three
modes—of goodness, of passion and of ignorance because the self is free
from all attachment. ,
"
450,"Verse 38] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 409 .
person or an action is named ‘kama’. This evil in the form of )
‘Kama’ involves endless flaws, endless defects and endless sins.
Therefore so long as a man has desire, he can’t be totally free
from flaws, defects and sins. The desire to get pleasure causes
evils. He who has no desire becomes free from evils.
The fruit of action is of three kinds—pleasant, unpleasant
and mixed (Gita 18/12). Out of the three the fruit of desire that
accrues is only unpleasant. _
Prarabdha does not compel a man to resort to sinful acts but
it is the desire that directs a man to sinful acts. An urge for an -
activity may be there for enjoyment of fruits of past actions due _
to Prarabdha but there cannot be any sinful act as there 1s no
need to commit such a sin for enjoyment of fruits of destiny.
Kama (desire) is born of ‘Rajoguna’ (the mode of passion).
Therefore the cause of sins is ‘Rajoguna’ and their effect (evolute) -
is “Tamoguna’ (the mode of ignorance). All sins are born of
“Rajoguna’. ,

embryo by placenta, so is this (knowledge) concealed by desire. 38
Comment:—
""‘Dhimenavriyate vahnih'— As fire is covered by smoke, so
is this knowledge, (discrimination) covered by desire.
Discrimination is revealed in the intellect. There are three
"
451,"410 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 |
divisions of intellect—of the nature of 'goodness' (Sattvika),
of ‘passion’ (Rajas) and of ‘ignorance’ (Tamas). The intellect
by which one knows, what ought to be done and what
ought not to be done, is of the nature of ‘goodness’. The |
intellect, by which one wrongly understands, what ought to .
be done and what ought not to be done, is of the nature of
‘passion’, while the intellect by which one sees all things in
a perverted way (contrary to the truth) is, of the nature of |
‘ignorance’ (Gita 18/30—32). When desire is born, even the
intellect of goodness (Sattvika) is covered by desire, as fire
by smoke, then the intellect of the mode of passion (Rajas) ©
and ignorance (tamas) will definitely be covered by it, of
which there is no doubt.

As soon as, a desire is born, one’s Spiritual path is covered
with its smoke. If it is given scope for enhancement, it makes -
the path totally dark. By thinking that the desired objects are
deserting us constantly, we can destroy desires.

We have desire to acquire the worldly objects, because |
these appear to be beautiful and charming. The desire veils
our discrimination, which is a privilege of human birth. Just ~
as, fire can burn even when it is covered with smoke, so can
discrimination work, if a man becomes cautious, as soon as desire
is born. A man can get rid of desire at the outset, by thinking —
of the kaleidoscopic and transitory nature, of the worldly objects
etc., which he wants to acquire.

""Yathadarso malena ca'—When dirt accumulates on the surface —
of a mirror, it cannot reflect an object. Similarly, the dirt of desire,
covers knowledge (discrimination), and a striver cannot decide
what he ought to do and what he ought not to do. Because of
desire, he hankers after worldly pleasures and prosperity, and he
has a downfall. This is the second stage of desire. | |

| A striver, should realize that it is not a thing, but its proper
use, which is significant. So, instead of having a desire to acquire
"
452,"Verse 38] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 411 -
more and more, he should think to make a proper use of it.
Moreover, he cannot acquire objects merely by desire. _

The less importance, he will attach to the worldly objects, the
more importance he will attach to God. When he stops attaching | |
importance to the worldly objects altogether, he will realize God .
and desire will totally be eliminated. |

'Yatholbenavrto garbhah'—When, dirt accumulates on the
surface of a murror, even though it does not reflect a face, yet - ;
it can be known that it is a mirror. But when an embryo is
covered by the placenta, it cannot be known, whether the child -
is male or female. Similarly, knowledge (discrimination) is, so
much veiled at this third stage, that he totally forgets his duty
and his desire is intensified.

If desire is not satisfied, it gives birth to anger. From --
anger arises delusion; from delusion there is destruction of ,
discrimination; from destruction of descrimination one does
not do, what ought to be done, but indulges in evil acts, -
such as falsehood, fraud, dishonesty, injustice, oppression and |
other sinful acts. The Lord does not want to call such people, ""
human beings (men). Therefore, the Lord while descnbing
such people, in the sixteenth chapter (from the eighth to the
eighteenth verses), has not used any such word which stands
for human beings. The Lord has called the people, who have
heaven as their goal, 'Kamatmanah' (desire incarnate) (Gita
2/43), because they are the embodiments of desires. Having
identified themselves with desires, they hold that there is no
higher aim than the gratification of desires (Gita 16/11).

[When desires are strengthened, a man totally forgets, that
the real aim of human life is God-realization. But if due to past
influences or good company, or any other factor, he comes to |
know the real aim of human life, he can attain salvation or
God-realization. ]
"
453,"412 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 _

'Tatha tenedamavrtam'—In this verse, the Lord has given |
three illustrations, pertaining to the covering of discrimination
by desire. It means that discrimination is covered by desire,
in three stages. But those who hold that desire is the cause of _
happiness, and so depend on it, cannot renounce it (desire), while .
strivers who practise spiritual discipline, know it in its reality —
and can root it out.

The Lord here, has described the three stages of desire, _
so that a striver may kill the enemy, in the form of desire,
as directed by Him, in the forty-first and forty-third verses _
of this chapter. In fact, desire crosses the first two stages so
quickly, that a man cannot perceive these phases. Then desire
leads him, to all sorts of sins and sufferings. Therefore, a
striver, through discrimination, should not allow a desire to
arise. But if it is born, it should be renounced either in the -
first or the second stage, it should not be allowed to reach
the third stage.

As smoke, shows the presence of fire, and as a mirror and an ~
embryo are identified even when these are covered respectively,
with dust and placenta, so discrimination is possessed by every
human being, even when it is covered by desire. But due to the ©
force of desire, discrimination is not used. .

According to the scriptures 'Mala' (sin) (Impurity), ""Viksepa’
(distraction) and ‘avarana' (veil), are said to be, the three
stumbling blocks to God-realization. These defects, are born
of the affinity of man, for the unreal world. This affinity
for the world is, created because of desire. Thus the root
of all the evils, is desire. When desire is renounced, affinity
for the unreal world, is renounced. When affinity for the
unreal, is renounced, all the evils perish and discrimimation
is revealed. |
"
454,"Verse 38] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 413
So long as, the worldly objects seem real, beautiful and :

charming, a man attaches importance to them. This attachment,

is the main obstacle to God-realization, as it 1s conducive to

the three defects—sin, confusion and veil. Out of these three,

sin is regarded as the most deadly defect. Desire is the root -

of sin. When a striver resolves not to commit sin in future,

the defects are rooted out and his sin, begins to decay. But

when he renounces the desire, totally, all his sins perish. -
In the Srimadbhagavata, Lord Krsna has pointed out

that a man with desire can attain salvation, by following the -

Discipline of Action (Performance of action) without expecting —

fruit—'Karmayogastu kiminam' (11/20/7). So a person who

is not free from desire, need not lose heart, because only

he who has a desire, will get rid of it. Desires can be -

renounced easily, through the Discipline of Action. When a

striver performs any act, whether it is mundane or spiritual, he

should think, ""Why do I perform it and how do I perform -

it?"" By thinking so, he will constantly have an eye on the

atm of his life. Consequently, he will perform only virtuous

actions, being free from attachment and the desire for fruit.

This performance of actions without attachment, and desire

for reward, will lead him to salvation.
Appendix—Desire is the main obstacle to God-realization. As

there is a jar full of water, in it we have to do two actions—the

first is to empty the jar and the second 1s to fill it with ether. |

But in fact two actions are not to be performed but only one

is to be performed—to empty the jar. Empty the jar and the

ether will be filled itself. Similarly renunciation of desire and

God-realization—these two are not be done. Renounce the desire

and God will be automatically realized. It is because of desire

that God seems to be unrealized.

Comment:—
. 'Etena'—This term has been used for desire, which has been -
declared by the Lord as most sinful, in the thirty-seventh verse
of this chapter. |
'Duspirenanalena ca'— As fire is never satiated, when clarified
butter is added to it, it rather rages stronger, so is desire never -
satisfied, by enjoying the objects of desire, it is rather strengthened
(Srimadbhagavata 9/19/14; Manusmrti 2/94). The fire of desire,
devours everything which comes into its contact. ;
Sundaradasa, has also expressed the same idea, when he
says, ""The richer a man grows, the more he hankers after worldly 7
prosperity. A poor man, may desire to gain only a few rupees,
but when he gains them, he has desire for a hundred and then a
thousand, and after that a million and then a billion and trillion |
and then the ownership of the entire universe. Yet, this form
of desire, will not be satiated. It is only, by contentment, that
this desire can be subdued. | |
A poor man, is not so greedy, as is a rich man. When a man
earns a hundred rupees, he desires to earn a thousand rupees. It -
means that he feels that he needs nine hundred more. When he
earns a thousand rupees, he desires to have, ten thousand rupees.
It means that he needs nine thousand more. When he gains ten
thousand rupees he has desire to gain a lac of rupees. And he
needs ninety thousand more. Thus the richer he grows, the more
"
456,"Verse 39] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 415 .
greedy he becomes. On the other hand, a contented man, being
free from all desires, is the king of kings.

In fact it is not wealth, but desire for wealth, which is an
obstacle to God-realization.This desire, deprives the rich and the ;
poor equally, of God-realization, as it can never be satiated. A
man can only get rid of it by renouncing it.

'Kamaripena'—The desire to derive pleasure, out of the /
affinity for the insentient is called ‘Kama’. This desire manifests
itself in different forms, such as lust (for gold, power and
of the flesh), craving (for things), attachment (to loving and -
charming objects), hope (to acquire something) and greed (to
acquire more and more). When a man's desire is intensified,
it is followed by solicitation. These are, the different forms
of desire. _

‘Jnanino nityavairina'—Here, the term ‘Jnaninah’ stands for
the wise striver, who remains engaged in practising the spiritual -
discipline, because it is he, who recognizes this enemy in the form
of desire, and slays it. The worldly people consider it as pleasant.

The Lord declares, that desire is the constant enemy of a ;
wise striver. As, soon as desire is born, a thought comes to
his mind, that it will lead him to suffering. Desires involve |
dependence on the world and create importance of the world,
which are stumbling blocks to the spiritual path. It pricks him
at the outset, that it will result in adversity. ,

The ignorant, who are engrossed in sensual pleasures, hold

that desire is their friend, because they derive pleasure out of ""
the objects. Without desire objects cannot provide pleasure.
But the fact is, that desire and the pleasures, lead him to
sorrow, suffering, imprisonment and hell etc. Thus, desire is |
a constant enemy of the ignorant also, but they are not aware
of it, while wise strivers are aware of it.

‘Avrtarn jiianam'—Every being is, endowed with
"
457,"416 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3 |
discrimination. In the case of man it can develop, but in birds,
beasts and other births, it is confined to the maintenance of the
body. In the case of men also, it is veiled by desire, which does
not let them follow the spiritual (sentient) path of God-realization,
but keeps them engaged in mundane pleasures.
Everyone, likes loving and true words, and hates harsh
and false words. It means that every person has the knowledge -
(discrimination) of good and bad, virtue and vice, right and
wrong. In spite of this knowledge, an ignorant person uses harsh
language, tells a lie and does not perform his duty scrupulously, -
because his discrimination is concealed by desire.
A man thinks that he derives joy out of sense-objects, but
in fact, he gets joy by renouncing them. Everyone knows that
during wakefulness and sleep a man feels happy and sad, because ~
of his affinity, for the sense-objects. But during sound sleep he
does not remember, sense-objects at all. So, when he awakes he ;
says that he had a very peaceful and sound sleep. Moreover, he
gets tired during wakefulness, while he is refreshed after sound
sleep. It means, that it is renunciation of the sense-objects, -
which provides joy or peace.
When a man desires money, his mind is attached to it. But
when it is acquired, the mind renounces this attachment and so
he feels happy. Had the money provided him joy, he would have
never felt sad, so long as he had money. But he feels sad, even
after possessing that money. |
When a man desires anything,’ he becomes dependant on
it. Suppose, a man has a desire to buy a watch he feels sad,
without it; this is dependence upon it. He thinks that if he
acquires money, he can buy a watch i.e., he feels independent
if he has money, and dependent without money. But this is
a wrong notion. If he acquires money and buys a watch he,
instead of having dependence on the watch, has dependence
"
458,"Verse 39] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI | 417
on money, because money is also different from, the self.

When a man's discrimination is hid by desire, he realizes his
dependence on objects, but he does not realize his dependence,

on money. He thinks that he has become independent, because .
of money. It is very difficult to renounce such a dependence,

which disguises itself as independence.

The world is transitory. All the worldly objects such as _
the body, wealth, property etc., are decaying every moment,
and are separating from us. But while enjoying these, we _
forget that they are temporary, we regard them as eternal and
permanent. Not to talk of the common people, even a striver
gets entangled in pleasures by considering ‘these as eternal
and permanent. It so happens, because his discrimination is
enveloped by desire. -

The Lord declares, that desire is the constant enemy of the
wise, so that a man may save himself from it and may attain -
bliss, desire being the root of all sins and suffermgs. Once,

a man was looking for his wife. People asked him, ""What is

the name of your wife?"" He replied, ""Disgrace."" They again |
asked ""What is your name?"" He replied, ""Wicked."" People

said, ""Don't be agitated, she is a very chaste and faithful wife,

she will come to you, because disgrace ever accompanies the |
wicked."" Similarly suffering automatically accompany the man,

who hankers after perishable pleasures.

A man wants to avoid suffering, but he does not
renounce desire, which is the root cause of suffering. In the
Ramacaritamanasa it is declared, ""A man can't attain bliss, even
in a dream, so long as he does not renounce desire"" (7/90/1). The
Lord, by the terms 'analena' and 'duspurena’, wants to explain
that desire for enjoyment of worldly objects, is never satiated.
"
459,"418 . SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 |
The more he enjoys them, the more, the desire for these is
strengthened. In order to satiate it, he is inclined to sinful acts.

When he has desire for wealth, he wants to earn it, by fair means

or foul. Then, at the second stage the desire engages him in theft :
and robberies, while in the third stage it leads him to commit
violence and even murder. Thus the desire for pleasure, makes

life miserable, here as well as hereafter. .

Appendix—-The main obstacle to the practice of spiritual
discipline is the desire for pleasure which is born by the
contact of senses with sense-objects. This obstacle lingers for -
a long time. Wherever a striver indulges in pleasure, there his
spiritual progress is arrested. As much as even the pleasure
(joy) from trance, hinders his progress.* Even the desire of
‘Sattvika’ happiness and attachment to it arrest his spiritual _
progress—‘sukhasangena badhnati’ (Gita 14/6)T. Therefore the
Lord has declared that desire is the constant enemy of a wise
(discriminating) striver—‘na tesu ramate budhah’ (Gita 5/22) and -
‘duhkhameva sarvarh vivekinah’ (Yogadarsana 2/15).

The senses, the mind and the intellect are said to be its
abode. Veiling of wisdom by the senses, mind and intellect

Comment:— -
'Indriyani mano buddhirasyadhisthanamucyate'—Desire, is |
said to have five abodes—({1) objects (Gita 3/34), (2) senses,
(3) mind, (4) intellect and (5) assumed ego (T’) viz., doer
(Gita 2/59). Though it seems to reside in five abodes, yet in fact, :
it resides in the ‘assumed ego’. As it seems to abide in these five
places, these are called its seats. : ~
All actions are performed, with the body, senses, mind and
intellect. If desire resides in these, it hinders the performance :
of spiritual actions. Therefore, a Karmayogi (man of action),
having abandoned attachment and the fruit of actions, performs -
actions, only by the body, senses, mind and intellect, for the
purification of the self (Gita 5/11). ,
In fact, desire resides in the assumed ego (i.e., identification :
of the self with the body etc.). This ego or ‘I'ness, is merely
assumed that, 'I belong to a particular caste, creed or order -
of life""—this is a mere assumption. Sins perish, after bearing
fruits, but desire which resides in the assumed ego, gives |
birth to new sins. Therefore, it is desire which binds the |
embodied soul.
In the Mahabharata, it is mentioned, ""In the world it is only
desire which binds a man. He who is liberated from the bondage |
of desire, becomes eligible to attain the Eternal (Absolute)""
(Santiparva 251/7).
'Etairvimohayatyesa jiianamavrtya dehinam'—It is because of
desire, that a man does what he ought not do, and does not
do what he ought to do. Thus the embodied soul is deluded,
by desire.
In the second chapter, the Lord declared—From desire
"
461,"420 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 =
springs anger’ (2/62) and ‘From anger arises delusion’ (2/63).
It means, that if anyone becomes an obstacle to the satisfaction
of a desire, anger arises. But if the desire is satisfied, it gives
birth to greed, and from greed arises deluston. Desire is, an :
evolute of the mode of passion, while delusion, is an evolute |
of the mode of ignorance.The mode of passion and the mode
of ignorance, are not far from each other.* Desire, deludes the
embodied soul, through senses, mind and intellect. The desire, -
which is an evolute of the mode of passion, is transformed
into delusion, which is an evolute of ignorance. _
A man has a desire to enjoy sense-objects (sensual pleasures).
Firstly, he does not get those desired sense-objects. However,
if he gets them, they do not stay. In spite of it, he desires
to get them somehow or the other, and thinks of so many
devices to obtain them. Therefore, first desire attracts the senses, -
towards objects. Then the senses, attract the mind, while the
senses and the mind attract, the intellect. Thus desire, veiling
wisdom, through the senses, mind and intellect, deludes the
embodied soul and drives it to ruin. -
It is a rule that if a master terminates the service of a
sincere servant, he is not likely to get such a sincere servant
again. Similarly, if a servant does not carry out the order of |
a virtuous master and does not serve him, he will not get an
opportunity to work under such good masters. In the same
way, if a person by misusing the human body, instead of .
realizing God, wastes it in hankering after worldly pleasures,
and prosperity, he will not get this human life again. It is,
because of the impurity of mind, that a man rejects good
things; and the mind is tainted by, desire. Therefore, first of
all, a striver should renounce desire.
* Among the modes of ignorance, passion and goodness the ratio of the
distance is 1:10:100. It means that modes of ignorance and passion are near each
other, while the mode of goodness is far-away from them.
"
462,"Verse 41] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 421
'Dehinam vimohayati'—It means that, desire deludes only
the embodied soul i.e., the soul which has identified itself with
the body, and has accepted the relationship of 'mine' with it. |
The Lord, at the beginning of His gospel, explained that the :
soul is different from the body (Gita 2/11—30). This is also
everyone's experience. The desire covering wisdom, deludes
the embodied soul (the soul which accepts its affinity for the _
body), but not the pure soul. A man (the soul) assuming the
body as ‘I ', ‘mine’ and for 'me', attaches importance to the -
perishable objects and gets attached to them, which, creates
affinity for them. This affinity gives birth to desire. Desire,
having deluded the man (embodied soul), leads him to
worldly bondage.
IOI -
Link:—The Lord, in the next verse, tells Arjuna the device
of eliminating this enemy te., desire, and directs him to -
kill it.

Therefore, O best of Bharatas (Arjuna), first control the senses
then, kill, this sinful destroyer, of wisdom and realization. 41
Comment:— |
‘Tasmattvamindriyanyadau niyamya bharatarsabha'— Senses,
are said to be controlled, when they do not enjoy the sense-
objects, but are used in order to maintain the body or to attain
a spiritual goal. It means, that they should neither have an
aversion to disagreeable action, nor an attachment for agreeable
action (Gita 18/10). Actions performed with attachment and |
aversion, strengthen attachment and aversion and these drive
"
463,"422 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3 |
a man to ruin.. Therefore, let the scriptures be the authority

for determining what should be done and what should not

be done (Gita 16/24).Thus, by following scriptural injunction,
pertaining to the performance of prescribed actions, and non- |
performance of forbidden actions. senses are controlled.

So long as, a man is swayed by his senses, he cannot
have an eye on the goal of life. Without having an eye on the 7
goal of life i.e., without attaining it, desire cannot be totally
killed. So, first the Lord urges to control the senses, in order to -
kill desire. |

First, the senses get entangled in their objects, by which
desire for those objects is born. When a man performs actions
with desire, he comes under the full sway of senses and has
a downfall. But, he who performs his duty, by controlling the ~
senses, without expecting any fruit, quickly attains salvation.

'Enam jianavijnananasanam'—The term ‘Jnana’ also stands
for the knowledge of the scriptures (Gita 18/42). But in this |
context the term, stands for discrimination (what should be done -
and what should not be done). The term, 'vijnana’ stands for
Self-realization. |

Discrimination and Self-realization—both are axiomatic.

All the people have not realized the self, but discrimination

has been bestowed upon them. The term 'Anicchannapi', used

by Arjuna, in the thirty-sixth verse of this chapter, also proves |
that every human being possesses this faculty of discrimination.

It is by discrimination that he knows, what is virtue and what

is vice (sin). So, it is by discrimination that he does not want

to commit a sin. But, when discrimination is veiled by desire,

he commits sin without thinking of the consequences. When
discrimination is aroused, he performs actions, having thought
of the consequences.

Thus, desire veils discrimination, as well as Self-realization
"
464,"Verse 41] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 423 .
1.e., it does not let these reveal themselves. So it has been
called, the sinful destroyer. In fact it does not destroy them,
but it hides them. This 'Veiling' has been called destroying, ;
here Discrimination and Self-realization, are never destroyed,
while desire is destroyed. If clouds appear before the eyes, |
it is said that the sun has been covered by clouds. But in
fact, the sun is not covered, it is the eyes which are covered. -
Similarly, when it is said that desire has veiled discrimination
and Self-realization, it means that these are not veiled, but it
is the intellect which is concealed. -

'‘Papmanam hi prajahi'—Destre, is the root of all sins. Having
veiled discrimination, it makes a man blind. So he cannot recognize
the distinction between virtues and sins, and thus indulges in
sins, which lead him to ruin. So the Lord orders to slay desire -
by declaring it sinful.

A man wants to lead a lonely life of an ascetic, by _
renouncing household affairs but he does not renounce desire; he :
does not even think of renouncing it. If desires are renounced,
everything will be set right automatically. When a man dies ;
with unfulfilled desires, these lead him to the next birth. It
means, that desires lead him to the bondage of birth and
death. Thus, desires do nothing, except binding him.

When a man is attracted towards worldly objects, desire is
born. This desire veils discrimination and he indulges in sense-
pleasure. The pleasure of birds and beasts, is confined to the joy
born of the contact of senses, with objects. But, a man desires
objects and money and indulges in hoarding money. In order to
hoard money, he adopts foul means such as falsehood, fraud, thefts
and robberies etc. Moreover, he becomes proud of himself. This
pride is a demoniac trait. Thus, he is totally damned, Therefore
the Lord orders Arjuna, to slay sinful desire.

It is said that the senses are superior to the gross body,

Comment:— |
‘Indriyani paranyahuh'—Senses are superior to body or -
objects of senses. It means, that senses know the objects
but objects do not know senses. Senses live without objects,
but without senses, the existence of objects is not proved.
Objects cannot illumine senses, but senses illumine objects.
Senses remain the same while objects go on changing objects
come within the range of senses, while senses do not come
within the range of objects. Eyes (senses) can perceive the
physical body and objects, but the body and objects cannot
perceive the senses. So senses are greater, more powerful,
more subtle and have a wider range of activity, than objects
and the physical body.
‘Indriyebhyah pararn manah'— Senses, do not know the
mind, while the mind knows all the senses. Every sense,
knows only its own objects, but does not know the objects
"
466,"Verse 42-43] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 425 |
of other senses. Ears can perceive only sound, but cannot
perceive touch, form, taste and smell. Similarly, tongue can

only taste, nose can only smell, eyes can only see, and skin |
can only touch. But the mind knows the five senses, and
their objects. Therefore, the mind is superior, more powerful, |
more subtle, has a wider range of activity, than senses and ~

is, their illuminator. | ;

‘Manasastu para buddhih'—The mind, does not know the
intellect, but the intellect knows the mind and senses. The -
intellect, knows whether the mind is quiet or turbulent and whether
senses function properly or not. It means, that the intellect
knows the mind and its thoughts, as well as the senses and
their objects. Therefore, the intellect is greater, more powerful,
more subtle and has a wider range of activity, than the mind -
and is its illuminator.

""Yah buddheh paratastu sah'—The master of intellect is _
ego; therefore, a person says 'My intellect’. Intellect is an
instrument and ‘ego’ is the doer. The instrument depends,
on the doer. Desire, resides in the insentient portion of ego. :
But, it is because of the identification of the self with the
insentient body etc., that desire seems to reside, in the pure |
self (the sentient).

In fact, desire resides in ‘ego’ ‘I’, because ego has the
desire to enjoy pleasures and so becomes the enjoyer. The
enjoyer, enjoyment and the object to be enjoyed, belong to
the same _ class, otherwise the enjoyer cannot be attracted
towards the objects. But, there is no desire in the self, which
is the illuminator of the enjoyer, enjoyment and the object to
be enjoyed. All the insentient objects, such as the body, the
mind, the senses, the intellect and the ego are fragments of
nature (prakrti). Beyond ego there is the self, a fragment of
God. The self, is the base, the root, the cause, the inspirer
"
467,"426 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA (Chapter 3
of the body, senses, mind, intellect and ego, and is subtler,
greater, stronger, wider than all of them, and is also their
illuminator. |
There is pleasure or pain in the insentient nature (prakrti) of ,
the embodied soul, while the sentient (soul) does not undergo .
any modifications, such as pleasure or pain etc. The self (soul)
is the knower of any modification. But, when It identifies _
Itself with the insentient (body etc.,) it has to undergo pleasure
and pain. The sentient, (soul) by identifying Itself with the
insentient (body etc.,) becomes the enjoyer. In the inert only, -
there is no enjoyership. The enjoyership, remains in the ego
(where there is identification of the soul with the body). The
term ‘asya’, used in the fifty-ninth verse of the second chapter,
denotes the enjoyer, while the term ‘Parama’ denotes, God, ~
unattached Universal Soul. ""When a striver realizes, ‘Parama’
(God or Self) his taste or relish, also turns away (Gita 2/59).
A man, has desire in order to derive pleasure or joy, while the -
self is, naturally, a heap of joy. Therefore, on God-realization
or Self-realization, desire (desire for sensual pleasure) totally ~
perishes, forever.
The physical (gross) body, is the object of senses,
senses are the external instruments, while mind and intellect,
are the internal instruments. Senses are beyond, (superior,
stronger, wider, subtler and illuminator) the physical body,
while intellect is, body and senses. Ego which is the doer,
is beyond intellect and desire resides, in the ego. The self
is sentient, unaltered (uniform) and an embodiment of truth,
consciousness, and bliss consolidated. But when It identifies
Itself with the insentient body etc., ego is born and the self,
becomes the doer or agent. Thus the doer (agent) has two
aspects—the insentient one and the sentient one. A man (the
"
468,"Verse 42-43] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 427
embodied soul), because of the insentient aspect, is attracted
towards the world ie., the worldly desires are born, while
because of the sentient aspect, he is attracted towards God or |
the spiritual discipline.* As the insentient aspect is perishable, .
so are the worldly desires, and as the sentient aspect, is eternal,
so are the spiritual desires (needs). The mundane desires, are
renounced, while the spiritual ones (of the renunciation of the -
world, of Self-realization, of devotion to God), are satisfied.
The mundane desires can appear, but cannot exist, while the
spiritual desires-can be suppressed but cannot perish, because -
the former are unreal while the latter are real. Therefore, a
striver should neither hope for the fulfilment of the mundane
desires, nor lose heart by thinking of the non-fulfilment of
spiritual desires. 7
In fact, the only desire of a man (the soul) is to realize
God, Whose fragment he is. But by identifying himself with
the body etc., he, by an error of judgment, forgets the real 7
desire, and hankers after worldly pleasures and prosperity. But,
the real never ceases to be. The desire for the real can never -
be destroyed. In a striver two sorts of desire remain—one for
God-realization and the other, for worldly pleasures. So, there is
a duel between the two. It 1s because of the duel, that when a
striver practises spiritual discipline such as adoration, meditation .
and good company etc., his spiritual desires are aroused, but at
* The identification of the self with the body etc., can be explained by
an illustration. A block of iron with four edges has no burning power but when
by coming into contact with fire it identifies itself with fire, it develops the
burning power and fire, in spite of having no edges, becomes of four edges.
But a magnet attracts only iron, not fire because iron and magnet belong
to the same class and the fire automatically calms down. In the same way
when there is_ identification of the self with the body, the sentient portion
is attracted towards God, while the insentient towards the world. When the
sentient portion is attracted towards God the insentient is left because it is
perishable. But when the insentient portion is attracted towards the world, the
sentient One remains because it is eternal.
"
469,"428 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 3 /
other times he hankers after worldly pleasures and prosperity.
While having mundane desire, a striver cannot even resolve,
that he has to practise spiritual discipline. He cannot progress ;
in the spiritual path, so long as spiritual desire, is not aroused. .
When he resolves, that he has only to realize God, the duel
ceases and only the keen spiritual desire remains, which enables
him to realize God easily (Gita 5/3). So, for a striver it is -
indispensable to root out this duel, between mundane desire
and the spiritual one. -

The self, has an automatic attraction or inclination, towards

God whose fragment It is. This attraction is known, as devotion.

When the Self accepts Its affinity for the world, that devotion,

is suppressed and desire springs. So long as there is desire,
devotion (iove) is not, aroused. Without devotion, desire is not -
killed. The insentient fragment, hankers after sensual pleasures,

while the sentient one, is attracted towards God. Therefore, /
in fact, desire resides in the insentient fragment, but it is

so because the two are identified. When the sentient (self)

does not accept Its affinity for the insentient, desire perishes. ;
It means, that as soon as, the sentient (Self), renounces Its
affinity for the insentient (body etc.,) Ego’ (the identification |
of the self with the insentient) perishes and consequently,

desire perishes.

Desire abides, in the insentient fragment of ego. The
reason is, that an enjoyer can be attracted towards objects of
enjoyment of the world, (the world which is seen), the senses

and intellect:with which the world is seen, only if these belong
to the same class, because attraction is possible for the objects
of the same class only. As eyes are, attracted to the beautiful
colour or form, so is the case with other senses. Intellect is
attracted towards discrimination or thought, not to sound etc.
If it is attracted, it is, because of its association with senses. ,
"
470,"Verse 42-43] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 429 |
Similarly, the self has Its identity with God, and so It is attracted
towards God. This identity, can be realized only when the Self
totally renounces, Its affinity for the insentient (Matter). As
soon as, this identity is realized, devotion (Love) is aroused,
in which there is total lack of matter (the unreal).
The insentient fragment, ‘causal body’, is a very subtle
fragment of the cosmic intelligence, which is an evolute of
nature. Desire, resides in this causal body. It is because of the ~
identification of the self with the causal body, that desire seems
to reside in the self. When there is no identification, a man ~
realizes the self which is pure and uniform. In that case, desire
perishes totally.
'Evam buddheh param buddhva'—In the previous verses,
it has been explained, ""The senses are greater than the body, _
greater than the senses, is the mind and greater than the mind
is the intellect."" But now in this verse, when the Lord declares,
that greater than intellect, is desire, He means to say, that desire -
resides in ‘ego', not in the self. Had it resided in the self, it
' might have never perished. It is born, when the self accepts -
its affinity for the insentient body etc. In fact, it resides in the
insentient fragment, (matter), but appears in the Self. Therefore,
knowing. this desire, which is beyond intellect, a striver should
eliminate it.
‘Samstabhyaétmanamatmana'— The method, to slay this desire,
is to restrain, the self by the self viz., to accept the real affinity
of the self, for the pure self or for God whose fragment It is.
The same fact, has been pointed out by the Lord, in the fifth
and the sixth verses of the sixth chapter when he declares, ""One
Should raise oneself by one's self alone"" and ""The self has been
conquered by the self.”
The self is a fragment of God, while the body, senses, mind
and intellect are fragments of the world. When the self having a |
"
471,"430 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
disinclination for God, has an inclination to nature (the world),
. desires are born, Desires are bom, when there is privation and
a man (the self) feels it, because of his affinity for the world,
because the world is unreal, has no existence (Gita 2/16) but
like a mirage, it seems to exist. As soon as, the affinity for
the world is renounced, desires perish, because the self has no
deficiency as the Lord declares, ""The real never suffers any
deficiency"" (Gita 2/16). -
Even when, a man has disinclination for God, and
assumes his affinity for the world, his real desire (need or
hunger) remains to realize God, whose, fragment he (the self)
is. He wants to remain alive forever, he wants to possess
all knowledge and he wants to be happy forever—this is
his desire to attain God, who is the Embodiment of Truth, _
Consciousness and Bliss. But, it is because of his affinity for
the world, that by an error of judgment, he wants to satisfy
this desire (need), by enjoying worldly pleasures. But this _
desire, can never be satisfied with worldly objects, so it will
have to be discarded. | ~
He, who has established his affinity, for the world, is also
capable of renouncing it. So the Lord orders Arjuna, to slay
this desire by dissociating himself from the world, through his
own efforts.
This dissociation, needs no practice because practice is done
with the help of the world (body, senses, mind and intellect).
In fact, a man gets established in the self or realizes God,
by renouncing affinity for the world.
When the self accepts Its affinity, for the world, it has a
desire to enjoy worldly pleasures, as well as, to realize God.
He (the self) by an error wants to satisfy the need for God-
"
472,"Verse 42-43] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 431
realization (who is Truth, Consciousness and Bliss) by worldly
materials. Therefore, both his desires, remain unfulfilled.

A man can know the world, by dissociating himself from :
it, and the Lord, by identifying himself with Him, because he
(the self) is different from the world, while he has identity
with God. But he accepts his identity or affinity, for the world,
in order to acquire worldly things, which is never possible. ~
Similarly, he accepts that he is different from God which
is also not a reality. Spiritual desire, is necessary, in order -
to root out worldly desires. When spiritual desires grow up
mundane desires, automatically, perish. When mundane desires,
are rooted out, spiritual desire is satisfied viz., God, Who 1s
ever attainable, is attained.* God always pervades everywhere, -
but a man does not realize Him, because of his entanglement
with worldly desires. .

_ ‘Jahi Satrurh mahabaho kamaritpam durasadam'—The term 7
""Mahabaho’ means, one possessed of long and mighty arms Le.,
a brave warrior. By addressing Arjuna, as 'mahabaho’, the Lord -
means that he is brave enough to slay the enemy, in the form
of desire.

It is hard for a man to conquer this enemy, so long as |
he has affinity for the world. This desire, deviates even the
wise from the performance of their duty, by covering their
discrimination, and so they have a downfall. Therefore, the |
Lord has said, that it is hard to conquer. So, a striver, instead
of losing heart, should be aware of this enemy.

Desires appear and disappear, whether these are fully

* When all the desires of a striver are rooted out, the mortal man
becomes immortal and he very well realizes the Eternal"" (Kathopanisad 2/3/14;
Brhadaranyaka 4/4/7).

""O Lotus eyed! when a man renounces all his desires he attains God-
realization” (Srimadbhagavata 7/10/9).
"
473,"432, $RIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
satisfied or partly satisfied, or not satisfied at all, while the
self ever remains uniform, and knows their appearance and
disappearance. So he can easily renounce his affinity for
them, which is merely assumed. Therefore, a striver should
not be afraid of desire, if he is determined* to attain his
aim, he can slay ‘desire’, very easily.
Everyone is independent, qualified, deserving and able
to realize God, but it is not so with desire, because these
can never be satiated. The Lord, has bestowed upon beings
this human body, so that they may attain Him. So they can |
easily renounce desires, but it is because of their attachment
to the worldly persons and objects etc., that it seems difficult
to renounce desires. |

The Lord, creates unfavourable circumstances, so that ~
man may be warned, not to have desire for favourable
circumstances, otherwise these will lead him to suffering. It _
is a rule that he who has a desire for worldly persons and
objects, cannot escape pain. The Lord declares, ""The pleasures ;
that are born of contacts (with objects) are only sources, of
pain (Gita 5/22).

The soul possesses infinite strength. It is because of the ,

power derived from the soul, that intellect, mind and senses,

seem powerful. But It forgets Its strength because of Its affinity
for the insentient, and regards itself as subordinate to the |
intellect, mind and senses etc. Therefore, it is necessary to
know ‘the Self, and recognize Its power, in order to kill the
enemy in the form of desire.

*A man's only aim is to attain the imperishable Lord, not the perishable
world. He has a desire to acquire the perishable objects. Aim remains the same
constantly while desire change. Aim is realized while desires may or may not be
satisfied but they disappear. A man wants to realize his aim (God) even though
his body may be broken into pieces.
"
474,"Verse 42-43] SADHAKA-SANJIVANT | 433 .
Desire, is born out of affinity of the self, for the insentient
(Matter) and it resides in it, but seems to reside in the self.
If one does not accept affinity for the insentient, desire has |
no existence. Therefore, when the Lord urges Arjuna, to slay.
desire, He means to say, that desire has no existence of
its own. A desire appears and it automatically disappears.
So, if one has no new desires, the old ones automatically ;
disappear. : |
A man becomes aware of something wanting in himself, _
only when he regards the worldly objects, such as the body
etc., as ‘I’, 'mine’ and ‘for me', but he wants to make up for
the lack, by worldly materials. So, he has desire to acquire
these. But it is impossible to make up that lack, by those
materials because he (the self) is imperishable, while these -
are perishable. Thus, he by desiring transitory objects, gains
nothing, but suffering. Therefore, by calling desire an enemy, -
the Lord urges Arjuna to slay it.
This desire can be easily eliminated through the Discipline
of Action, because a striver following the Discipline of :
Action, performs every major or minor act, for the good of
others, rather than to satiate his own desire. All his actions
are performed, for the welfare of others without any selfish
motive. All his resources, are not his own, but have been
acquired and are likely to be lost. So, he uses, them, for the |
welfare of the world, by regarding these as the world's,
without any selfish motive. Thus, he gets rid of desires easily,
and consequently, attains his aim of God-realization. Then,
nothing further remains to be done, to be known, and to be
acquired for him.
Appendix—Here the Lord has mentioned senses, mind and
intellect but He has not mentioned ‘ego’. Ego is greater than
intellect. In the fourth verse of the seventh chapter also the
"
475,"434 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter3
Lord has mentioned ego after intellect-—‘bhiimirapo’nalo vayuh
kharh mano buddhireva ca, ahankara itiyarh me .....’. Therefore
here also the term ‘sah’ should be interpreted as ‘desire’ which
abides in ego. | :

Unless and until the self is realized, desire abides in
ego. After Self-realization desire does not persist in ego—
‘param drstva nivartate’ (Gita 2/59). Bliss abides in the self
but a man by according reality and importance to non- -
self wants to derive pleasure from it. As long as there is
affinity for the non-self, desire persists but when affinity ~
for the non-self (inert matter) is renounced, then ‘Prema’

(real love) ensues.

The desire is in the self—‘raso’pyasya’ (Gita 2/59).
Being in the self it is an obstacle to Self-realization. If it is -
not in the self but is in. senses-mind-intellect, how is it an
obstacle to Self-realization by us? It is because of its abode
in the self that the self feels happy and sad and becomes a -
doer and an enjoyer. In fact the desire does not abide in the
self but it is merely an assumption and therefore it can be -
wiped out. Therefore desire is seated in the. self only through
assumption.

A man assumes a thing, which abides in ego, to be abiding
in the self. Ego is identified with the self and desire abides
in that ego. Therefore so long as ego persists, attraction viz.,
‘desire’, which belongs to the same class to which ego belongs, |
persists and when ego perishes, then attraction viz., ‘true love’
belonging to the class of the ‘self’ ensues. In desire there is
attraction for the world while in true love there is attraction
for God.

Ali the three worlds and endless universes are ‘sense-
objects’. Sense-objects are in one region of senses, senses
are in one region of the mind, the mind is in one region of
"
476,"Verse 42-43] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 435 -
the intellect, the intellect is in one region of the ego and the |
ego is in one region of the self. Therefore the self is very
huge within which there are all the three worlds and endless
universes. But a man (the self) by assuming his affinity for -
ego, a fragment of lower (insentient) nature, feels himself
very small (unipresent).

Fourth Chapter | ©
| INTRODUCTION :

The Lord, in the thirty-ninth verse of the second chapter,
said to Arjuna, ""This is the wisdom of Sankhya given to thee, to
attain equanimity, O Arjuna. Now listen; about equanimity to be _
acquired, through the Discipline of Action, in which a person by _
performing action for the welfare of others, without any selfish -
motive, attains equanimity.” Thus according to the context, in
response to Arjuna’s question, Lord Krsna having described the
marks of a man of steady wisdom, completes this topic.

At the beginning of the third chapter, Arjuna asked Lord
Krsna, ""If You think that knowledge is superior to action, why -
do You urge me, to do this savage deed (war)?"" In response
to his question, the Lord, from the fourth to the twenty-ninth
verses, lays emphasis on the performance of actions, by which -
a man attains equanimity. In the thirtieth verse, He says that
surrendering all actions to Him, with a discriminative insight, ”
free from desire and egoism he should perform actions without
mental agitation. In the thirty-first and thirty-second verses, He
declares the sweet fruit of following His preaching (explained |
in the previous verse) and the harm in not following it. In the
thirty-fifth verse, He declares, ""Better is death in one's own
duty.” In the thirty-sixth verse Arjuna asks, ""By what is a man 7
impelled to commit sin?"" The Lord replies, ""It is desire, all
devouring and most sinful, which is the enemy,"" and ordered
Arjuna to slay this enemy.

Though, the Lord's teaching continues from the thirty-
seventh verse, yet in the forty-third verse, when the answer to
Arjuna's question is over, sage Veda Vyasa concludes the third
chapter, and begins the fourth chapter. It shows that the Lord
"
479,"438 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4
having answered Arjuna's question, takes a pause and then starts
again, the Discipline of Action, which was being described in

the forty-seventh and forty-eighth verses of the second chapter,

by the term ‘Imam’ (This) in the first verse of the fourth chapter. _ -
Therefore, the fourth chapter is regarded, as an appendix to the
third chapter. |

There are two important factors pertaining to the Discipline
of Action—(1) Performance of actions and, (2) special knowledge -
about action. Arjuna wants to renounce the performance of action,
so he says to Lord Krsna, ""Why do You ask me to be engaged __
in this savage deed?"" Therefore, the Lord, lays special emphasis
on the performance of duty, specially in the third chapter, while
in the fourth chapter, He imparts knowledge about actions. He
declares, ""I shall teach thee such action, (the nature of action
and inaction), after knowing which, thou shalt be liberated from = ~—
evil (the wheel of birth and death) (4/16).

This Karmayoga, in spite of being without beginning, was |
lost to the world through, a long lapse of time, because of the
absence of scholarly teachers (sages), who could impart it. The
Lord, in the first three verses, describing how Karmayoga was. |
handed down from ancient times, proves how it existed from
times immemorial.

imam vivasvate yogam proktavanahamavyayam
vivasvanmanave praha  manuriksvakave'bravit
The Blessed Lord said: : |

I taught this imperishable Yoga to Vivasvan (the sun-god); who

expounded it to Manu, and Manu proclaimed it to Iksvaku. 1
"
480,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 439
Comment:—
""Imam vivasvate yogam proktavanahamavyayam'—The kings,
such as Surya, Manu and Iksvaku, who have been mentioned by
the Lord, were householders and they attained perfection, through |
the Discipline of Action, leading a householder's life. Therefore,
here the words 'Imam, avyayam yogam’' (this imperishable Yoga)
stand for 'Karmayoga’, (the Discipline of Action).
Though Karmayoga has been described in the Puranas °
(historical records), and Upanisads (philosophical parts of the
Vedas) also, yet it is not as thoroughly detailed, as in the Gita. -
The Lord 1s eternal, His fragment, the soul is also eternal and
so is the affinity of soul for the Lord. Therefore, all the disciplines
(of Action, Knowledge and Devotion) are also eternal.* Here,
the term ‘Avyayam’ shows, that Karmayoga is eternal.
The affinity of the soul for God is eternal. Just as a chaste
wife does not have to make effort to be dear to her husband,
in the like manner, a striver does not have to put in any effort, -
in order to belong to God. But, when he accepts his affinity
for perishable actions, objects and incidents etc., he does not
realize his eternal affinity for God. Therefore, a Karmayogi, in
order to, renounce his assumed affinity for the world, utilizes his
body, senses, mind and intellect etc., for rendering service to the
world, by regarding them as the world's. He thinks, that just as
the smallest particle of dust, is a fragment of the huge earth, so
is the body, a fragment of the vast universe. By accepting this
belief, ‘Karmas' (actions) will be performed, for the world, but |
‘Yoga’ (Nityayoga or eternal union) will be for himself i.e., he
will realize his eternal union with God.
By the terms ‘Vivasvate proktavan’, the Lord wants to
explain to the strivers that as the sun in the solar system while
performing its action by providing heat and light, remains
* Lord Krsna declares in the eighth chapter of the Gita that the bright and
the dark paths of the world are verily thought to be eternal (Gita 8/26).
"
481,"440 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4
unengrossed; similarly, all the strivers should perform actions _
without attachment according to available circumstances, (Gita
3/19). They should, also impart this teaching of Karmayoga, to
others for the public welfare by remaining unengrossed (without ~
desire for fruit, without a sense of 'mine’ and without attachment).

The sun-god, was king at the beginning of creation. Lord
Krsna taught this imperishable Yoga to the sun-god. It means,
that Lord Krsna was the first preceptor in the beginning, and ~
so has Karmayoga come from times immemorial. It seems that
the Lord, tells Arjuna, ""Whatever teaching about 'Karmayoga I -
am imparting to you, is not new but eternal."" |

Question:—Why did the Lord teach this Yoga to the sun-
god, at the beginning of creation?

Answer:—(1) The Lord taught it to him, because He knew __
that he was a deserving candidate.

(2) Such teaching is imparted to the first born, as Brahma,
the creator, who created man and imparted teaching to them —
(Gita 3/10), in order to, inspire them to perform their duty. In the
universe also, the sun-god was the first born, and then the entire -
universe was born of him. The Lord, taught this Yoga, first of all
to the sun-god.* He meant to get it imparted, through the sun-god
to all his progeny, by way of transmission by succession.

(3) The sun, is the eye of entire creation. He imparts
knowledge to all the people and when he rises, they wake up
and are engaged in their work. He sets an example to them for
the performance of their duty. He has been called, the soul of
the entire world}. Therefore, teaching imparted to the sun-god

* In the scriptures the sun-god has been called 'Savita’ which means the
creator. The western scholars also regard the Sun as the creator.

f Inthe Mahabharata it has been said addressing the sun-god, ""O sun-god, you
are the eye of the entire world and the soul of all beings. You are the birth-place
and the inspirer of the good conduct of the followers of the path of action.""

""You are the abode which should be attained by the Sankhyayogis. You
"
482,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 441
will also be communicated to all beings. Therefore, Lord Krsna
first of all, taught this imperishable Yoga to the sun-god.
In fact, this teaching imparted by Lord Krsna (the manager
of the world-theatre), to the sun-god, is a drama staged by Him, |
for the welfare of the world. As Lord Krsna taught Arjuna, the
incarnation of Nara, the wise sage, for the welfare of the world,
so did He teach, this Yoga to the sun-god, the embodiment of
knowledge, for the welfare of the entire wotld. This Yoga has 7
done a lot of good to the world, is doing and will continue to
do, in future also. -
'Vivasvanmanave praha manuriksvakave'bravit'— Karmayoga,
is the main course of action for householders. Out of celibacy,
household life, the retired and the renounced, orders—the
four stages (orders) of life—household life is most important, -
because it is a householder that provides for the other stages of
_ life. A householder, by performing his duty, can easily realize
God. He need not change the order of life. Lord Krsna in -
mentioning the names of the kings, such as the sun-god, Manu
and Iksvaku, wants to say, that at the beginning of creation, -
they as householders, having slain desires, realized God. Lord
Krsna and Arjuna were also householders. Therefore, Lord Krsna -
through Arjuna, teaches all householders that they can realize
God, as householders, without leading a secluded life as ascetics
by performing their duty.
In spite of being a householder, Arjuna thinks that it is
better to live, in this world even by begging than to perform
a savage deed, of slaying honoured teachers in war (Gita 2/5)
viz., he thinks that the renounced order of life is superior to
the household life. Therefore, the Lord says to him that he is a
are the base of Karmayogis. You are the free gateway to salvation and you are
the refuge for the salvation-seekers. You hold the entire world. This world is
illumined by you. You sanctify it and it is preserved by you without any selfish
motive (Vanaparva 3/36—38).
"
483,"442 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4

noble householder of the royal family. So performance of actions _

will lead him to salvation, in the same way, as renunciation leads

an ascetic to salvation. Karmayoga, consists in the utilization

of available circumstances. So Karmayoga (the Discipline of —

Action), can be followed by people of every caste, creed, country

and ofder of life.

- The Lord, has mentioned the names of noble and influential
kings of the past, so that people may draw inspiration from them, —~

| in order to perform their duty. ,
.

Attachment (affinity) for actions and objects, is a stumbling
block to Karmayoga. When a householder renounces pleasure,
his zest also comes to an end. When a person starts enjoying
pleasure, such as eating a sweet dish, he relishes it very much. -
But, as he goes on eating it, the taste diminishes and finally,
it ceases. But, he commits an error, as he does not make that _
distaste permanent, by attaching importance to it. He regards this
distaste as satisfaction, (reward). But the fact is, that is the state
of deficiency in which he has no power of having pleasure. :

The interest or desire which diminishes or perishes, cannot
be the characteristic of the self and therefore, It (the self) has no
real affinity for the objects etc., which he desires or wants. Our
teal affinity is, for God and therefore, devotion while following
a spiritual path for God-realization, 1s ever enhanced. Even when,
he realizes God, his devotion increases continuously, and it is
transformed into love (devotion). The self, is also real, so no
one has a desire in the least for one's own negation.

When actions, instruments (body, senses and mind etc.,)
objects and materials, are perishable how can these bear
imperishable fruit? How can pleasure and satisfaction, be derived
from the fruit of. perishable things to match the pleasure and
satisfaction, achieved on God-realization? Therefore, astriverhas
"
484,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 443 :
to renounce his affinity for actions, instruments (such as body,
senses and mind etc.,) and objects. He can renounce this affinity,
only when he does nothing for himself, wants nothing for himself
and regards nothing as his own. But he utilizes everything, by |
regarding it as of the world in rendering service, to the world.
A Karmayogi, performs actions scrupulously and lovingly,
without desire, attachment and feeling of ‘mine’. Desire, attachment
and a sense of ‘mine’ pollute actions, while careful and loving .
nature, purifies these. When actions are performed with desire,
attachment and a sense of mine, objects are destroyed, and man _
has a downfall. The thought of actions come to the mind, time
and again i.e., affinity for those actions continues. But when
actions are performed scrupulously, devotedly and lovingly, there
is proper use of objects, and man is elevated and the thought of
actions do not come to mind i.e., affinity for these is renounced. -
As soon as, this affinity for actions is totally renounced, a striver
realizes the self or God, who is ever present and existent.
Everyone, can easily assume that whatever he possesses 1s
not his own, but is acquired, just as he has acquired the body
from parents, education and knowledge from preceptors and so -
on. It means that every man, even the richest one, has to depend
on others, in one way or the other. So, it is his duty to render
service to others, with all his possessions, because he has acquired |
them from others. This, is known as Karmayoga, no one is
dependent and unable to follow it and for its practice.
In fact, duty is that which can be performed easily, which |
must be performed and by performing which a man certainly
attains his aim. A man is not responsible for the performance of
action, which he cannot perform. And, what is forbidden, must
not be done. When a person does not perform forbidden actions,
he either does nothing or he performs only prescribed actions.
Duty is always performed, for the welfare of others, without
expecting any reward. Actions, with the expectation of reward,
"
485,"444 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4
should not be performed, because these lead to bondage. But, it
_ does not mean that actions are performed, without any aim. An
act without any aim, cannot be performed by anyone, except by
insane person. There is a vast difference, between fruit (reward)
and aim. Reward, is perishable while aim is eternal. A man's’.
aim is to attain God who is ever attainable, and for which this
human life has been bestowed upon him. He cannot realize
God, without performing his duty, in a disinterested manner. _
He cannot perform his duty, so long as he indulges, in reward
for actions, heedlessness and indolence etc. |
In fact, performance of duty needs no effort, it is performed
automatically. But when a man performs action for himself with
egoism, attachment, desire and a sense of 'mine’, it involves
effort. Therefore, the Lord declares, ""Action which involves strain
(effort), is said to be of the nature of passion"" (Gita 18/24). -
As the Lord, is ever engaged in the welfare of all beings, so
is His power. As a news broadcast by a particular radio station, _
_ 1s received on the same frequency by radio-sets, similarly, when
a Karmayogi performs all his actions for the welfare of the
world without any selfish motive, his power, is identified with —~
the all-pervading, benevolent power of God and his actions
become uncommon. Thus, because of Lord's power, his actions
are conducive to the welfare of the world. Therefore, there is
_ heither any obstacle in the way of performing his duty nor does
| it involve any strain.
- A man, can perform his duty without depending on any _
| person or circumstance. According to Karmayoga (the Discipline of
Action), giving help to others according to their need, is service.
When the engine of a car goes out of order and the driver is
trying to push it forward, if someone helped him, it is service.
But,. he who looks for service, does not render real service,
but he performs actions, only because by doing so, his aim is
mundane rather than spiritual. Service 1s rendered according to
"
486,"Verse 2] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 445
available circumstances. Therefore, a Karmayogi neither changes
circumstances nor does he seek these but utilizes these. The
utilization of the available circumstances, is Karmayoga.

This Yoga handed down thus, in regular succession, came to
- the royal sages. But through long lapse of time, it was lost to the
world, O oppressor of the foes (Arjuna). 2
Comment:—
""Evarh paramparapraptamimam rajarsayo viduh'— The kings,
such as the sun-god, Manu and Iksvaku, learnt the Karmayoga,
followed it and also, inspired their subjects to follow it. Thus, -
it was handed down in regular succession to the families of |
the royal sages. This Karmayoga is a special lare of the kings -
(the warrior class). Therefore, every member of the warrior class
should know it. Similarly, the heads and leaders of a family,
society, village and town etc., must also know it. |
In ancient days, the kings who knew Karmayoga, administered
the affairs of state smoothly, without being attached to royal
pleasures. They had a natural inclination for the welfare of the
subjects. The great Sarhskrta poet Kalidasa writes about the kings
of solar dynasty:—
""Those kings levied a tax on their subjects in the same way,
as the sun sucks water from the earth, in order to supply it to
the earth in the form of rain, a thousand times more."" |
It means, that the tax realized from the subjects by kings,
was all used for public welfare. In order to, provide for their
household expenses, they followed occupations, like farming.
"
487,"446 : SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 4 |
By practising Karmayoga, they were automatically endowed with,
singular knowledge and devotion. Therefore, even great sages
went to those kings, in order to learn wisdom. Sri Vedavyasa's
son named Sukadeva, went to king Janaka, in order to gain
wisdom from him. In the fifth chapter of the Chandogyopanisad
it is mentioned, that six sages together went to king Asvapati,
in order to learn knowledge of Brahma, the Supreme.* Having
mentioned kings, such as Janaka and others in the twentieth verse ~
of the third chapter, and the sun-god, Manu and Iksvaku etc.,
here, as Karmayogis, Lord Krsna wants to urge Arjuna that he -
should also perform actions accordingly (follow Karmayoga) as the
ancestors did, in former times, as he was also a householder and
a member of the warrior class (Gita 4/15). Moreover, it was very
easy for him to learn it, because he belonged to the warrior class.

'Sa kaleneha mahata yogo nastah'— God is eternal and the -
means—Karmayoga, Jnanayoga and Bhaktiyoga (Disciplines of
Action, Knowledge and Devotion) etc., are also eternal, as they -
have been laid down by God. Therefore, they never cease to be.

The Lord declares, ""The real, never ceases to be"" (Gita 2/16).

The yogas are eternal, even if these are not practised. Therefore, ;
here the term ‘Nastah' means, passing out of sight, rather than

out of existence.

In the first verse of this chapter, this Yoga has been called

imperishable. Therefore, if this term 'Nastah' is taken as ‘out
of existence’ there will be a contradiction between the two
statements. Moreover, the Lord again in the third verse declares, |
that He is going to reveal the same ancient Yoga, to Arjuna.
It means that the religious texts and the learned sages who
possessed knowledge of this Yoga, and practised it, had more
or less disappeared from the earth.

* King ASsvapati declares, ""In my kingdom there is neither a thief, nor a

' miser, nor a drunkard, nor one who does not offer oblation to the consecrated
fire, nor an ignorant person nor an adulterer; then how can there be a prostitute”
(Chandogyopanisad 5/1 1/5)?
"
488,"Verse 2] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 447
The Lord declares, that it was through a long lapse of time, |
that it disappeared, because at the beginning of creation, the Lord
taught it to the sun-god, then it was handed down in regular
succession and the royal sages come to know it. But due to the ~
absence of great spiritual souls, possessed of the knowledge of
this Yoga, it could not be handed down. So, at present only a
few people know and talk about it. |
Though this doctrine was not practised, yet it did not cease -
to be, because without selflessness, which is the essence of
Karmayoga even other disciplines (such as of knowledge and _
devotion) cannot be constantly practised. A Jnanayogi through
discrimination, by regarding actions as 'Asat' (unreal), renounces
his affinity for these, while a Bhaktiyogi renounces affinity for
them by surrendering these to God. No affinity, howsoever, is to
be maintained. This is the doctrine of 'Karmayoga’'. Therefore, a -
Jnanayogi and a Bhaktiyogi will have to adopt the principles of
""Karmayoga’, even though they may not practise it. It means, that
at present, though it has been lost, yet as a doctrine it exists. -
The fact is, that in Karmayoga, Karma (actions) have not
disappeared but 'Yoga' (selflessness) has disappeared, because a -
man performs actions with a selfish motive. It means, that strivers
have a firm belief that they will attain God, through actions in
the same way as they acquire worldly things through actions.
But they forget the reality, that God is, ever attained. Actions,
are performed for the world while ""Yoga'’ (union with God) is,
ever for one's own self. Yoga is not attained through actions, as
is self-evident.* Therefore, the generality of the assumption that
* Yoga is attained by performing one's duty for the welfare of the world
without any selfish motive. Action is performed in order to attain the state of
actionlessness— Action is said to be the means to attain to Yoga’ (Gita 6/3). When
actions are performed with a selfish motive, the impetus for actions is enhanced.
But when they are performed for the welfare of others the impetus for actions
perishes. It means that nothing remains to be done by doing for others while
actions are continuously performed when one does for himself. When nothing
remains to be done, the striver realizes his union (which is self-evident) with God. .
"
489,"448 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4 :
this Yoga can be attained through action, has practically caused |
the disappearance of yoga.
This human body, has been bestowed upon us, so that we
may practise Karmayoga i.e., serve others without any selfish |
motive. But,. we are so much absorbed in hankering after |
pleasures, prosperity and honour etc., that we do not pay heed
to it. Thus, this knowledge has been lost, because we have
forgotten it. -
A man by rendering service can control not only birds, beasts
and persons but also the gods, manes, sages, saints and even -
God. But having forgotten this practice, he has been overpowered
by pleasures, which lead to hell and eighty-four lac forms of
lives. This is called concealment of Karmayoga.

Comment:— | |
*Bhakto'si me sakha ceti'—Arjuna regarded Lord Krsna, as his
companion (comrade) (Gita 11/41-42) but now he has become .
His pupil (Gita 2/7) 1.e., earlier he was a comrade-devotee, while
now, he has become a disciple-devotee. An order can be given
or a sermon can be preached, only to a disciple rather than to
a friend. The Lord preached His sermon, only when Arjuna
surrendered to Him 1.e., took refuge in Him.
The secret, which is not disclosed even to a comrade, is
revealed to a disciple, who surrenders himself to his preceptor.
"
490,"Verse 3] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI - 449
Arjuna also says to Lord Krsna, ""I am Thy disciple, teach me, .
who have taken refuge in Thee."" Therefore, the Lord reveals
His secret to him.

- It was because of Arjuna’s reverence for Lord Krsna, that |
he, instead of opting for a well-equipped army chose unarmed
Lord Krsna alone, (as his chariot-driver).*

‘Common people, regard the objects bestowed upon them
by God as theirs (while in fact they are not theirs), but they do .
not regard the Lord, (Who is actually theirs), as theirs. They,
instead of having an eye on the glorious Lord, look at His glory. -
Having attached importance to the glory, their intellect becomes
so dull, that they do not even believe, in His existence 1.e., they
do not even look towards Him. Some people adore Him, in
order to gain riches and glory etc. Though riches lie at the feet .
of devotees, yet true devotees do not adore Him for riches, but
they adore Him to attain Him. Those who hanker after riches, are
devotees (slaves) to riches, while those who want to attain God, -
are His real devotees. Arjuna, having abandoned riches or glory
(well-armed Narayani army), chose Lord Krsna. Consequently, :
it was only he, to whom the gospel of the Gita was preached
on the battlefield, though there were other great souls such as
Bhisma, Drona, Yudhisthira etc., near by. Finally Arjuna was
able to regain the kingdom also. _
‘Sa evayam maya te'dya yogah proktah puratanah'—By these

terms, the Lord does not mean to say, that He has given a full |
description of this Yoga, but it means that whatever has been
declared by Him is complete in itself. Further, having answered
Arjuna's question concerning His manifestation (incarnation),
the Lord, again starts the topic of Karmayoga.

_* ""Having heard the words of Lord Krsna Arjuna, the son of Kunti , chose
unarmed Lord Krsna as his helper while he could have chosen the well-armed
Narayani army consisting of 1,09,350 foot soldiers, 65,610 horses, 21,870
chariots and 21,870 elephants"" (Mahabharata, Udyogaparva 7/21).
"
491,"450 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4 -

The Lord declares, that the same Karmayoga, which was
taught to the sun-god at the beginning of the creation, has been
taught to Arjuna. He declares that through long lapse of time,
this Yoga was lost to the world and he also was not manifest. ,
Now he has manifested Himself and has also revealed this Yoga :
again. Therefore, Karmayoga, which has liberated people from
bondage of actions from time immemorial, will also liberate
them today. -

""Rahasyam hyetaduttamam'—As the Lord teaches His supreme
secret to Arjuna, in the sixty-sixth verse of the eighteenth chapter, _
by declaring, ""Take refuge in Me alone; I shall then liberate thee
from all sins."" Here also, He discloses His supreme secret by
declaring, ""I taught this imperishable Yoga to the sun-god at the
beginning of creation and I am preaching the same to you today.""

The Lord seems to say to Arjuna that though He, while -
playing the role of his chariot-driver, is obeying him, yet He is
preaching to him the same Yoga, which was taught to the sun- 7
god at the beginning of creation. He is disclosing this secret to :
him, because He is his devotee and also a loving friend.

Not to talk of a common man, even a striver, pays attention
to the preaching, but he does not pay attention to the preacher.
Having listened to this sermon on Yoga and having studied it,

a striver thinks over it, and he does not take the preacher as the
omnipresent, Lord Krsna Himself. So, the Lord, by using the
term Rahasyam' (secret) introduces Himself and urges a striver
to behold Him, ever.

When the Lord declares that He preached the gospel of
Yoga to the sun-god and is preaching the same to him, He also
means to say, that He is the preacher or the preceptor, of the
entire humanity. As an actor, while playing his role does not
disclose his identity to the audience, but reveals it to his bosom
friend; the Lord also discloses to His devout devotee, His identity.

This is His supreme secret.
"
492,"Verse 3] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 451 |
Karmayoga, can also be regarded as a supreme secret. The
supreme secret is, that actions which bind a man (the soul), may
also liberate him from bondage. If actions are performed with a
selfish motive, by regarding the objects as one's own, these lead
him to bondage. But, if these are performed, without any selfish
motive for the welfare of others, they lead him to liberation
(salvation). This Karmayoga, can be practised independent of all
the circumstances—favourable or unfavourable, riches or poverty,
health or sickness etc. :
While practising Karmayoga there are three important
factors, which need attention— -
(1) The self, is real (imperishable), while all the objects which
are acquired, are unreal (perishable). So, how can the perishable
be possessed by the imperishable? 'So nothing is mine.’
(2) 'I need nothing for myself', because the self lacks -
nothing. Moreover, how can the perishable objects be useful
for the imperishable self? :
(3) ‘Nothing is to be done for the self’. The first reason is,
that the self is a fragment of God, who is sentient, while actions
are insentient. The self is eternal, while actions and their fruits, ”
are transitory. Therefore, when anyone performs actions for the
self, he (the self), is attached to those actions and their fruits.
Actions and their fruits, disappear but attachment for these
continues, which is the cause of his birth and death. The Lord
declares, ""Attachment of the soul to the modes of nature, is the
cause of its births, in good and evil wombs” (Gita 13/21). |
The second reason is, that the responsibility for actions is
his, who can perform these i.e., who possesses the resources to
perform these, and who wants to acquire something or the other.
The self, being actionless, uniform, unchanging and perfect, can
do nothing, without accepting its affinity for the body. Therefore,
the self has nothing to do for itself.
The third reason, is that the self is real and perfect. It
"
493,"452 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4
lacks nothing. The Lord, declares, ""The real, never suffers any ,
deficiency.” (Gita 2/16). When It lacks nothing, there is no
question for It to have any desire, in order to acquire anything.
Therefore, It has to do nothing for Itself. |
In Karmayoga, Karmas (actions) are performed for the world, ,
while ‘Yoga’ (union with God) is for the self. When actions are |
performed for one's own self, one cannot realize one's union with
God. When the full flow of actions is towards the world, we -
realize ‘God, because the body, senses, mind, intellect, objects, .
riches and property etc., whatever we possess, is not different
from the world and is of the world. So, these are to be used
for rendering service, to the world. Therefore, actions are to
be performed for others, in order to renounce affinity for the
world, in the form of objects and actions. This is known as
Karmayoga. By this Karmayoga, the attachment for action, the _
desire to acquire and to live, and the fear of death, perish.

As, for actions performed, in the sunlight, the sun remains
detached, similarly, all action performed in the light of the self, -
the self also remains detached, because the self is sentient and
unchanging, while actions are insentient and changing. But when -
by an error, it accepts Its affinity even in the least, for objects
and actions 1.e., regards them as Its, and for it then those actions
bind It.

As the sun performs its duty always very punctually and
scrupulously, so does a Karmayogi perform his duty efficiently
and promptly. :

If Karmayoga is rightly followed, a Karmayogi, having

the influence of Jiana (Knowledge) attains knowledge, while
with a disposition of devotion, attains devotion, automatically.
By following Karmayoga, a striver does supreme good to the
entire world, whether other people perceive it or not, realize it
or not. He works as a fountain of inspiration for others, and thus
renders service to them.
"
494,"Verse 3] SADHAKA- SANJIVANI 453
The Lord, while beginning the gospel of the Gita, has
described, from the eleventh verse to the thirtieth verse of the
second chapter, that every being experiences or realizes, ‘I am’. °
Even trees and mountains feel this, though these cannot express _
it. This can be clearly seen among beasts and birds, because
they fight with each other, as they notice their own existence; -
otherwise why should they fight? ""I am distinct from the body
and the world""—this is a common experience of every human
being. It is called discrimination. As far as a man is concerned, -
he has been specially endowed with discrimination by God. The
pity is, that he does not respect it and use it appropriately.
Senses, mind and intellect, are the fragments of nature (prakrti)
and so whatever is known, through these, is knowledge born of -
nature. The knowledge of scriptures that is acquired through the
senses, mind and intellect, is also born of nature. The knowledge
of God, is far superior to this knowledge. Therefore, He can be 7
known only by the knowledge of the self. When a man attaches
importance to the knowledge of the self ie., discrimination ~
(wisdom), he develops the power to know ‘Who I am’, 'What is
mine’, ‘What is sentient and what is insentient'’, 'What is God and
what is nature (prakrti)'’, and so on. The same discrimination, is |
applied for Karmayoga also—this is something vital.
In Karmayoga, two important factors predominate—(1) There
is no doubt about one's own existence, 'I am'. (2) Whatever |
objects we possess are not ours, because these are acquired; these
were neither ours in the past, nor will remain ours, in future. 'T
(the self) remains the same while these objects—body, senses,
mind, intellect etc., are changeable and perishable. As actions
appear and disappear, so does their fruit. So actions and objects,
have their affinity for the world, not for the self. When this
discrimination (wisdom) is aroused, desire perishes. When desire
"
495,"454 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4 ;
perishes, self-evident actionlessness, is revealed 1.e., Karmayoga
is accomplished. : :
Discrimination (wisdom) is enveloped by desire (Gita
. 3/38-39). A man cannot discriminate between the right and
the wrong, because he hankers after worldly prosperity and
/ pleasures, in having a selfish motive. Thus, he cannot decide
what ought to be done and what ought not to be done. He wants
to find out a solution, to the riddles of life through the body, _
senses, mind and intellect or by changing the circumstances.
But circumstances cannot be changed by him. So he gets more -
and more entangled, and cannot decide his duty. But, when his
discrimination (wisdom) is aroused, he gets rid of the desire for
pleasure, prosperity and selfishness; and then he clearly sees his
duty, and then ail entanglements perish. |
Actions, bear fruit in the form of outward circumstances, such -
as riches and poverty, praise and blame, honour and dishonour,
fame and defame, profit and loss, birth and death and health
and sickness etc. He who becomes, either happy in favourable ;
circumstances or sad in unfavourable circumstances, by accepting
his affinity for them, is a fool. Why? The reason is, that he -
cannot change the circumstances, but he can rise above these
i.e., can remain detached from them, by making proper use. of
them. In favourable circumstances he should render service to
others, while under unfavourable conditions, he should neither
feel sad nor should he desire favourable circumstance. Such a
striver, easily gets liberated from worldly bondage.
Undesirable circumstances, are fruits of sinful actions. So,
sinful actions which hurt others should not be performed, even
in a dream. But in unfavourable circumstances, which are the
fruits of sinful actions of the past, worry, sadness and fear etc.,
automatically come to his mind, even though he does not commit
new sins. A striver, should not be attached to these. He should
believe that these come to his mind in the same way, as a cow
"
496,"Verse 4] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 455 :
whom he has sold visits his house, because of old habit. As
the cow stops, coming to his house and starts living in the new
place, similarly, when a striver does not get attached to these
feelings, these stop coming to his mind. :
Even when, discrimination (wisdom) is not fully aroused, a oo
Karmayogi has a determinate intellect, and he has to renounce
affinity for the perishable, which is not his and he has to render ;
service to the world without enjoying worldly pleasures. It is |
because of his determinate intellect, that he ceases attaching
importance to worldly pleasures. Then, he cannot be entangled ~
in the mirage of pleasures. Thus his determinate intellect, leads
him to salvation. Good company and the study of the scriptures
strengthen this intellect. Therefore, every striver should have
a firm intellect, that he has to attain salvation. Everyone is _
independent in having this determination, without seeking the
least help, from anyone else.

- ‘Aparam bhavato janma param janma vivasvatah'— Arjuna
asks Lord Krsna, that He was born in the house of Vasudeva
a few years ago, while Vivasvan (the sun-god) was born earlier :
at the beginning of creation. So how could he believe, that He -
had taught this Yoga to the sun-god. |
This question of Arjuna expresses his curiosity, rather than
argument or blame. He wants to hear from Lord Krsna, the
secret of His Divine descent, because only He was capable of
revealing this secret, to him. | -
'Kathametadvijaniyam tvamadau proktavaniti'— Arjuna asks
Lord Krsna, how he should understand that He had taught this -
Yoga at the beginning of creation; because He was born later while
the sun-god had been born earlier at the beginning of creation. As
the Lord had recounted about several generations of the sun-god, .
it proves that He had imparted this knowledge, much earlier.

His omniscience, to manifest His Divine descent.

"
498,"Verse 5] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 457 -
I know them all, but thou knowest not, O scorcher of foes. 5 |
Comment:—
[In the third verse, the Lord said to Arjuna, ""You are My
devotee and My friend."" So Arjuna put to Him a question,
quite frankly and without any hesitation. Arjuna was curious to /
know, the secret of His Divine descent. So the Lord reveals the
secret. When a devotee has curiosity to know some secret, the
saints also reveal it to him.* Saint Tulasidasa also declares in -
the Ramacaritamanasa—""Sages do not conceal a secret, when
they come across, a deserving hand"" (1/110/1).] ee
""Bahiini me vyatitani janmani tava carjuna'—Lord Krsna,
says to Arjuna that both of them have passed many births. But
His manifestation (which will be described in the sixth verse)
is different from his birth, (which will be described in the — _
nineteenth verse of the eighth chapter and the twenty-first and
the twenty-sixth verses of the thirteenth chapter).
In the twelfth verse of the second chapter, the Lord declared, -
""Never was there a time when I was not, or when you or these
kings were not, nor will there ever be, a time hereafter, when :
we all shall cease to be."" It means that God and His fraction,
soul—both are without beginning and eternal.
'Tanyaham veda sarvani'—There are some Yogis (ascetics),
who by practising spiritual discipline possess an intuitional
knowledge, and come to know of their previous births. Such
Yogis, are called “Yunjana yogis’. On the other hand, there are
* The saints remain concealed and don't reveal themselves. But they reveal
themselves in the following three cases.
(i) When a devout devotee having great reverence for those saints, has
curiosity to know them.
(11) When a devout devotee's body is cast off.
(iti) When the saint goes to cast off his body.
In the second and the third cases the saints reveal themselves even to those
devotees who have not so much of reverence for them, but they respect them from
their heart and want to know them.
"
499,"458 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4 -
other Yogis, who naturally know everything of the past births of |
all beings, without practising any spiritual discipline. The Lord

is such a 'Yuktayogi’ Who knows of the beings of the past, the
present and the future (Gita 7/26). Knowledge of God, knows no
bounds of past, present and future and it is constantly present. ~
The Lord in spite of pervading everywhere, everything, every
person, and every circumstances etc., transcends, them all.

[The Lord's statement, ""I know them all"" should thrill strivers -
with delight, because the Lord knows them and has an eye on
them, whatever they are.] | ee

""Na tvam vettha parantapa'—A man does not possess intuitional
knowledge to know of previous births as he is attached to perishable
objects and persons etc. Similar, was the case with Arjuna. He
did not want to fight, because his kith and kin would be killed.

He declared, in the thirty-third verse of the first chapter, ""Those __
for whose sake we desire kingdom, enjoyments and pleasures,
stand here in battle, renouncing their lives and riches."" It shows, _
that Arjuna desired kingdom, enjoyment and pleasure and so he
did not know about his previous births.

Accumulation of materials, such as riches etc., for enjoyment
and pleasure, 1s called 'parigraha’. When a person, totally renounces
this tendency for accumulation, he develops an intuition, which
enables him to know of previous births (Patafyala yogadarSana 2/39).

The world, actions and objects are changing and unreal. So it
naturally suffers deficiency, while the self has no such shortage,
at all. But when he assumes his affinity for the world, he feels
shortcoming in him and wants to make these up, by having desires.

In order to satisfy those desires, he remains absorbed in different

activities day and night but desires are never to be satiated. Due

to desires man acts as if he is unconscious. Not to speak of the

knowledge of several births, he does not even know his duty,

of the present i.e., what he should do and what he is doing.

3. (a) Those who know Him as the Lord of all beings.

Yogamiaya, (the divine potency), these two pertaining to His |
power, and the sixth one, is His manifestation.]

'‘Ajo'pi sannavyayatma'—The Lord, by this expression, explains
that, unlike common men, He is without birth and death. People
take birth and die, but He in spite of being birthless, manifests
Himself, and in spite of being imperishable, conceals Himself. Both
manifestation and concealment, are his unearthly sport (pastimes).

All beings were unmanifest before birth, and will be unmanifest, :
after death, these are manifest only in the middle (Gita 2/28)
while the Lord, ever remains revealed like the sun. As the sun, rs
before rising and after setting, remains the same, but it 1s not seen
by all the beings all the time; so is the case with God Who ever
remains revealed, but seems to be manifested and concealed.

Other beings, have to take birth under the subordination of _
nature (prakrti), according to the actions of the past, while God
manifests Himself of His own accord. Beings, take birth grow,
become old and die, moreover, they have to undergo pleasure -
and pain. But, that is not so in the case of God. He does not
undergo any change. He incarnates Himself, as Lord Rama or -
Krsna etc., displays His sports as a child, and an adolescent and

then continues to be an adolescent with a healthy and handsome
body, without undergoing any change for hundreds of years. |
Therefore, picture of God, are prepared without a beard and
moustache, (if a modern artist shows them, that is something
different). Thus, unlike other men, God is neither born, nor does
He, undergo any modifications, nor does He die.

'Bhitanamisvaro'pi san'—In spite of, being the only Lord
(great Lord) of all beings, God becomes a child, when He
incarnates Himself. But even then, He possesses His Lordly
nature—as Lord Krsna killed an ogress named Putana, of a
very huge and horrible body, when He was only six days old.

He killed the demons—Sakata, Trnavarta and Agha respectively,
when He was three months old, one year old and five years old
"
502,"Verse 6] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 461 .
respectively. Thus, in His childhood, He killed several demons. ,
He raised the Govardhana mountain, on the tip of His finger,

when He was only seven years old.

In spite of being the Lord of all beings, when He manifests |
Himself, He does not hesitate even to perform, the most menial :
job. This is His divine superiority. He works, as a chariot-driver
of Arjuna, and obeys him, yet His Lordliness, over Arjuna and |
other beings remains intact. That is why, in spite of being a -
charioteer, He preaches him, the gospel of the Gita. Lord Rama
carries out the order of His father, DaSaratha and goes into exile Bo
for fourteen years, yet His Lordliness over DaSaratha and other
beings, has not suffered, in the least.

'Prakrtim svamadhisthaya'— The Lord's pure nature (prakiti)
is different, from the three modes of nature—of goodness, of
passion and of ignorance. This pure nature, is His divine potency, — -
transcendental power, or delighting power. It is the embodiment of
truth, consciousness and bliss. It is, also called the sentient power
or power of grace. The same divine or transcendental power is
known as Sri Radha* or Sri Sita. It is, also called ‘devotion’ or
the supreme knowledge, by which God 1s attained. ;

Prakrti (nature), is the Lord's power, which is neither different
from God nor is one with Him. For example, fire has two kinds
of power, of lighting and burning. The first, removes darkness
as well as fear, while the latter, is used for cooking and heating
purposes. But, both these powers are neither different from fire,
as these are nothing but fire, nor are they one with fire, because
they can be subdued by sacred formulas, and herbs etc. :

As, the lighting and the burning powers of fire, remain innate

* The Lord manifests Himself with His pure nature (Prakrti) 1.e., His trans-
cendental power which works for Him. Sri Radha is His divine power and she
has several female friends who are the embodiments of devotion and they bestow
devotion upon His devotees. A person devoid of devotion can’t know them. A
devotee can know them only by the grace of Lord Krsna and $i Radha.
"
503,"462 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA © [Chapter4—-
in a match-box, so does God's power remain unexposed even _
though He pervades everywhere, all the time, in all things and
persons etc. The Lord, manifests Himself by keeping His nature
(prakrti) under control. As fire is not seen, until it is revealed
with its lighting and burning power, so is the Lord not beheld °
until He manifests Himself with His transcendental power, even
_ though He pervades everywhere all the time.

Sri Radha, Sri Sita and Sri Rukmini etc., are the Lord's -
own divine powers. He pervades everywhere universally, yet
He does not perform, any activity. Whatever He does, He -—.... ....
does with His divine power. The drama, that He stages with
His divine power, is so wonderful and uncommon, that human
beings having heard, sung and recollected it, are sanctified and
they attain salvation.

The same divine power, in the case of devotees, who are the -
worshippers of the attributeless aspect of the Absolute, becomes
the supreme knowledge of Brahma; while for devotees who 7
worship the Lord endowed with attributes, that power becomes
devotion. When a devotee has an exclusive devotion for God,

His divine power is revealed in him, in the form of his devotion. :
This devotion is so singular, that it attracts God and He in spite

of being formless, has to reveal Himself, endowed with that, |
form. This devotion, is also bestowed upon devotees by Him.

The divine power of God, in the form of devotion, is
perceived in two ways—disunion and union. It is by God's
grace, that there is disunion of a devotee from God, because in
that state, he becomes so much restless to meet Him, that his
attachment to the world is totally renounced and God manifests
Himself. In the Discipline of Knowledge, the divine power of
God is revealed in the form of keen desire to know. This keen
curiosity to know, compels a striver to know the real Essence.

Then, in the form of the supreme knowledge of Brahma, it roots
out ignorance and illumines the real self. But the divine power
"
504,"Verse 6] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 463 -
of disunion, is more powerful even than this. 'Where is God?’ |
‘What should I do to attain Him?' ""Where should I go?’ When
a devotee becomes restless, to attain Him, his restlessness roots
out all his sins, and reveals Him to him. This restlessness, is
a better means of God-realization, than knowledge. (wisdom or .
discrimination).
|
The Lord, manifests Himself by keeping His nature (prakrti)
under control, and stages, the drama of human life. As fire by oo enn
itself, does nothing, its lighting power provides light and its
burning power, burns things, so the Lord does nothing, but it is
His divine power, which does everything. In the scripture Sita.
declares, ‘It is I, who killed Ravana and other demons, while
Lord Rama did nothing’. | -
Like man and his power, God and His power, are neither
different from each other, nor are one. God cannot separate His -
power from Him; so it is not different from Him. A man remains
the same, but his power changes so it is not identical with him. -
Therefore, philosophers have called it, neither different nor one.
This power is indescribable. The devotees of Lord Krsna call
that power as Sriji (Radhaji). |
As a male and a female are two distinct entities, that way
Lord Krsna and Radhaji are not two. Lord Krsna and His power,
Radhaji in the Discipline of Knowledge become one, while, in
the Discipline of Devotion become two, Lord Krsna and Radhaji
become two*, so that they may stage the drama of human life,
in order to exchange love and thrill the devotees with delight.
When they become two, it is difficult to judge, who is superior,
and who the lover and who the beloved. Both of them, appear
*Lord Krsna and Radha are the oceans of savour, they are one
but they have become two in order to stage the drama of human life

uncommon and unique and they are attracted towards each other.
They are pleased by seeing each other. Their pastime of love,
for each other is enhanced. This is called ‘Rasa’ (sport). |

The Lord's powers. are infinite and limitless. His powers

can be classified into two groups, pertaining to glory and those

_ pertaining to sweetness or love. By His majestic power, He does
wonderful sports and feats, which none else can do. By this very
power, we find in Him excellence, eminence, singularity and ~
divinity which are neither heard nor seen anywhere else. While
He exercises His sweet power, He Himself is overwhelmed, and ae
forgets that He is Lord. When He manifests Himself in a sweet
mood, He appears to be very sweet and loving. He plays, with
cowherds like an ordinary cowherd. Similarly, He plays the role
of a friend, a son and a husband and so on, in the drama of life.
Thus He thrills His devotees with delight, with His sweetness -
and love, by not disclosing His glory and grandeur.

The Lord, reveals one of His powers at a time, either that of -
glory or that of sweetness. When any doubt arises in the sentiment
of sweetness, His power or glory is revealed. Lord Krsna as -
a cowherd, searches for calves. But, when doubt arises, about
their whereabout, His power is revealed and He immediately
comes to know, that the cows have been taken away by Brahma,
the creator.

The Lord is also the handsomest, so every being is naturally
attracted towards Him. Seeing His beauty, the women of Mathura |
say to each other— |

""Lord Krsna is the quintessence of handsomeness, no one can
compete with Him in the entire universe, He is handsome, even
without any outward make up, or ornamentation. No one is ever
satisfied by seeing His countenance, because His charm ever
remains fresh. All kinds of fame, beauty and glory, depend upon
His handsome appearance. It is very rare to behold Him. What
penances the cowherdesses must have performed so that they
"
506,"Verse 6] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 465
ever beheld His sweet countenance"" (Srimadbha. 10/44/14)?
Sn Sukadevaji says:—""O Pariksit! All the citizens of
Mathura and other people of the country, who were sitting on
the dais, having seen Lord Krsna and Balarama, were so much
pleased that their eyes and faces were glowing and filled with |
curiosity. They were not satisfied by looking at their handsome
faces through their eyes and it seemed as if they were imbibing
them with their eyes, licking them (with their tongues), smelling -
them (with their noses) and embracing them to their chests""
(Srimadbha. 10/43/20-21). So
Having seen the beauty of Lord Rama, king Janaka was
filled with joy and declared that his dispassionate mind, having
seen the sweet and handsome face of Lord Rama, was so much
enamoured as a 'Cakora’ (the Indian red-legged partridge) is, by
the moon (Manasa 1/216/2). a 7
Even the wild tribes, such as Kola and Bhila got |
enamoured of Lord Rama's countenance. They salute _
Lord Rama, offer their presents to Him, behold Him, with
great affection. They are so much enamoured of Him that
they remain standing there just like statues. Their bodies ;
are thrilled and their eyes are flooded with tears of love
(Manasa 2/135/3).
Not to talk of the Lord's devotees, even demons, such as
Khara-Dusana who have enmity with Lord Rama, are wonder-
struck with His charm. So they say:—Out of all the snakes,
demons, gods, men and ascetics, whom we have seen, conquered
and killed throughout our life, we have never seen such. beauty
(Manasa 3/19/2).
'Sarnbhavamyatmamayaya'—The Lord, does not reveal
Himself, to those who have a disinclination for Him, and
He appears to them, as a common man. ‘He stages a drama
of His human life, by keeping His divine potency concealed’
(Srimadbhagavata 10/29/1).
"
507,"466 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4

A devotee comes to know God, while a non-believer does |
not know Him. The more a devotee is inclined towards Him,
the more He reveals Himself to him.

Deluded people cannot know Him, because of their delusion
and because of the divine potency of the Lord (Gita 7/25). .
They cannot understand the infinitude of God, even when He
manifests Himself before them just as He manifested Himself
in the form of Draupadi's unending saree. Yet because of their -
delusion Duhsasana, Duryodhana. and Karna etc., could not know,

His manifestation. —

If a person gets rid of his delusion, he can realize the self
or God, but cannot behold Him.*

One can have a vision of the Lord, only when He unveils
Himself, by removing the veil of His divine potency. A man can _
get rid of this own delusion, but it is beyond his power to do
away with God's divine potency. If a person takes refuge in Him,

He removes his delusion and also helps him, to behold Him. -

The different plays, that the Lord stages, are accomplished
with the help of His divine potency. So people can see those plays :

no one can, elther see these, or relish these.

upholds, infinite universes yet He is known as 'Giradhari,' because
he lifted a mountain, 'Govardhana’. It is nothing surprising in

uphold a mountain. But, it is His peculiarity, in upholding it, as ©

innocent boy. While playing, He was defeated by other cowherds,
consequently, He had to carry the victor on His back. -
The. wise, remain absorbed in the self, but His devotees
relish His pastimes. Even Brahma, the leader of the wise, was Se
wonder-struck by beholding His pastimes, and so are the great
saints and ascetics who cannot understand the secret of His play
and remain dumb-founded. The Lord by His grace, enables those
devotees, who are exclusively devoted to Him, to know the secret
of His pastimes (Manasa 2/127/2). Lord Krsna while grazing -
cows, kills huge bodied demons, in no time. Despite being a |
boy, His Lordliness remains the same as usual. _
As a learned teacher, utters the letters 'a’ 'b’ 'c' etc., while
teaching the alphabet to a boy by descending to the boy's standard;
so does the Lord of infinite universes, preach the gospel to us, by -
becoming one of us, His wonderful and unearthly pastimes, lead
people to salvation, whether they listen to them, study or sing them.
Appendix—The Lord carries on His pastime with the help of
Prakrti. Therefore Sitaji declares, “I have performed all the deeds,
Lord Rama has done nothing (Adhyatma Ramayana, Balaka.
1/32—43). But like the man the Lord is not subordinated to
Prakrti—‘prakrtith svamadhisthaya’. The reason is that for the
Lord Prakrti is not different from Him but is identical with
Him (Gita 7/4-5). The Lord has to manifest Himself before
the man who is seated in Prakrti, therefore He reveals Himself
by subordinating His Prakrti (nature). Then only men can
behold Him.

abhyutthanamadharmasya tadatmanam srjamyaham
Whenever, there is a decline in righteousness and an upsurge -
in unrighteousness, O Arjuna, I then manifest Myself. 7
Comment:— | | |
""Yada yada hi dharmasya glanirbhavati bharata abhyutthanam-
adharmasya'—When righteous, innocent, weak, pious and spiritual
people, are exploited by unrighteous, cmel, strong, wicked and
- mundane people, and when moral values are lost and immorality -
prevails—that state, is the state of a decline of nghteousness,
and upsurge of unrighteousness. -
The terms ""Yada yada’ (whenever) show, that God manifests
Himself, whenever there is need for His manifestation. -
Example—when the seas were churned, God in the form of
unconquered Lord Visnu, churned the seas as a divine Tortoise,
held Mandaracala (mountain), pressed it hard, as a being with a |
thousand arms, and as a bewitching woman distributed the nectar
among the gods. Thus, God manifested Himself, in different
forms, at the same time.
The root, of the decline of righteousness and the rise of
unrighteousness, is its attraction towards the perishable. As the
body of a child, is inherited from the parents’ bodies, so, is
the universe created, by nature (prakrti) and God. Out of these,
(nature and its evolute), the world ever-undergo modifications,
while God and His fragment, the soul, ever remain uniform,
without the least modification. When a man, has a desire to
derive pleasure out of mundane objects, he starts having a fall.
"
510,"Verse 7] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 469 |
The more he is attached to worldly pleasures and prosperity,

the more increase there is, in unrighteousness. The more this
unrighteousness rises, the more vices, such as sins, strifes and

riots etc., prevail, in the society. | |

There is a decline of righteousness through the Satya age,
to Treta, Dvapara and Kali ages, respectively. In the Satya
age righteousness flourishes. In Treta, the decline begins, in
Dvapara there is a rapid decline and in Kali age, unrighteousness -
prevails. Then, God manifests Himself, for the establishment of
righteousness.

'Tadatmanam srjamyaham'—Whenever, there is a decline - oe
of righteousness and rise of ‘unrighteousness, then the Lord ~
manifests Himself for the destruction of unrighteousness and
for the establishment of righteousness.

When there is a decline of righteousness and increase in -
unrighteousness, people are inclined to unrighteousness, which
leads them to a downfall. The Lord, is the disinterested friend of
all beings, so He manifests Himself, 1n order to check their fall. -
_ When actions are performed with a selfish motive i.e., for
reward, there is a decline of righteousness; and when a man, °
having deviated from his duty performs forbidden actions, there
is rise of unrighteousness. It 1s desire, which is the root of all
unrighteousness, sins and injustice etc., (Gita 3/37). Therefore,

God manifests Himself, in order to root out this desire and
propagate the principle of the performance of actions, without
expectation of any reward. |

Here, a doubt may arise why at the present, in the wretched
Kali age, God does not manifest Himself, when there is such
a decline of righteousness and rise of unrighteousness. The
clarification is, that the time 1s not yet ripe. During the Treta
age, the demons having killed many sages, piled up their bones.

But, at present righteous persons are leading a pious and peaceful
life, and nobody kills them. Secondly, when there is decline of
"
511,"470 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4 .
righteousness and rise of unrighteousness, by God's direction saints
come to earth or true strivers reveal themselves; these establish
righteousness. Sometimes, the liberated souls: living in divine
abode also come to earth, to help the people to attain salvation,
as representatives of. God. Where, there are such strivers and
saints, there is, neither so much decline of righteousness, nor
so much increase in unrighteousness, as at other places where
_ there are, neither strivers nor saints. | -
When people do not follow the teachings of strivers and
saints, but start to kill them, and when there are left, only a - |
few righteous persons to propagate righteousness, and there is a
_ decline in righteousness, then God manifests Himself.

Comment:—
'Paritranaya sadhtinam'—God manifests Himself, in order
to protect the good, because they destroy unrighteousness and
propagate righteousness.
‘The term, 'sadhunam’' (of Sadhus) has been used for those
good men, who naturally are inclined towards the good of others,
who remember and chant the name, and think of form, qualities,
"
512,"Verse 8] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI AT]
glories and pastimes etc., of God, who propagate these among
people and who depend on God.

He, whose only aim is God-realization, is a good person (sage)
while one who hankers after worldly pleasures and prosperity, |
is not a good person. -

When a man, attaches importance to the perishable world,
desires are born. As desires increase, goodness disappears, but
when desires are renounced, goodness appears. Because, desire oF
is the root of evil. Goodness leads to salvation of one's self and |
to the welfare of others. _ a

Good people, are even engrossed in the good of beasts, birds,
trees, mountains, men, gods, manes and sages etc., through their
thoughts and deeds. In the Ramacaritamanasa the citizens of
Ayodhya say to Lord Rama, ""O foe of demons, in the world
there are only two, who do good to others, without any selfish -
motive, they are, You and Your devotees"" (7/47/3). :

If people come to know the thoughts and feelings of these -
Sadhus, they will ever bow to them. But if they know the |
thoughts and feelings of the wicked, there would be quarrels ;
and strifes. —

Here, a doubt may arise, why are such people seen .
suffering, when God protects them. The clarification is, that the |
Lord protects their good feelings, rather than their bodies, riches,
honour and fame etc. The reason is, that those good people -
do not attach importance to the mundane objects, because by
doing so, they may turn bad. The Lord also, would not attach
importance to them.

Devotees truly never desire, worldly objects. They are happy
in unfavourable circumstances, because these lead them to spiritual
upliftment. Devotion, develops in unfavourable circumstances,
because their attachment, which causes their downfall, is renounced. |
Therefore, the Lord protects the good, by creating unfavourable |
circumstances for them.

'Vinasaya ca duskrtam'—The wicked, propagate unrighteous- __
ness and destroy righteousness. So the Lord manifests Himself,
for their destruction. | os |

Those who, because of many desires, remain absorbed in
vices, such as falsehood, fraud, deception and dishonesty etc. __
Those who exploit the virtuous and good persons; those who
remain engaged in doing evil to others; those who do not know
what ought to be done and what ought not to be done; and those, _~
who always condemn God and the scriptures, such persons, of
demoniac nature, have been called wicked. The Lord manifests -
Himself for the destruction of such wicked persons.

Question:—The Lord declares, that He is the same to all
beings and there is none hateful, to Him (Gita 9/29); then why
does He destroy the wicked? a | |

Answer:—As the Lord is a disinterested friend of all beings, no
one is hateful to Him. But he who is an enemy of His devotees,
is also His enemy. In the Ramacaritamanasa, it is said, ""He who ~~
offends a devotee of Lord Rama, has to burn in the Lord's fire
of anger"" (2/218/2-3).

God is called, a devotee of His devotees: (Srimadbhagavata
10/86/59). So the wicked, who offend His devotees, are destroyed
by Him. Devotees, destroy sins while God destroys sinners. |

As His grace is revealed in protecting the good, so is His
grace revealed in destroying the wicked as He does evil to none
(2/183/3). Moreover, He purifies them by destroying them.

Saints also establish righteousness but they do not destroy the
wicked. Destruction of the wicked is brought about by the Lord in
the same way, as a simple injury may be dressed by a compounder
but a major operation is performed only by a civil surgeon.

Both the parents are equally interested in the welfare of
their son. When the son does not pay attention to his studies,
and indulges in mischief, both of them want to set him right.

The father beats him, so that he may give up his bad habit. The
"
514,"Verse 8] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 473
mother, checks the father from beating him: Being faithful, it is 7
her duty to follow her husband's footsteps. So should she also
start beating the boy, because she is faithful? No, it is her duty
to protect the boy, otherwise he may receive a severe beating. :
The father, also does not want to give him a good beating, but :
he wants the son to get rid of his bad habit. Similarly, God is
like a father, while saints are like a mother. First, the Lord and
saints urge people to give up their wickedness, but when they .
do not mend their ways, God has to manifest Himself for their
destruction. If they give up their wickedness, there is no need
to destroy them. | |
The attributeless Absolute, is not antagonistic to nature,
illusion and ignorance, it rather, gives existence inspires and
nourishes these. God, whether He is attributeless or is endowed
with attributes, fosters all beings, equally without any distinction. -
Even the earth, created by Him, provides room equally to everyone, |
whether he is virtuous or wicked. Similarly, all of them are
equally provided with the necessities of life, such as food, water, ;
air and sunlight. Thus the Lord is an ocean of generosity and
equanimity, even to the vilest person. If a person just thinks of His -
generosity, he gets thrilled with delight and starts bowing to Him.
The Lord, is not opposed to wicked person, but He is
opposed to their wicked actions as those actions are injurious,
to the world, as well as to them. The Lord is a disinterested
friend of all beings. Therefore, He destroys the wicked, in order
to do good to the world, as well as to those wicked persons.
How generous He is, that having killed those wicked persons
He sends them to His own abode!
Now a question may arise, whether the Lord Himself will
have to come to kill us, if we go on committing sins. If it is as
so, we shall attain salvation easily, otherwise we shall have to
control our senses, mind etc., and inculcate virtues and practise
spiritual discipline. The answer is, that the Lord destroys only
"
515,"474 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4 _ -
those wicked who cannot be destroyed by anyone, else. Secondly,
performance of good actions will lead us to virtues, which would
pave the way to our salvation. But if we are killed by anyone
else, or die a natural death while performing sinful actions, what
will be the consequences? How would our desire of being killed ~
by the Lord, be fulfilled? Therefore, sinful actions, should not
be performed at all.

- ‘Dharmasamsthapanarthaya'—Establishment of righteousness,  ~-
consists in preaching and propagating the selfless performance |

| of actions. Unrighteousness propagates, due to the performance  — —~.———

of action with a selfish motive and due to the attachment to the
unreal. Therefore, the Lord manifests Himself, in order to propagate
the performance of selfless actions, through His deeds. When this
feeling is propagated, righteousness, is naturally established.

The Lord is the abode of righteousness (Gita 14/27). So He ©

_..manifests Himself, in order to establish righteousness well. In fact,
righteousness never perishes, it only declines. Whenever there isa
decline of righteousness, the Lord re-establishes it (Gita 4/1—3).
| -'Sambhavami yuge yuge'—The Lord, manifests Himself, from -
age to age. He also descends to the mortal world, several times
in the same age, according to the need of the hour. He incarnates
Himself as 'Karaka Purusas’, as well as saints. The incarnations |
of the Lord and His ‘Karaka Purusas' (representatives), are casual
or occasional, while saints are regularly born.

Now, a doubt may arise, whether the omnipotent Lord cannot
protect the good, destroy the wicked, and establish righteousness
without manifesting Himself. The clarification is, that He can do
wonders without His manifestation also and go on doing so, yet
He manifests Himself in order to shower His special grace on
beings, for their welfare.* During His incarnation, His vision,

* The Lord manifests Himself as a human being in order to shower His
special grace on beings and He stages the drama of human life in such a manner
that it conduces them to be devoted to Him (Manasa 1/192).
"
516,"Verse 8] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 475 |
touch, talk etc., and later on, the practice of hearing, thinking,
chanting and following His sport, lead people to salvation.
The Lord, comes to the mortal world in different incarnations,
according to the need of the times. He remains perfect, during |
all the incarnations.
Though there is, nothing that should be done by Him, nor
is there anything unattained that should be attained (Gita 3/22),
yet He performs all actions by manifesting Himself, from time to
time, only for the welfare of the world. Therefore, human beings,
should also perform their duty, for the welfare of others. -
In response to Arjuna’s question which he put in the fourth
verse, the Lord explains the three main differences between men's
births and His births (manifestations):— |
(1) Difference in knowledge:—Many births of men, as well ~
as of the Lord, have taken place. Men do not know them all,
only the Lord knows. |
(2) Difference in birth:—Men have to take birth, under the
subordination of nature, (prakrti), in order to reap the fruits of
their virtuous and evil actions, and then to realize God. God
manifests Himself of His own accord, governing His nature
(prakrti) through His divine potency (4/6).
(3) Difference in actions:—Men perform actions, in order |
to satisfy their desires, though it is not the aim of human life,
while the Lord acts, only in order to enable beings to attain |
salvation (4/7-8).
Link:—In response to the question put, in the fourth verse,
by Arjuna, the Lord started describing the divine character of
His birth. Now in the next verse He, of His own accord, explains
the merit of knowing the divine character of His birth, as well as
actions, in order to explain the performance of actions without
expectation of fruit (Karmayoga).

Comment:— | |
‘Janma karma ca me divyam'— The Lord is beyond birth ~~~
and death, He is birthless and imperishable. His manifestation in
human body, is not like the birth of common men. He manifests
Himself of His own accord* in order to stage the drama of __
human life, for the welfare of beings. /
The form (body) of the Lord, unlike other beings, is not made
of flesh and blood. The bodies of beings are full of virtues and
vices. They are transitory, sick, mundane, changing, material and -
are born of ovum and semen, while the Form of the Lord, is free
frorn virtues and vices. It is eternal, healthy, spiritual, unchanging, —..
divine and is revealed. The bodies of gods, are also divine, but
_ the Form of the Lord, is far superior to those of the gods and
even the gods are ever eager to see this Form (Gita 11/52).
When the Lord descended on the mortal world, as Lord
Rama and Lord Krsna, mother Kausalya and Devaki, did
not give birth to Them. First, He revealed to them His four-
armed divine Form, with conch, disc, mace and lotus, and then
staged the drama of a child, then the mother, requested Him to
conceal that divine Form. The description has been, very clearly,
given, in the Ramacaritamanasa 1/192, as well as Srimadbhagavata
10/3/30 and 10/3/46.
* Uddhava tells Lord Krsna, ""You are the Supreme beyond Nature (Prakrti)
and You are Brahma, the very embodiment of knowledge; even then You have
manifested Yourself as a human being of Your ownaccord"" (Srimadbha. 11/1 1/28).
"
518,"Verse 9] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 477 :

When Lord Rama returned to His Abode, He, unlike common -
men, disappeared from this mortal world along with His body
(Form), His body was not left on the earth. It is said in the-
Ramayana by Valmiki, that having heard the words of Brahma,
the creator the very wise Lord Rama, having decided, entered the .
splendour of Lord Visnu, with His three brothers, in His Form. |
As far as Lord Krsna is concerned, the same fact, is mentioned
about Him in Srimadbhagavata that He also went to His Abode, -
in His Form (11/31/6)..

The same sort of description is available in Ramacaritamanasa,
when sage Valmiki says to Lord Rama, that His Form is divine Oo
and unaltered, only a deserving one knows the reality about Him,
when He manifests Himself as a human being, for protecting
saints and gods, and preach and act as a worldly king.

Once, sages Sanaka etc., were going to the Abode of Lord -
Visnu. The gatekeeper would not let them go in and they cursed
him. Knowing that His gatekeeper had insulted the sages, Lord
Visnu Himself came to the entrance. Having a vision of the -
Lord, and receiving the divine smell of basil leaves and shoots,
while bowing to Him, their bodies and hearts were thrilled, and ~
excited, though such wise sages, ever remain established in the
imperishable Lord (Srimadbha. 3/15/43). As the smell of the
Lord's lotus feet, is divine, His clothes, ornaments and weapons |
etc., are also divine, sentient and very singular.

Having heard, studied and recollected the pastime of the Lord,
people's hearts are purified and they get rid of ignorance—this
is the divine nature of His actions. Lord Sankara, Brahma, the
creator, sages, such as Sanaka etc., divine sage, Narada etc., who
are the embodiments of knowledge, having sung and heard of
His divine pastime, get absorbed in them. A person who visits
the places, where the Lord staged the drama of His human life,
with reverence and faith and resides there, attains salvation. It
means that the Lord manifests Himself and carries on His pastimes
"
519,"478 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA _ [Chapter4  -
in order to enable the people to attain salvation. Therefore, |
people attain their aim by reading, hearing and thinking, of His
divine pastimes. | :

In the fourth verse, Arjuna put the question to the Lord
pertaining to His birth, but here, the Lord starts describing his -
action of his own accord. By doing so, it seems as if the Lord |
wants to emphasize the fact, that a man's actions can also be
divine, though his birth cannot be divine as human life has been -
bestowed upon him only to perform, such actions. Actions are |
divine, when these are free from desire, for reward, attachment So
and a sense of 'mine.' Divine actions, lead to liberation from
the bondage, of the present as well as past actions, and these
naturally do good to others.

In fact, actions become impure, when a man. accepts his
affinity for perishable objects; and these lead him to bondage. -
This affinity, makes not only actions but also objects and mind,
impure. As soon as, this affinity is renounced, all the three become
pure. It is affinity for the perishable, which is the main obstacle
to salvation. , |

| 'Evar yo vetti tattvatah'—God in spite of, being without, :
birth imperishable and the Lord of all beings, manifests Himself,

of His own accord, and by keeping His nature (prakrti) under
control, for the welfare of all beings. He who knows this fact, |
realises the divine nature, of the births of the Lord.

Though all actions are performed by Him, yet He is a non- -
doer i.e., He has no pride of doership (Gita 4/13), nor does He
desire, the fruit of actions (Gita 4/14). He who knows fact,
knows the divine nature of the Lord's actions.

As the Lord manifests Himself, for the welfare of the entire __
creation and as He remains detached from actions, similarly,
those people, who live for the welfare of the world, and remain
detached from actions, know the divine nature of His births
(manifestations) and actions.
"
520,"Verse 9] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 479
'Tyaktva deham punarjanma naiti'—There is nothing in the |
thee worlds, that is to be done by the Lord, nor is there anything
unattained, that should be attained by Him (Gita 3/22), yet He
manifests Himself in this mortal world, by His grace to inspire -
beings to attain salvation. He carries on His wonderful pastime, |
also for the same purpose. When a person recites, hears, reads or
thinks of his pastimes, he is linked with the Lord. When he ts .
connected with the Lord his tie with the world is cut off. When
this bond with the world is snapped, he is not reborn i.e., he is
liberated, from the bondage of birth and death. OO
In fact, it is not action but desire, which binds a man and
this desire is man-made. In order to satisfy his desire, he performs
actions with a selfish motive, being attached to these, they bind ,
him. As desire is enhanced, he is inclined towards sinful actions, 7
which lead him to his birth, in evil bodies and to hell. But, when
he performs actions without a selfish motive for the welfare of
others, his actions become divine and uncommon, they do not
lead him to bondage and _ he is not reborn.
‘Mameti so'rjuna'—When a man assumes his affinity for ”
perishable actions, the ever-attainable Lord, seems unattained,
to him. But, when actions are performed without expecting any
reward, for the welfare of others, their direction is towards the .
world and the ever-attained Lord, is realized.
It is because of the Lord's divine nature, that He descends
to this mortal world, in order to shower His grace upon beings.
Those who know this fact, become His devotees and then remain
absorbed only in His adoration or devotion (Manasa 5/34/2).
This devotion, leads to salvation. Similarly, when a man knows
the divine nature of His actions then his actions also become
divine viz., pure and then these lead him, as well as others,
to God-realization (salvation) as he renounces his affinity for
the world. It is the affinity, which is an obstacle to salvation
or God-realization.
"
521,"480 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA | [Chapter 4
. Actions. are transitory and perishable, and so is their fruit,
while the self (soul) 1s uniform and eternal. Therefore, in fact the -
self has no affinity for actions, the affinity is merely assumed. |
While performing actions, if a man realizes that he has no affinity
for them, his actions become divine. This is the reality, about /
actions and this is Karmayoga. | |
When a man identifies himself, with active nature (prakrti), ee
it gives an impetus to action. He can never remain even for a
moment, without performing action (Gita 3/5). He thinks, that as
worldly objects are acquired by performing actions, so can the
Lord be realized through them. But, it is an error of judgement,
because only perishable objects, rather than the imperishable, Lord, -
can be acquired through perishable actions. The imperishable |
Lord, can be attained by renouncing affinity for actions. This
affinity for action can be renounced more easily, through the 7
Discipline of Action, than through the Discipline of knowledge.
It is so because when.all action with gross, subtle and causal -
bodies is performed, for the welfare of the world without any
selfish motive, their flow is towards the world, and so affinity |
for action is renounced. .
- The Lord, by using the terms 'Mameti' wants to explain,
that He whom, a man wants to attain through the performance
of actions is éver attained. What efforts are required to attain
Him who is ever attained and ever-existent? Whatever was not
otherwise attained is attained, by effort? _
Two aspects are noteworthy in this regard—origin and
discovery. Originated, is that which has no independent, existence,
and which was absent in the beginning and perishes in the end.
Discovered, is that which has a separate existence forever. But
God seems to get concealed, when importance is attached to
mundane actions and objects. When one uses actions and objects
"
522,"Verse 9] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI | 481 .
in rendering service to others, his affinity for actions and objects :
is automatically renounced and ever attainable God is revealed.

_ This is called discovery of the ever attained.

Carelessness and indolence, in the performance of actions |
and the desire for fruit of actions are the main stumbling blocks -
to God-realization. If actions are performed without the desire
for fruit in rendering service to others, the affinity for actions
is renounced and we realize our affinity: for God which is -
naturally eternal. . : :

Appendix—lIf actions are performed for the welfare of others eee
in a disinterested way or they are performed for the Lord’s sake,
those actions become divine and lead to’ salvation. But the actions
performed ridden with desire for one’s own self become impure
and lead to bondage. — |

Actions done without the sense of doership are of divine -
character. When ‘actions are not performed for one’s own self,
the sense of doership is wiped out. | -

The Lord’s most insignificant action as well as the most
significant action is His ‘pastime’. In His pastime the Lord ;
while acting like common men remains untainted (Gita 4/13).

The Lord’s drama of life is divine. This divine nature of His
drama is singular and is different from the divine nature of gods. |
The divine nature of gods in comparison with men is relatively
divine and is limited while the Lord’s divinity is absolute and
infinite. Though the actions of liberated, enlightened and God-
loving exalted souls are also divine but they are not like the
Lord’s pastimes. Even the common pastime of the Lord is very
uncommon (unworldly). As the Lord’s ‘Rasalila’ seems worldly yet
by reading it and by listening to it, a striver’s lust (sex) is wiped
out (Srimadbhi. tenth canto, thirty-third chapter, fortieth verse).

This world is the beginningless incarnation of God—
‘adyo’vatarah purusah parasya’ (Srimadbha. 2/6/41). It means
that God has manifested Himself in the form of the world.
"
523,"482 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4 -
But the embodied soul, because of his attachment to pleasures |
without recognising it as the manifestation of God, has sustained
it as the world—‘jivabhitarn mahabaho yayedam dharyate jagat’ .
(Gita 7/5). In order to wipe out this notion, a striver should firmly
believe that whatever is perceived (seen) is the manifestation of . -
God and whatever is happening is the pastime of the Lord. By
assuming (accepting) this, the world will not remain as the world
and ‘there is nothing except God’—this truth will be realized. In
other words the world will disappear and only God will remain.
The reason is that by thinking (accepting) everything and person ee
as the manifestation of God and every action as the Lord’s
pastime, attraction for pleasure and also attachment—aversion
will not persist. When attachment to pleasure is wiped out the
actions which seemed worldly, will appear divine as the pastime
of the Lord and the attachment to pleasure will be transformed -
into love (devotion) for God.
The Lord carries on this pastime according to the Form in -
which He manifests Himself.* When He takes the form of an

us, we regard these as of others and for others, and render service -
to others with these, attachment perishes because in fact, we
have no affinity for such objects and actions.
The Lord, without any selfish motive descends to the
mortal world, in order to inspire beings to attain salvation, as :
He is a disinterested friend, of all beings. When a man has
a firm belief that He is the disinterested friend of all beings,
he is attracted towards God. The attraction for Him wipes out -
attraction, (attachment) for the world. For example, in childhood
children play the game of marbles and have attraction for the a
same. They ever quarrel for their possessions. But, when they
grow old, instead of having attraction for marbles or toys they
have attraction for money. But, when they are inclined towards
God, they have no attraction for mundane objects and riches
etc. Their attachment for them, is renounced. As soon as it is -
renounced, fear and anger are rooted out, because both of these
depend on attachment. 7
""Manmaya'—When, a man knows the truth about the divine
nature of the Lord's birth and actions, He becomes, dear to him. -
So he takes refuge in Him, and gets absorbed in Him. |
Those, who have attraction for mundane pleasures get
absorbed in the desire for pleasure (Gita 2/43), while those, who ,
have attraction for God ever remain absorbed in Him (Narada-
Bhaktisutra 70). They lose their individuality, because of their
exclusive devotion to Him, and identify themselves with Him.*
‘Mamupasritah'—The expression, 'Vitaragabhayakrodhah’
denotes, total severance of connection with the world, while it also
indicates that a striver taking refuge in Him, gets absorbed in Him.
* Cowherdesses became just like their loving Lord Krsna in gait and
manners, laughter and merriment, glance, speech, inclination and facialexpression
etc. They having forgotten themselves totally became the embodiment of Lord
Krsna and copying His pastime began to utter,""I am no one else but Lord Krsna

world as Rama and Krsna etc., and also as a fish and a tortoise
etc. He carried on His pastime according to His Form. As in
‘varahavatara’ (incarnation as a boar) he played the drama as a
boar and in ‘Vamanavatara’ (incarnation as a dwarf) he carried |
on the pastime as a celibate. Therefore a striver should hold that .

Comment:—
'Vitardgabhayakrodhah'—When a man, has disinclination for
God, he gets attached to the perishable objects. It is, because of
his attachment, that he has the sense of 'mine,' for the objects
acquired and a desire for those unacquired. He has greed for the
acquired objects and gets angry with those who are obstacles to
the acquisition of those objects. If persons, who are obstacles, are
stronger than him, it causes fear. Thus, attachment to perishable
objects gives birth to fear, anger, greed, desire and feeling of
‘mine,’ and such other vices. If attachment is renounced, all these
vices perish. If instead of regarding the objects as ours and for
"
526,"Verse 10] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 485 -
A man has to depend upon something or the other in this |
world. He (the soul).in spite of being a fragment of God, having
no inclination for Him, relies on perishable objects, such as riches
etc., which lead to his downfall. Not only this, but even if he
depends, on intellect, in order to perform virtuous actions, on -
the practice of spiritual discipline or on renunciation of pleasure
and prosperity, he cannot realize God, quickly. So long as, he
(the self) does not depend on God, his dependence on world .
does not end, and he has to suffer pain.
A man, 1s attracted towards loving persons and objects, such mete wien
as his wife and son etc., while he, depends on his superiors,
such as parents and elders etc. But a devotee of the Lord, has
attraction for Him and also depends on Him, because for him,
He is most loving and superior to all. |
'Bahavo jiianatapasa pita madbhavamagatah'—Though a man, 7
is purified through the Discipline of Knowledge also, yet the
term ‘Jnana’ (knowledge), has been used, for knowing the reality -
about the divine nature of the Lord's birth and action. This
knowledge, purifies the man, because the Lord is the purest of
the pure. The soul being a fragment of God, is naturally pure. :
In the Manasa it is declared, ""The soul is sentient, pure and
naturally, a heap of joy"" (7/117/1). By attaching importance to
the perishable and by having the feeling of ‘mine’ with them,
he (the soul) becomes impure. When a man knows reality about
the divine birth and divine actions of God, his attraction for the
perishable and his feeling of 'mine’ for them, totally perish and
then all impurity comes to an end, and he emerges very pure.
This is Karmayoga. So the term, ‘Jnana’ can stand for
knowledge of Karmayoga, in which all acquired things, such
as the body, senses, mind, intellect, rank, ability, authority, riches
and property etc., are not one’s own or for one's own self, but
are of the world and for the world. Why? The reason is, that he
(the self) is eternal; so how can perishable things stay with the
"
527,"486 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4
imperishable soul, and be useful for It? Perishable things, such as |
the body etc., were neither with us before, nor will remain with
us after death, and at present also, they are being destroyed every
moment. We have a right, to make proper use of acquired objects,
rather than to lay claim to them. These things (objects), belong “
to the world and so they should be used in rendering service to
the world; this is their proper use. But if anyone regards these
as his, or for him, it is a bondage or impurity for him. -

When a person, does not regard perishable things, as his or
for him, it means that he performs the penance of knowledge, orn oe
which purifies him. The penance of knowledge, is superior to
all other austerities. Through this, the assumed affinity for the
insentient (matter), is renounced totally. So long as, a man assumes |
his affinity for the insentient, he is not so easily purified by -
any other penance, as he is purified by that knowledge, through
which, his affinity for matter is renounced. Being purified, by
the penance of knowledge, a man attains to His Being, which -
is Truth, Consciousness and Bliss. It means, that as the Lord is
eternal, he also resides in Him constantly; as the Lord is untainted .
and unaffected he also remains untainted and unaffected. As
nothing remains to be done by God, nothing further remains to
be done by him. A man, through the Discipline of Knowledge, .
also attains to His Being (Gita 14/19).

Many devotees, having been purified by the penance of
knowledge, have attained Him. So strivers at present, also
being purified by the penance of knowledge, should attain Him.
Everyone, is independent in attaining Him, because this human |
body has been bestowed upon them, only to. attain God.

how they attain Him. The Lord answers the question, in the

O Partha! However, the way devotees worship Me, so do

I approach them; for all men ultimately follow My path. 11

Comment:— : -
""Ye yatha mam prapadyante tamstathaiva bhajamyaham'— —

Howsoever, devotees seek God, so does He meet them, and grant oe

them their hearts’ desires. He reveals Himself, to a devotee, in

the same form in which he thinks of Him. If a devotee thinks

of Him, as his preceptor, He becomes an excellent preceptor.

Similarly, God becomes a worthy father or mother, son, brother,

friend or even, an obedient servant, according to the desire of -

the devotee. If a devotee, feels restless without God, He also

becomes restless without, His devotee. -
Arjuna regarded Lord Krsna, as his friend and wanted to

make Him his chariot-driver. Therefore, He became his chariot-

driver. Sage VisSvamitra, treated Him as a disciple; so He became

his disciple. Therefore, with whatever sentiment devotees seek

Him, He correlates, by the same sentiment. The Lord of infinite |

worlds, reciprocates to the sentiments of His own created common

beings. How generous affectionate and merciful He is!

This topic reveals, that the Lord manifests Himself for the |
sake of His devotees. He descends to the earth, according to

the sentiment of His devotees. It is mentioned in the Upanisad,

'The Lord felt lonely’ (Brhadaranyaka 1/4/3). So He manifested

Himself in different forms and started His sport. Similarly,

when devotees have a desire to take part in divine sport in the

company of the Lord, He manifests Himself, in order to take

part. When a devotee, cannot suffer his separation from God,

God also cannot bear it from him.
"
529,"488 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4 |
: ‘Though the words ""Yatha' (in whatever way) and 'Tatha’ (so) |
explains, that in whatever way a devotee seeks Him, He reciprocates
his sentiments, yet there is a great difference in their manner. If
a devotee takes one step towards God, God may take hundreds |
of strides to meet him. The Lord is omnipresent, omnipotent
and omniscient. Moreover, He is His devotee’s supreme and
unselfish friend and true to His resolve. A devotee should use
his full power to attain Him, then the Lord is attained, through -
His limitless power. |
A striver himself, creates obstacle in God-realization, because nnn
he does not apply his intellect, resources, time and power etc., to
| the full. extent, in order to attain Him. If he, without regarding
these as his own, utilizes them fully for God-realization, he
may realize Him soon. Actually, they are the Lord's, because
they have been bestowed upon by Him. A feeling of ‘mine’, -
is the main obstacle to God-realization. Man himself, is also a
fragment of God, but he considers himself separate from God, -
while the Lord does not think so. :
In fact, a striver cannot develop devotion to God, through the ;
performance of actions. Devotion, is automatically bestowed upon
a devotee, who takes refuge in Him. The refuge (surrender), is
the best sentiment out of all the other feeling such as of service,
of friendship, of affection and of sweet love etc. The Lord seems
to declare, that if a devotee dedicates his possessions to Him,
God would offer His possessions to the devotee; and if he offers
himself to Him, God reciprocates. What an easy and economic
transaction, God-realization 1s! |
When a devotee, surrenders himself at His feet, He does
not even remember his sins, of the past. He only thinks of his
| present emotions, hundreds of times (Manasa 1/29/3).
In this (eleventh) verse, there is no description of scriptural
subjects, such as dualism or non-dualism, the Lord endowed with
attributes or attributeless, or different kinds of salvation etc. But,
"
530,"Verse 11] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 489 .
here is a description of the feeling of ‘mine’, with God. ‘Only -
God is mine and I am only God's—this feeling of ‘mine’ for God,
enables a striver to attain Him, quickly and easily. Therefore, a
striver should accept his affinity for God, even if he does not |
understand it. By doing so, he will realize his affinity for Him .
which is real. oo |
Question:—The Lord, reciprocates the same sentiment with
which a devotee seeks Him. If a devotees approaches Him with oe
the sentiment of hatred or enmity etc., will the Lord, reciprocate
the same? a -
-Answer:—This is a topic of surrender (refuge) to Him, rather
than of hatred or enmity. So, no such question, should arise. Even
then, if we think over the question seriously, we come to realise
that the purpose of the Lord in reciprocating the same sentiment
to the person concerned, is to inspire him for salvation.* The Lord -
is a disinterested friend of all.beings (Gita 5/29). Therefore, he |
thinks of their welfare and acts, accordingly. He does the same,
_ even for those who may have feelings of hatred and enmity, -
for Him. When Lord Rama sents Angada as a messenger to the
court of Ravana, He urges him to convey his message in such -
a way that His purpose may be served and it may contribute to
his (Ravana's) welfare (Manasa 6/17/4).
Not only the Lord, but His devotees, are also disinterested |
friends of all beings (Srimadbhagavata 3/25/21). When, even a
devotee cannot harm anyone, how can the Lord, Who is the most
merciful and disinterested friend of all beings, harm anyone? A
person, may have affinity for Him with any sentiment yet He
inspires him for salvation only. As a bath in the Ganges, both in
winter and summer is rewarding, yet while bathing in winter a
man feels cold and during summer, he feels refreshed. Similarly,
| * Many persons out of desire, hatred, fear and love having concentrated their
minds on God, being purged of their sins, have attained God in the same way as |
devotees attain Him through devotion (Stimadbhagavata 7/1/29).
"
531,"490 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4
those devotees who worship Him with devotion attain eternal
bliss, but that bliss is not attained by those who have negative
feelings of hatred or enmity for Him.
‘Mama_ vartmanuvartante manusyah partha sarvasah'—
Whatsoever, a great man does, the same is done by others, as
well (Gita 3/21). God is the supreme Being. He is superior to
all the great men. So all people follow Him. The same fact, has
been pointed out, in the second half of the twenty-third verse -
of the third chapter. |
The Lord, ever remains prepared to reciprocate the wo
sentiment of His devotee. King DaSsaratha treats Him, as his
son. So He becomes an obedient son and cannot disobey His
father.* The Lord, wants to reveal the secret that a devotee
should accept the same relationship with Him, which he has
with a persons who is most loving to him, whether he is his -
son, father or whether she is his mother. By doing so, the Lord
will become most loving to him and thus the person will be
able to attain Him easily. Oo 7
Secondly, the Lord wants to urge the people, that by following
His footsteps they should also become worthy sons or parents or -
brothers, husbands, wives or sisters etc. Moreover, they should
render service to other members of a family, without expecting
any reward from them and without being proud of their action.
Those who have affinity with parents and other relatives, only
for rendering selfless service to them, follow the Lord's path in
the real sense. By doing so, for the good of others they will be |
free from the feeling of 'mine', and they will develop devotion
for God and attain Him.
Egoistic notions and selfishness, are the stumbling blocks to
* Lord Rama declares, ""I can enter fire, can eat deadly poison and can
jump into the sea in order to carry out the order of My father (Valmiki Ramayana,
Ayodhya. 18/28-29).
"
532,"Verse 11] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 491 :
devotion for God. When a man loves anyone, without egoism .
and selfishness, that love automatically flows towards the Lord.

It is because of egoism and selfishness, that his love is confined

to narrow limits. But, when such evil propensities are renounced, _

his love becomes widespread. In that case, the assumed affinity ,
for the world perishes, and instinctively the real affinity for God |
is revealed.

The man (soul) is a fragment of God (Gita 15/7) and so .
his affinity for God, is natural. But when he (the soul) having
forgotten this real affinity, assumes the affinity for the world, Se
he has to follow, the cycle (bondage) of birth and death. This
bondage is twofold. One is due to his not realizing his real
affinity with God. Another, is due to his assumed affinity with
the world. But when he realizes his real affinity for God i.e.,

~ takes refuge in Him, he becomes free from worry, fear, sorrow, -
and doubt. Then, he is said to follow, the Lord's path.

Appendix—Though this universe is clearly the manifestation
of God, yet the Lord reveals Himself before us in the same :
Form in which we perceive (see) Him. We regarding the self as
body need things and desire them, then God manifests Himself ""
in the form of those things. If being established in the ‘Asat’

(unreal), we perceive (see) the unreal, the Lord is also perceived
in the unreal form. As a child wants a toy, its father brings it a
toy even by spending money, similarly whatever we want, the
most merciful God ever being eternal Reality appears before us —
in the same form. If we don’t desire pleasures, why should the
Lord appear before us in the form of pleasures? Why need He
assume the artificial Form?

Though the terms ‘yatha’ and ‘tatha’ (‘as’ and ‘so’) have
been used for the Lord’s nature, yet the Lord ever showers His
great grace upon beings because an insignificant being can’t
be compared with the supreme Lord. What is the strength of
its own in a being except the sense of pride? Even then if a
"
533,"492 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4
person is attracted towards God, God is also attracted towards :
the person. As Viduraniji was oblivious of herself after beholding
Lord Krsna, Lord Krsna also was not in Himself and he ate the

skin of banana offered by Viduraniji and relished it.

In the Lord’s nature ‘yatha-tatha’ are applicable in actions :
rather than in feelings. The Lord also showers His love and
grace on an atheist ever in the same way as He showers it on
a theist (believer). Therefore in the Lord’s ‘yatha-tatha’ there is -
no selfish motive but it 1s the Lord’s glory (greatness) otherwise |
how can a common being be compared with the greatest Lord? oe
Even then he makes friends with an ordinary being and elevates
him equal to His rank. The Lord does not regard Himself as
great—this is His greatness.

Those who desire the fruit of their actions, worship the gods;
because success is quickly attained, by men through action, 12 :
Comment:—_

""Kanksantah karmanam siddhim yajanta iha devatah'—A man,
is eligible to perform new actions, and it is seen that success is
attained through action. So, he firmly believes that God is also
realized, through action (penance, meditation and trance etc.,)
just as, worldly objects are acquired through actions. He, does
not pay attention to the fact, that worldly things are acquired /
"
534,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 493 .

through actions, as they are limited, they are not ever attained, -

they are separate from us, and they are changeful, while the Lord _

cannot be acquired, through action, as He is not a product of

action. He pervades everywhere, is ever attained, is not separate

from us (the self) and is unchanging. So, He can be attained, as -

soon as a Keen desire to realize Him, is aroused. Keen desire

for God-realization, 1s not aroused, because of the preference,

for worldly pleasures and prosperity. -
The Lord, is like a father, while the gods are like shopkeepers.

We can take a thing from a shopkeeper, only by paying the money i

but we can take it from the father, free of cost. Similarly, we

have to perform rituals according to scriptural methods for gods,

in order to obtain fruits from them, while God bestows upon us

our necessities, free of cost. Moreover, as a shopkeeper gives

even hazardous things, such as, a match box or a knife etc., to -

a boy on payment, but if the boy wants such things from his

father, the latter will not only refuse but take away, the money

also. A father gives only beneficial things to a boy. The gods, -

also bestow upon their devotees, harmful gifts without thinking

of their welfare, at the due completion of a ritual. But the Lord, -

like a father, bestows only those gifts, which are for the welfare

of devotees. In spite of this fact, the ignorant or dull-witted

people, because of their attachment, sense of mine and desire

for the perishable materials, worship other gods, as they do not

realise the glory, the benevolence and selflessness, friendliness

of the Lord (Gita 7/20—23; 9/23-24). | ;
'Ksiprarh hi manuse loke siddhirbhavati karmaja'— This human

world, is the field for actions. Besides this, other worlds, such

as heaven and hell etc., are for reaping fruits of past actions.

The Lord also declares, ‘Below in the world of men stretch

forth the roots (of the universe as a tree) entangling man, in

the bondage of actions (Gita 15/2). But the other worlds (heaven

and hell etc.,) exist, so that human beings may reap desirable or |

undesirable fruits respectively of their virtuous and evil actions. |
"
535,"494 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4 |
Only human beings, are eligible to perform new actions, which

bear fruit here, as well as hereafter. Beasts and birds etc., cannot
perform new actions. | |

In this human world those people, who are attached to action,
live (Gita 14/15). It 1s because of their attachment to actions, that ,
they are charmed by success, which is attained through action.

This success is attained quickly, but it is shortlived. When actions
are transitory, how could success attained through actions, be -
permanent? Therefore, the fruit of perishable actions, is also 7
perishable. Those who perform actions with a desire for fruit, —
think of the fruit only, they do not think of the perishable nature, BO
of that fruit. They take refuge in the gods and worship them, only
_ because they bestow upon them success quickly, when rituals are
duly completed. But because of their desire for fruit of action, they
never get liberated, from the bondage of action. Consequently, they -
have to follow the cycle of birth and death.

The real success of human life is God-realization and that

: cannot be attained, through action. A striver cannot even follow, 7
the Disciplines of Action, Knowledge and Devotion, which are
the means of God-realization, through action. He can attain Yoga, -
not through action but through the, renouncement of actions.

Question:—Action is, said to be, the means to attain Yoga
(Gita 6/3). Then, how is it, that a man cannot attain Yoga
through action?

Answer:—In Karmayoga, actions are performed, in order to
renounce affinity for actions, and the material for actions. Yoga
(union with God) is natural. So Yoga or God-realization cannot
be attained through actions. In fact, actions are unreal, but when
these are performed for the sake of the Supreme, they are called
‘Sat’ viz., real (Gita 17/27).

When a person, performs action with a selfish motive, he does
not realize Yoga (i.e., eternal union with God). In Karmayoga,
actions are performed for others, not for one's own self i.e., not
"
536,"Verse 13-14] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 495 |
for their fruit (Gita 2/47). Actions, which are performed with a |
selfish motive, bind a man (Gita 3/9) while actions, which are
performed for others, liberate him, from the bondage of actions
(Gita 4/23). When actions are performed for others, affinity for
actions and their fruit is renounced, and that renouncement is
conducive to the realization of Yoga 1.e., union with God. |

While performing actions, a man has to depend on the
changing objects, such as the body, senses, mind, intellect, ~
person etc., which are different from the self (soul). The self,
ever remains uniform without undergoing any modification, at Se renee
all. Therefore, in Self-realization there is no need, in the least for
the objects, such as the body etc., which are different from the
self. A-‘man, naturally realizes the self, as soon as he renounces
his assumed affinity for worldly objects etc., which are different -
from him (the self). | |

Link:—Having described the object of His manifestation, -
in the eighth verse, the Lord explains the merit of knowing the
divine character of his actions, in the ninth verse. There He -
explained, that actions lose their divine character t.e., become
impure, when these are performed with a desire for fruit. In the
next two verses, the Lord specially, explains how, they gain their
divine character (purity).

‘Caturvarnyarh maya srstari gunakarmavibhagasah'—The Lord,
created the four castes (order)—Brahmana, Ksatriya, Vaisya and :
Sidra, according to the modes of nature, and actions of previous
birth.* Besides human beings, the Lord created the gods, manes ss ~ aan
and other forms of life also, according to the modes of their
nature and action, without showing the least partiality. -

- The fourfold caste (order), does not apply only to human >
beings, but also to birds, beasts and trees etc. Among birds, pigeons |
are regarded as Brahmana; hawks, kites and crows are regarded
respectively as Ksatriya, Vaisya and Sidra. Similarly Pipala, Nima, |
Tamarind and Acacia, are regarded respectively as Brahmana, —__ -
Ksatriya, Vaisya and Sidra. But, here the term 'Caturvarnyarh’ |
stands only for human beings, because they can understand this -
distinction and can perform their duty, accordingly.

‘When the Lord declares, that the fourfold caste was created
by Him, He means to say that all of these are his fragments and |
He is their disinterested friend. Therefore, He always thinks of
their welfare. On the other hand, they are neither fragments of
the gods nor are the gods their disinterested friends. So they |
should worship Him, only though the performance of their own
duty (Gita 18/46).

Sidra) are classified according to the mode of nature. In Brahmana the mode of
goodness predominates; in Ksatriya the mode of passion predominates, while the
modes of goodness is secondary; in Vaisya the mode of passion predominates,
while the mode of ignorance is secondary (subordinate); while in Siidra the mode
of ignorance predominates. Thus the castes were determined on the basis of the
mode of nature. :
"
538,"Verse 13-14] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 497 :
- *Tasya kartaramapi mam viddhyakartaramavyayam'—Though,

the Lord creates, preserves and destroys the entire universe yet He a

‘remains unconnected, (untainted) as He has no feeling of doership. |

He is called 'Avyayam' (unspent) only He is the material, as

well as, the efficient cause of creation. For example, in a pot of .

clay, clay is material cause and the potter is the efficient cause,

because while creating the world He remains uniform; neither

His energy is spent to create it, like the potter who spends his .

energy to make a pot, nor is the material consumed, when the

pot is made. | ee

The soul, being a fragment of God is also imperishable.

But, a man does not realize this fact, because he regards the

acquired body, senses, mind, intellect, wealth and property etc., -

as his own, and for himself. As soon as, he regards these as the

world's and for the world, he will realize his immortality. -

By using the term ‘Viddhi', the Lord urges strivers, to
understand the divine nature of His actions. When actions are -
performed without having any affinity for those or, the material
and the fruit of actions, then these become divine. _- ;

'Na math karm4ni limpanti na me karmaphale sprha'—When
the Lord, creates the universe, He has not the least affinity for
his actions, nor is there any flaw or partiality etc., in His actions,
nor any attachment or feeling of ‘mine’, or desire for the fruit
of actions. So those actions do not taint Him.

All perishable objects, are fruits of actions. The Lord urges |
strivers, that they, like Him should have no craving for the fruit |
of actions. If they perform actions, without having any craving
for the fruit of actions, the actions will not bind them. |

In the thirteenth verse, the Lord explained that He is a non-
doer i.e., He has no sense of doership,; in spite of performing
all actions, such as the creation of the universe etc. In this
verse, He explains that He has no craving for the fruit of
actions. Therefore, a striver should also perform actions, without
"
539,"498 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4 =.
a sense of doership and without having any desire for the fruit |
of actions. By doing so, he is automatically liberated from the -
bondage of actions. |

""Iti mam yo'bhijanati'—Desires are born, when a man has
an eye on the perishable mundane objects and then he cannot ”
know the reality about God, Who is immortal. As soon as,
desires are renounced, the inner sense is purified and then
naturally one reflects on God. By having an eye on Him, :
he comes to know that, He is a disinterested friend of all
beings, and all actions performed by Him, aim at the welfare, ee
of all beings. The Lord, bestows this human body upon us,
in order to enable us to be liberated from the bondage of
actions. But, a man without knowing this fact, assumes his
affinity for actions, and is thus held captive. Therefore the
Lord in spite of having, neither a sense of doership, nor, desire -
for fruit, creates the universe by His grace, so as to inspire
human beings, to attain salvation, by becoming free from the
bondage of actions. When a man knows Him thus (in reality),
he is attracted to Him. So Lord Siva in the Ramacaritamanasa
says to Uma, ""He who knows the nature of Lord Rama, ever -
remains engrossed in His adoration"" (5/34/2). |

""Karmabhirna sa badhyate'—The Lord's actions are ever divine.
The actions of saints and sages also become divine. Not only
saints and sages, but also men can make their actions divine, by
doing away with desire, attachment and a sense of 'mine’, which
are impurities in actions. When actions are purged of impurities,
these become divine and they do not bind men. These lead them,
as well as others, (who follow them), to salvation.

An easy means, to make actions divine is to use the objects
etc., acquired from the world, to render service to the world,
without regarding these as one's own, and for one's own self. |

We should give a serious thought to the fact, that we neither
brought the objects, such as the body etc., with us, when we
"
540,"Verse 13-14] SADHAKA-SANIHIVANI , 499 -

came, nor can we carry these with us when we go, or change |

these of our own accord, nor maintain them. Similarly, the subtle -

and the causal bodies, being the evolutes of nature (prakrti), also

undergo modifications and therefore, we have no affinity for

these. Moreover, those objects are not for us, because had they -

been for us, or having acquired them, there would have been

no further desire, to acquire anything else. So it is a blunder to

accept these as ours, and for us. They seem to us to be ours, -

so that we use them 1n rendering service to others rather than

to lay a claim on them. | ee
We should have no desire to acquire anything from the

world nor even, to gain any favour from God. We should rather

surrender ourselves to Him. The Lord Himself, has provided all

the necessities of life to us,.because He is very gracious and

merciful. He knows our needs more than we know ours as we -

are dull-witted while, He is very sharp. So, without desiring

anything, we should use the things that we possess, for the 7

welfare of others without any selfish motive. By doing so our

affinity for actions and objects etc., is renounced and God, Who

is an embodiment of Bliss is realized. -
Appendix—Though the author of worldly creation, the non-

doership of God remains unaffected, similarly the non-doership |

of the self also remains unaffected—‘Sarirastho’pi kaunteya na

karoti na lipyate’ (Gita 13/31). But being deluded, he thinks

that he is the doer—‘ahankaravimudhatma kartahamiti manyate’

(Gita 3/27).
‘Karma’, ‘Kriya’ and ‘Lila’—the three may appear to be

the same but really they are totally different. The ‘Kriya’

which is done with the sense of egoism and bears desirable

and undesirable fruit, is called ‘Karma’ (action). The ‘kriya’

(activity) which is done without the sense of doership and which

does not bear fruit, is called ‘kriya’ as breathing, opening and

closing the eyes, movement of the pulse, beating of the heart |
"
541,"500 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4
etc. The ‘Kriya’ which is free from the sense of doership and ""
from the desire for fruit, and also divine, and for the welfare -
of the world, is called “Lila’. Actions done by worldly people
are karma and by liberated people are kriya* and by God
they are mere sports or say “Lila’—‘lokavattu llakaivalyam’ -
(Brahmasutra 2/1/33) viz., as the world without real existence
appears to be existing, similarly the Lord’s activity such as
the creation of the universe etc., is merely His pastime. It -
means that the Lord in spite of being the non-doer seems to
be a doer because of His pastime. | So

‘Caturvarnyamh maya srstarhn gunakarmavibhagasah’—this
expression proves that according to the Gita a person’s caste
is determined by his birth. A person’s caste or Varna (order of
life) is determined by the caste of his parents. The word ‘jati’ |
is made from the root ‘jani pradurbhave’ which proves that the :
caste 1s determined by birth. By ‘Karma’ there is the word ‘krti’
which is made from the root ‘dukrfi karane’. But the caste is -
fully preserved by only discharging the duty prescribed for one’s
own caste. .

was a seeker of liberation (salvation), but he did not think that
the performance of his duty (of fighting) would lead him to .
salvation. So he wanted to renounce the duty, as to him it
was horrible (Gita 3/1). Therefore, Lord Krsna urges Arjuna a
to attain salvation, through performing his duty, and cited the
example of ancient seekers of liberation, who attained salvation
by performing their duty. |
The Lord, is emphasizing the same fact here, which He _
mentioned, in the twentieth verse of the third chapter, by citing
the example of Janaka and others, and, in the first and second |
verses of this chapter, by citing examples of Vivasvan, Manu _
and Iksvaku etc.
It is mentioned in the scriptures, that when desire for liberation -
is aroused in a striver, he should abandon actions, because in that
case, he becomes eligible to attain knowledge (wisdom), rather
than to perform actions.* But here, He urges Arjuna, a seeker
of liberation, to perform his duty in a disinterested manner, and
cites the example of other ancient seekers of liberation.
Karmayoga (Discipline of Action) consists, in remaining
established in Yoga (union with God) while performing duty, _
and in performing duty while remaining firm in Yoga. Actions
are performed for the world, while Yoga (union with God) is
for one's own self. Performance of actions and non-performance |
of actions, are two states. A Yogi, transcends the two, without

being attached to either of the two. This Yoga is detachment
incarnate. This is not a state. It is God-realization. .
The Lord, in the fourteenth verse, declared, ""Actions do not
taint (bind) Me, since I have no craving for the fruit of actions.""
A person, who having known this skill (Karmayoga) performs _
actions, by renouncing the desire for fruit, is not bound by actions,
as the Lord declares, ""He who is attached to the fruit of action,
| is bound"" (Gita 5/12). Actions, which a man performs, in order -
to gain pleasures or wealth or honour and praise or paradise
etc., bind him (Gita 3/9). But, if he performs actions, for the — ........
_ well being of others, without any selfish motive, to renounce his
affinity for the world, the actions do not bind him (Gita 4/23).
_ The reason is, that when actions are performed for others, the
. flow is towards the world and thus attachment for them perishes.
No new affinity for them is born, because there is no desire ~
a for the fruit. :
| ""Kuru karmaiva tasmattvam piurvaih pirvataram krtam'—  _
| The Lord orders Arjuna to perform actions, for the welfare of
the world, like other seekers of liberation, because he 1s also a
_ seeker of liberation. , 7
All the mundane materials, such as, the body, senses, mind
and intellect etc., required for the performance of actions, have
_ their identity with the world, while they are different from the
self. They have been acquired from the world, so that service
to the world may be rendered, with them. If they are used by
- a person in performing actions for himself, he gets attached to
those actions, but if all actions are performed for the welfare of
: others, he is not attached to them. As soon as, this attachment
is renounced, he realizes his Yoga i.e., union with God, which
- is eternal. ,
Appendix—In the thirteenth and fourteenth verses the Lord
declared, “I. perform actions such as the creation of the universe
etc., but those actions don’t bind Me because I am free from

544,"Verse 16] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 503 :
the sense of doership and the desire of fruit.” Here the Lord
declares that the seekers of salvation have also performed actions -
by renouncing the sense of doership and the desire for fruit. The
reason is that actions performed with the sense of doership and ;
with the desire for fruit alone lead to bondage. Therefore the :
Lord asks Arjuna to perform actions in the same way as the
seekers of salvation have performed. !
In Jiianayoga first there is renunciation of the sense of -
doership and then the desire for fruit automatically disappears.
In Karmayoga first there is renunciation of the desire for fruit OO
and then the sense of doership easily get extinct.

knowing which, you shall be liberated, from its evil effect (i.e.,)
worldly bondage. 16
Comment:—-
‘Kim karma'— Common men believe that activities done with
the body and senses are mere actions, while non-performance of
an act, is inaction. But, the Lord declares that activities performed
with body, speech and mind, are actions (Gita 18/15).
An action, is determined by the: motive by which, it is
performed. An action, such as adoration of a goddess, is of the
"
545,"504 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA  =—=———s‘[Chapter4
mode of goodness, but if it is undertaken with the motive of
fulfilling mundane. desires, it becomes a mode of passion. If it —
is undertaken with the motive of someone's ruin, the same action
is, of the mode of ignorance. In the same way, actions which
are performed without attachment, a sense of mine and desire
for fruits, are classed as inaction, and these do not bind a man,
to the fruit of action. It means, that truth about action cannot be
determined by outward activity only. In this connection, even wise ~
men, possessing knowledge of the scriptures get confused, L.e.,
they are, at a loss to understand the truth. An action is classed, ——--—---—-
as an action or inaction, or is forbidden, according to the motive
with which it is performed, Therefore, the Lord declares, that
He will explain to Arjuna, what action is, why and how it binds
.. aman, and how he can be liberated from it and by knowing
| the truth about it. ;
If a man, has a sense of mine, attachment and desire for
' fruits, it means that action is being performed by himie., he -
is tainted by that action, even though he does not perform an
outward action. On the other hand, if he has neither a sense of __
mine, nor attachment nor.desire for fruit, it means that actions
are not being performed by him i.e., he is not tainted by such
actions, even though he performs actions. Thus performance or |
non-performance of actions is inaction, if he has no attachment,
while performance or non-performance of actions is classed as
action, if he has any attachment. |

'Kimakarmeti'—The Lord, divided action into two
groups—actions and inaction. Actions, bind a man, while inactions
(which are undertaken for others) liberate him.

In reality, physical abjuring of actions, is not inaction.
The Lord, has declared that the renunciation of actions,
through delusion is stated to be, of the nature of ‘ignorance’
(Gita 18/7). The exclusion of action, from fear of physical
suffering, is called ‘passionate’ (Gita 18/8). In the renunciation
"
546,"Verse 16] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 505
of the nature of ‘ignorance’ and ‘passion’, the affinity for actions is |
not renounced, though the performance of actions is. Renunciation, :
in which attachment and desire for reward, are abandoned, is _
regarded as one of 'goodness' (Gita 18/9). In fact, this is. called -
‘inaction’, because affinity for actions is renounced in such a

exclusion. Therefore, inaction, consists in the performance of

actions, by remaining untainted by them.

‘Even the wise are confused, about the truth of what, an :
inaction is. The reality about an action or an inaction is, that it :
should not bind a man. Arjuna holds that he will attain salvation 7 oe
if he does not indulge himself in the cruel deed of fighting. So
the Lord declares, that a man does not attain to perfection, by :
mere renunciation of action (Gita 3/4) but he can attain it, even |
by engaging himself in battle (Gita 2/38). -

Thus inaction, consists either in the performance of actions
by remaining untainted or in remaining untainted, while
performing actions. | -

'Kavayo'pyatra mohitah’'—How can common men understand
the truth about action and inaction, when even the learned who
are well-versed in the scriptures, are at a loss to grasp this topic?

It means, that only the liberated souls or the Lord knows, the
truth about action and inaction. | : 7

'Tatte karma pravaksyami'—A man, (the soul) is bound
by actions, so he would also be liberated, by action. The Lord
promises here that, He will declare the reality about actions, so
that they may not lead him to bondage and he may be liberated _
from the bondage of the cycle of birth and death.

In fact, it is neither action nor inaction;which binds a man, |
but it is the desire, the sense of mine and attachment, which
bind him. If he renounces desire and feelings of possession and
attachment, he is liberated, while performing action, and not by |
performing it. One, who understands this fact, knows the reality
about actions.
"
547,"| 506 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4  ~
In the fiftieth verse of the second chapter, the Lord declared,
""Yoga is skill in action.” It means that Yoga viz., equanimity ~
(evenness of mind) is the means to be liberated from the binding
nature of actions. Arjuna could not understand this point; therefore,
the Lord promises to explain this point again. .

of these. |
As the body, senses, mind and intellect etc., are acquired these
are transitory. They should be used, only in rendering service
. to the world, because these have been acquired from the world.
Moreover, these will have to be renounced. But, the Self or God
Who is ours, can never be renounced. Only that which is really
not ours, but we have assumed as ours, is renounced. In fact, _
this is not renunciation, it is discrimination.
: All materials, (the body, senses, mind and intellect etc.,) are |
neither of the self, nor for the self, but are of the world and for
the world. The self ever remains unaffected and uniform, while the
) materials are changing. Therefore whatever action 1s performed,
with these materials is for the good of others, not for the self. In
this there is a vital fact, that no action can be performed, without
materials. Even the greatest writer cannot write, without ink, pen
and paper, which are of the world. Therefore, when a person,
uses the articles of the world for the world, he in fact, does not
render any service to the world, he gives the things of the world
to the world. Thus he merely uses his discrimination. Thus, it is
discrimination which leads to renunciation and service.
Discrimination has been bestowed upon beings from time
immemorial. Had it been the fruit of virtuous action, how could
virtuous actions have been performed, without discrimination? It
"
548,"Verse 16] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 507 7
is discrimination by which one can resolve, to perform virtuous a
actions, by renouncing evil actions. As discrimination is self- a
evident, so is Karmayoga (Discipline of Action) which involves
no labour. Similarly, in the Discipline of Knowledge, the self .
(Which is detached) is self-evident, while in the Discipline of =
Devotion, the affinity for God is self-evident.
'Yajjiatva moksyase'subhat'—The self, is good and virtuous,
while the ever-changing world, is bad or evil. The self, in spite of -
being an eternal fragment of God, and developing adisinclination ==
for God, has got entangled in the perishable world. The Lord oe ,
declares, that He will describe reality about action, by knowing,
which he (Asjuna) will be liberated from its evil effect i.e., worldly
bondage of the cycle of birth and death. Oo |
[The topic of knowledge of action, which begins in this verse,
will be concluded in the thirty-second verse with the declaration, ~
""Thus knowing, thou shalt be liberated"".] |
In the term, 'Karmayoga' Karma (actions) are performed for
the world, while Yoga (union with God), is for the self. Action Oe
and non-action—these are the two states of action, which involve
egoism. So long as, a man has egoistic notions he has, affinity
for the world; and so long as he has affinity for the world, he .
continues to have egoistic notions. But ""Yoga' transcends the two
states. In order to realize that Yoga it is essential to be free
from egoism. The method of being free from egoism, is |
performance or non-performance of actions, by being equanimous
and remaining equanimous during performance or non-
performance, of actions. It means, that he should have equanimity
(evenness of mind) during the performance and non-performance
of actions (Gita 2/48), i.e., he should remain untainted. |
Those, who believe that a man is inclined towards the world
by performance of actions, and is inclined towards God through :
"
549,"508 _ SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4  -
non-performance of actions, and having a disinclination for the
world, meditate on God and experience a trance, also perform _
actions. The feeling, that God (perfection) will be attained through
meditation and trance, is also a subtle form of action, because
one expects God-realization through performance of actions, in _
the form of meditation and trance, while God is beyond action,
as well as inaction.
The Lord declares, that He will explain the reality about _
action by which one will attain God, immediately. God pervades
: everywhere, all the time, through things, persons, bodies, senses,
minds, intellects and life-breaths etc., equally. He remains united.
with us, when we perform actions and when we do not perform
actions. But, we are unable to realize Him, because of our affinity —
for actions and objects, born of nature (prakrti).
Aman has an egoistic notion, equally during the performance -
| of actions, as well as during the non-performance of actions, but his
egoism merges in the world, when he instead of performing actions
for himself, performs these, for the welfare of the world. -

Comment:—
‘Karmano hyapi boddhavyam'— He, who remains untainted
while performing actions, knows the truth about actions, described
"
550,"Verse 17] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 509
in the eighteenth verse, by the expression, ""He who sees inaction -
in action.""

Actions can be divided, into three groups, according to the
motive by which these are performed (1.e.,) action, inaction and :
forbidden action. An activity undertaken, according to spiritual
injunctions with a desire for fruit, is called, action. Action
which is performed, being free from the desire for fruit, sense 7
of mine and attachment, for the welfare of others, is classed, 7
as inaction. Even prescribed action, performed with the motive
of doing evil to others, or giving pain to them, is classed as, oO
forbidden action.

'Akarmanasca boddhavyam'— He, who performs actions, while
remaining untainted, knows the reality about inaction, described :
in the eighteenth verse, by the expression ‘action in inaction.’ -

""Boddhavyam ca vikarmanah'—When a man has desire, actions
are performed. But when desire is enhanced, then forbidden ;
actions (sinful) are done.

The Lord, in the thirty-eighth verse of second chapter,
declared, ""Treating alike, pleasure and pain, gain and loss, :
victory and defeat, get ready for battle, the horrible deed involving
violence; thus thou shalt not incur sin."" It means, that if actions
are performed with equanimity, the seemingly forbidden actions /
are also transformed, into inaction.

Forbidden actions, are called 'Vikarma’'. Desire is the cause
of forbidden actions (Gita 3/36-37).* Therefore, in order to give
up forbidden actions, one should renounce desire. The essence of
""Vikarma’ (sin), is desire and to know the essence of ""Vikarma’,
is to abandon all forbidden actions physically and so leave no
trace of desire which is the cause of ""Vikarma’.

* In the sixteenth chapter where the demoniac nature has been described
there from the eighth verse to the twenty-third verse the term 'Kama’' (desire)
has been used nine times. It shows that desire is the cause of demoniac nature |
(forbidden actions).
"
551,"510 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4
'Gahania karmano gatih'—It is difficult to understand, which .
actions bind a man and which liberate him. Even learned men,
knowing the scriptures cannot decide, 'What is action?’ 'What
is inaction?’ and ""What is forbidden action?’ Arjuna also, finds = -
himself in a dilemma and so he thinks, that the performance of
his duty of fighting is a cruel deed. Therefore, the Lord states,
‘that mysterious is the nature of action. _
Question:—In this verse, the Lord declares, that truth about |
forbidden actions must be known, while He does not make mention wo
of the forbidden actions, in the topic from the nineteenth verse
to the twenty-third verse. Why? : |
Answer:—In the topic (from the nineteenth verse to the twenty-
third verse), the Lord, has prominently mentioned inaction in
action so that all actions may turn to inaction 1.e., actions may -
not lead to bondage. A desire is the root of every action. As
the desire intensifies, it results in forbidden actions. Therefore it -
is said that Vikarma is quite near to karma. Therefore, the Lord
has referred to forbidden actions, as wretched, so that men may
renounce these, as well as the desire which is their main root. :
First, desire leads a man to action, and then its enhancement,
leads one to perform forbidden actions. But, when desire is ;
renounced, all actions tum to, inaction. The significance of
the topic, discussed in these verses, is to know the essence of
inaction and what leads to annihilation of desires. When desire
is renounced forbidden actions are not performed. So the Lord,
does not consider it necessary to include 'Vikarma’, in the topic,
from the nineteenth to the twenty-third verses. Secondly, the Lord
does not want to dwell upon forbidden actions in detail, because
these must be renounced as they lead to sins and hells. But, in
this topic there is an emphasis on, the renunciation of desire—in
4/19 by the expression ‘devoid of desires and thoughts of the
world’, in 4/20 by, the expression ‘having abandoned attachment
to the fruit of action’, in 4/21 by the expression ‘having no desire’,
"
552,"Verse 18] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 511. -
in 4/22 by 'even-minded in success and failure’, and in 4/23 by |
‘One who is devoid of attachment and works for sacrifice.’ -
Thus, the Lord has said, that truth about forbidden actions =
must be known, so that a man, having known it, may renounce -
desire, which is the root of forbidden actions. .
Appendix—lIt is very difficult to gaze what fruit an action bears -
at present and in future for others. While performing an actiona |
man thinks that it is of benefit to him but actually it causes harm -
to him. He may work for profit but it may end in loss. He acts
for pleasure whereas his act results in pain. The reason 1s that due To meee
to the sense of doership and the desire for fruit (attachment to —
pleasure), man cannot determine the true nature of actions.
Link:—In the next verse, the Lord eulogizes a person who -
knows the truth, about actions. |

Comment:—
'Karmanyakarma yah paSyet'—'Seeing inaction in action’ |
means, to remain untainted during performance or non-performance
of actions. It means also that performance or non-performance
of actions, is not for the self. When a man thinks that he is the
doer and so he should reap the fruit of action, he is bound by
such actions. As actions are perishable, so is their fruit. The self,
is eternal and has no affinity for the changing actions, and their
fruits. Yet, It is bound, because of the desire, for fruit. Therefore,
the Lord in the fourteenth verse declared, ""Actions don't bind |
"
553,"512 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA _ [Chapter4
Me, because I have ‘no desire, for the fruit of actions."" It is the
desire for fruit, which binds one. The Lord declares, ""He who ;
is attached to the fruit of action, is bound"" (Gita 5/12). |
If a striver, has no desire for fruit, new attachment does not .
arise; and old attachment perishes, when actions are performed
for the welfare of others. Thus, he becomes, totally dispassionate.
This dispassionate nature, turns all actions into inaction.
A man, has to take birth either to be free of obligations or
receive these from others, for all previous births. This exchange
has been going on for several births. He cannot get rid of the ne
cycle of birth and death, so long as, he does not repay his debt.
The way to close his account is, that he should pay to others |
what he owes to them and should not expect them to repay to
him, their debts. Thus, the account will be closed and, he will _
be liberated, from the cycle of birth and death (Gita 4/23).
If a person does nothing for himself, and has no desire,
he gets detached from all actions and objects etc., because all :
objects and materials etc., such as the body, senses, mind, intellect
and life-breaths are of the world, not one’s own as these have .
been acquired from the world, so that service may be rendered
to the world with these. Therefore, when a striver performs all
actions (service, adoration, chant, meditation entrances also) for ;
the welfare of the world, the flow of action is towards the world
and the striver, remains detached and untainted. This is ‘seeing
inaction in action.’
So long as, a striver has affinity for the body and the world,
the performance or non-performance of actions, will be included
in action. So, a Karmayogi should remain untainted (detached),
while he performs actions, as also while he does not. When a
man performs actions, without having any desire for fruit, profit,
honour, praise and pleasure, here or hereafter, it means, that
he is detached (untainted) during the performance of actions.
Similarly, when he does not perform any action, he should not
"
554,"Verse 18] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 513 :
desire, in the least, to gain honour, praise, pleasures and bodily _ |
rest etc., by non-perfotmance of actions.

He, who abandons action, because it is painful or out of fear —
from physical suffering or practises relinquishment of passion, |
(Rajasa Tyaga)while he who renounces his obligatory duty :
out of delusion, indolence and heedlessness, practises Tamasa
Tyaga. Both kinds of relinquishment, must be totally abandoned.
Similarly, if a man does not perform action, so that he may -
enjoy the state of meditation or trance or liberation, he does
not get detached from nature (prakrti). When he renounces his ae
full affinity for nature, he remains untainted while performing
actions or not performing these. .

‘Akarmani ca karma yah'— ‘Seeing action in inaction’ means,
performing action or not performing it, by being detached (untainted).

- Worldly people want to gain, something or the other,
through performance and non-performance of actions, while a
Karmayogis only aim through the two, is the welfare of the -
world, by remaining detached. The Lord declares, “For him there
is no interest, in what is done or what is not done"" (Gita 3/18). .
If he has any self-interest, he is not a Karmayogi, but is rather
a doer of actions. :

So long as, a striver assume his affinity for nature, he
holds that he progresses in the mundane sphere through the
performance of actions, while in the spiritual sphere, through
their non-performance. But, in fact, it is not so. As walking and
eating etc., are actions of the physical body, so are reflection
and meditation, the actions of the subtle body and trance, the
action, of the causal body. Therefore, he who performs his duty
(action) for the welfare of the world, by remaining detached
(untainted), sees inaction in action. The same, has been pointed
out, in the forty-eighth verse of the second chapter, by the
Lord, when He declares, ""Perform action, being steadfast in
Yoga (equanimity).""
"
555,"514 $RIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4
' Activity or non-activity with some motive in the world,
are both actions. To remain quite detached, while doing actions
or refraining from them throughout, and being detached, while
there is performance or non-performance of actions,—this total
detachment under all circumstances, is called Yoga’, and is :
'‘Karmayoga.'
A striver should remain equanimous, during the performance
or non-performance of actions, called Karmayoga. -
Question:—Why has the Lord mentioned ‘inaction in action’
and ‘action in inaction’, while in both cases, inaction or detachment, oa
is the predominating factor?
Answer:— When a man sees inaction in action, there remains
the dominance of detachment. But, when he sees action in inaction,
there is predominance of performance or non-performance of -
action. It means, that detachment has its affinity for the self,
while performance or non-performance of actions, has its affinity
for the world, including the body. Therefore, detachment is one's _
own duty, while performance or non-performance of action, is
the duty of another. In order to differentiate the two, the Lord has ;
mentioned ‘seeing inaction in action’ and ‘action in inaction’.
In the Discipline of Action, there is performance or non-
performance of action, for the welfare of the world without |
_ attachment, because, while performing actions, one should remain
detached and while remaining detached, one should perform
actions—these two aspects are the principles of the Gita.
‘Pravrtti’ (activity) and ‘Nivrtti' (non-activity)—both are in
domain of nature. Nature is ever-changing and So is performance
or non-performance of actions, while the Self Which is the
illuminator and base of the two, ever remains uniform without
undergoing any modification. In order to explain this fact, the
Lord has declared, that he who sees inaction in action, and action
in inaction both is wise. It means, that a striver while remaining
established in the self, should perform actions for the welfare of
"
556,"Verse 18] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI. 515
the world viz., as a sacrifice (Yajiia). 7
‘Sa buddhimanmanusyesu'—The striver, who sees inaction in .
action and action in inaction i.e., remains detached (untainted),
and knows the truth about action. Unless he is detached 1.e.,
regards objects and actions as his, and for him, it means that
he has not known the reality about actions.
In order to, know the truth about God, a striver has to
identify the self with Him, while in order to know the reality -
about the world, he has to separate the self from the world
(actions and objects), for he (the self) has identity with God, ee
while he is different from the world. All actions, are transitory
while the self is eternal.
As a common man cannot remain unsoiled, in a coal cellar,
only a wise man could do so, similarly, only a wise man can
remain detached from actions, while performing these. Therefore, ~
here as well as in the tenth verse of the eighteenth chapter, the
Lord calls such a man wise among men. He wants to say that
for such a wise man, nothing further remains to be known. :
| 'Sa yuktah'—A Karmayogl, remains equanimous in success
and failure, because he totally renounces the desire, for the fruit -
of actions. Here the term ' Yoga’, stands for equanimity. One is
a Yogi, because he remains established, in equanimity.
Every being has a natural union with God, but he forgets it, |
because he assumes his affinity for the world. When he performs
actions for the welfare of the world, by renouncing desire for
fruit, a sense of possession and attachment, his assumed affinity
for the world is renounced and he realizes his union with God,
which is natural and eternal. For such a Yogi nothing remains
to be attained, for he has achieved Divinity.
“Krtsnakarmakrt'—So long as, a man has to attain something
or the other, he has to perform actions viz., his attachment for
- actions, does not wither.
Perishable actions bear perishable fruits. So long as, one
"
557,"516 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4 :
has desire for the perishable, he will have to undertake actions.
But, on having renounced all affinity for the perishable, he .
attains to the Imperishable Lord and nothing further remains
to be done. Then, a Karmayogi has nothing to do, with the
performance or non-performance of actions, 1.e., he becomes a 3
performer of all actions. |
When nothing remains to be done, to be known and to
be attained by such a Karmayogi, he is liberated from the _
evil, bondage of the wheel of birth and death in the world |
(Gita 4/16, 32). oe
Appendix—There are two spheres—one of action and the other
of inaction. Out of these two, inaction is the essence. Therefore
he who sees inaction in action viz., while performing an action
remains untainted and he who sees action in inaction viz., while
remaining untainted performs action, for him nothing remains to -
be done, to be known and to be gained. As at the beginning of
an action “GaneSaji’ is worshipped but during the performance
of the action ‘Ganeégaji’ is not worshipped all the time. But it :
is not the case here of remaining untainted in actions at the
beginning only. Therefore the Lord has mentioned inaction in -
action and action in inaction. It means that one should never
be tainted (desire for fruit and the sense of doership) viz., he
should ever remain untainted. :
In the eighth verse of the third chapter the Lord declares
that the performance of an action 1s superior to inaction—‘karma
jyayo hyakarmanah’ while here He declares that it is better to
see inaction (non-doership) than the performance of action; and
for the person who is thus untainted, nothing remains to be done,
to be known and to be gained. It proves that a man should be
free from the desire for fruit and from the sense of doership.
because these two severally bind a man. |
Link:—Now, the Lord in the next two verses, describes the |
"
558,"Verse 19] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 517 .
_ enlightened soul (sage) who sees inaction in action and action -
in inaction, 1.e., who knows the truth about action. .

He, all whose undertakings are free from Sankalpa and desire -
and whose actions are burnt up in the fire of wisdom, him the |
seers, call wise (Pandita). 19 ee
Comment:—
'Yasya sarve samarambhah kamasankalpavarjitah'—Thinking
of sense-objects and remembering these time and again, and
thinking that some of these are good, useful and pleasurable, is a |
mental resolve (Sankalpa) and ""Vikalpa (uncertainty) is antithesis -
of Sankalpa, ""these are not good and are injurious."" This type
of thinking, the Vikalpa-intellect is the abiding place of positive _
and negative projections. When negative projections, give way
to positive ones, at that time a desire to obtain those objects
arises. This is known as ""Kama’. In an accomplished Karmayogi, :
projection and desire, both are absent e.g., there remains neither
‘Sankalpa, which is the origin of desire nor desire which is its
product. Therefore, all actions of a 'Karmayogi' are free from :
resolve and desire.
‘Sankalpa' and desire, are the two seeds of action. If they are
no longer there, action becomes inaction, that is to say, actions
lose their binding potentiality. In a liberated soul, these two
are absent, so actions performed by that are not binding. Even
though, he does everything, in order to maintain social order and
protect the chain of social obligations, yet he is quite untainted
with his actions, whatsoever.
The Lord, has prescribed on occasions the renunciation
of desires (6/4), of mental projections (2/55), and of both
"
559,"518 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4
these (6/24-25). Therefore, wherever in Gita renunciation of :
‘Sankalpa’ is prescribed, it must always be together with desire .
as well. In a nutshell, a striver should give up projections and
desires both. :

There are four states of a motor car. -

1. When a motor car stands still, in the garage, its engine
does not function and the wheels don't move forward.

2. The engine starts functioning, but the wheels do not, -
move forward (it's all loss and no gain).

3. The engine functions and the wheels move and cover - .......
some distance.

4. On a downward slope, the engine is stopped, while the
wheels move and cover a distance (it's all gain and no cost).

Similarly, a man may have four states— |

1. Neither desire, nor action. -

2. Desire but no action (it's all loss and no gain). |

3. Desire as well as action. -

4. Action, but no desire (it's all gain and no cost).

The best state of a motor car is the fourth one, when the car ;
runs, but no petrol is consumed. Similar, is the case with man.

The best state is when he performs action, without having any
desire. Even the wise, call such a man a sage.
'Samarambhah'—Here, this term stands for, the undertaking
of a Karmayogi, which are free from attachment and aversion.
It does not stand for the word 'arambha' (undertaking), used in
the twelfth verse of the fourteenth chapter, because there ‘pravrtti'
(activity) and 'arambha'—two terms have been used. There, the
term 'pravrtti' stands for the performance of duty, while the term
‘arambha’, stands for the undertaking of actions for pleasures
and prosperity. A sage or an enlightened soul, performs action
scrupulously according to the ordinance of the scriptures, for

the welfare of all beings.
The terms 'sarve', expresses the meaning, that all his
"
560,"Verse 19] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 519 -
undertakings are free from the thought of the world and desire. |
From morning till night, whatever he does, for the maintenance of -
his body, such as washing, eating, walking etc., and for spiritual
upliftment, such as chant, adoration, reflection, meditation and
trance, is free, from the thought of the world and desire. .
' Jnanagnidagdhakarmanam'—Wisdom, consists in knowing
the truth that actions have their affinity for the body and the
world, not for the self, because, actions have a beginning and -
an end, while the self remains stable. All actions, are burnt in
the fire of this wisdom i.e., actions cannot bear fruit in the form
of bondage (Gita 4/16,32).
In fact, the body and actions; have their identity with the |
world, while the self is different from these. But, by an error,
he (the self) assumes his affinity for these. Great souls have no
affinity for their so-called, bodies. As actions are performed by -
the entire world, so are actions performed by their so-called,
bodies. Thus, when they are detached from actions, not only ©
their present actions, but also the stock of past actions are burnt, -
in the fire of wisdom. As far as, their fate (prarabdha karma) is
concerned, it creates favourable and unfavourable circumstances, .
but being detached from the fruit of actions they neither feel
happy nor sad. The ‘prarabdha karmas'’, get effaced by creating
transitory circumstances. ,
'Tamahuh panditam budhah'—It is easy to know the reality
about an ascetic, who having renounced actions externally
ever remains absorbed in the adoration of God, but it 1s very
difficult to know the truth about a man living a householder's life
who performs his duty scrupulously without being attached to
actions, in the least. The sages also declare, ""Those who have
renounced the world, enlighten others, and everyone knows them. :
But a householder saint, 1s rarely known.""
As a lotus leaf in spite of being born in water and living
constantly in touch with it, is not tainted by water, so does a
Karmayogi, in spite of being born in a life-of-action (human life)
"
561,"520 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4 ~
and in spite of living, in this world of actions, while performing _
actions, does not get attached to these.* Detachment from actions,  -
_ is not an easy task. Therefore, the Lord, in the eighteenth verse,
: has called him wise among men, while here He declares, that
the wise call him a sage. It means, that such a Karmayogi, is —
the wisest among the. wise.

One having abandoned attachment to actions and their fruit,
ever content, without any kind of dependence, he does nothing -
even though fully engaged in action. 20
Comment:— | | | ;

: 'Tyaktva karmaphalasangam'—lIf a man thinks, that he is the
doer while performing action, regards the body and the senses
etc., as his, considers the action as his and for him and expects :
its fruit, then, he becomes the cause of fruit of action. But an
enlightened soul, totally renounces his affinity for the mundane
materials and so he is not, in the least, attached to materials for |
action, to action and to the fruits of action. Thus, he does not
become the cause of the fruit of action.

As, an army fighting under the guidance of a king, with
material supplied by him gains victory over an enemy, but the
credit for the victory goes to the king; similarly, a soul attached
to the body, senses, mind and intellect etc., is held responsible,
for the fruit of actions performed by these.

* Even Renunciation of actions of a deluded person is conducive to
action while even performance of actions of a wise man leads to actionlessness |
(Astavakra Gita 18/61). |
"
562,"Verse 20] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 521 -

A great soul, having not the least attachment for actions, and
material for actions, is not attached to the fruit of actions. | -

In fact, the self has no attachment for actions and their
fruits, because It is sentient, imperishable and unaltered, while -
actions and their fruits are insentient, perishable and undergo
modifications. But when It assumes Its affinity, by an error, for
them, it is bound. If It renounces this assumed affinity, It will -
realize its detachmemt from actions, and their fruits. : .

""Nirasryah'—Even, a king or an emperor, has to depend on oo
circumstances, time, objects and persons etc. But an enlightened :
soul, does not depend on these, because having realized the self
or God, he remains satisfied in the self, whether he acquires
anything or not. |

'Nityatrptah'—The soul, being a fragment of God is real, and -
the real never ceases to be (Gita 2/16), but when it assumes its
affinity for the unreal, it feels a deficiency. In order to compensate
for the shortage, it has a desire for worldly objects. It is satisfied ;
by acquiring the objects but that satisfaction is temporary as
the objects are perishable. How could the unreal, satisfy the -
real? Therefore, so long as, the soul assumes Its affinity for the
perishable actions and objects, and depends on these, It does not
realize, the satisfaction automatic, which is eternal. The same
eternal satisfaction has been referred in the seventeenth verse of
the third chapter, by the expression ‘atmatrptah' (satisfied with
the self).

'Karmanyabhipravrtto'pi naiva kificitkaroti sah'—The term,
‘'abhipravrttah’ means, that all actions are scrupulously performed |
by emancipated soul, because he is not at all attached to actions
and their fruits. All his actions, are performed for the welfare
of the world.

He who is attached to the fruit of action, cannot perform
actions, scrupulously, because a lot of his energy is wasted, by
thinking of the fruit. : ,
"
563,"522 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4
The term ‘api’ (even or though) means, that such an enlightened
soul does not perform an action at all, though he is fully engaged,
in action. It is because of his detachment, that all his actions
change into inaction. | -
When he does nothing, how could he be bound by the |
fruit of actions? Therefore, the Lord, in the twelfth verse of the
eighteenth chapter, declares that a Karmayogi, who has renounced
the fruit of action, does not reap the fruit of action 1.e., becomes -
free from the bondage of action. : |
Prakrti (nature) is ever-active. Therefore, solongas,aman = —™
has affinity for the modes of nature (actions and objects), he gets
attached to them, even without performing action. If he has no
affinity (attachment) for the modes of nature, he does nothing,
even though, he is ever-engaged in action, as all his actions are -
performed, for the welfare of the world. 7
Appendix—So long as a man has the sense of doership,
during the performance of action or non-performance of action, __
he remains a doer. But when the sense of doership is wiped
out, he does nothing at all or his action or inaction never comes -
under the category of action at all.
Link:—Having described the detachment of an enlightened
soul, in the nineteenth and the twentieth verses, now the Lord,
in the twenty-first verse, describes the detachment of a striver
who does not perform duties enjoined by the scriptures, while,
in the twenty-second verse, He describes the detachment of a
striver, who performs his duties. _ .

incurs no sin. 21

Comment:— ~
'Yatacittaétma'—A man, cannot keep his body, senses, mind and

the self, under control, because of hope or desire. When he has

no hope or desire, his body, senses and mind etc., automatically -

remain under his control, and then no futile action 1s performed

by him. _ |
'Tyaktasarvaparigrahah'— If a Karmayogi is a recluse, he

renounces all worldly possessions. But, if he is a householder,

he does not accumulate any worldly object, to derive pleasure

out of’it. He, by regarding it as the world's, uses it in rendering

service to the world. It is inevitable for every striver not to -

hanker after, mundane pleasure.
[This is the only verse in the whole of Gita, where there -

is description of renunciation, of all worldly possessions. In the

tenth verse of the sixth chapter, there is an explanation of the |

renunciation of possessions, for a Yogi who practises meditation,

while in the fifty-third verse of the eighteenth chapter, there is an

account of the renunciation of possession, for a Yogi, who has /

attained the supreme state of knowledge. But here, in this verse,

renunciation is superior to those renouncements, because only

here, the adjective 'sarva' (all) has been used with 'parigrahah'

(possessions). The term, ‘aniketah' (homeless or having no fixed

abode) has been used, for freedom from attachment to the abode,

in the nineteenth verse of the twelfth chapter, for a Bhaktiyog!.]
‘Nirasih'—A Karmayog], has no hope, no desire and no lust.

He does not hanker after worldly pleasure and prosperity. Even

if, he is not able to renounce his hope or desire totally, he aims

at their renunciation.
'Sarirarn kevalarn karma kurvan'—The actions expressed in
"
565,"524 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter4 ~
this term may be of two kinds— (i) actions which are undertaken |
by the body and, (ii) actions which are performed, for the -
maintenance of the body. The former, have been described, in

the eleventh verse of the fifth chapter, when the Lord declares,
""Men of action having abandoned attachment, perform actions ~—
only with the body, mind, intellect or even with the senses, for the
purification of the self."" But, this verse is pertaining to detachment _
of the striver, who does not even perform duties, enjoined by = -
the scriptures. Therefore, here it is used in the latter sense 1.e.,
actions (as eating, drinking, bathing, washing etc.,) which are oe
necessary, for the bare maintenance of the body, are performed,

by a man of action, who has abandoned attachment. ;

‘Napnoti kilbisam'—He, who 1s attached to the performance
or non-performance of action, in the least, incurs sin 1.e., follows
the cycle of birth and death. But, the man of action, being -
free from hope or desire, is not attached to the performance or
non-performance of action, so he incurs no sin, all his actions -
change into inactions. :

Such a Karmayogi (man of action), does not indulge in ;

indolence and heedlessness. These two are, also enjoyments.
Lying idly in a lonely place is an enjoyment and indulgence in
useless and forbidden actions, is also an enjoyment. Through
such indulgences, a man enjoys himself. Thus he incurs sins.
But a Karmayogi, who is given to performing some action, does
not indulge in indolence and heedlessness. His mind, senses and
body, are under his control. Moreover, he is free from hope, desire
and a sense of possession etc. So, forbidden actions cannot be
performed by him, and thus he incurs no sin. Had he indulged
in indolence and heedlessness in the least, it could not be said
of him, that he incurs no sin.

Now a doubt arises, why it has been said that he incurs no
sin, when forbidden actions cannot be performed by him. The
clarification is, that all undertakings are enveloped by defects
"
566,"| Verse 21] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 525 -

(sins). The Lord declares, ""All undertakings are clouded by defects, .

as fire by smoke"" (Gita 18/48). The root of sins, is desire or a -

sense of mine or attachment. A Karmayogi (man of action), is

free from desire, sense of ‘mine’ and attachment, or he has such

an aim, so he has nothing to do, with the performance or non- ~

performance of action. Therefore, he does not incur incidental

sin, during the performance of his duty, nor does he incur sin,

by the renunciation of his duty, enjoined by the scriptures. -
A second doubt may arise here, that the Lord has directed

even a wise man (who has attained perfection), to perform action ee

for the welfare of the world (3/25-26). The Lord has also declared,

""There is nothing in the three worlds, that should be done by ;

Me, nor is there anything unattained, that should be attained,

yet I engage Myself in action"" (Gita 3/22—-24). Therefore, will

a Karmayogi, who does not engage himself in action for the -

welfare of the world, not incur sin? The clarification is, that he |

will incur no sin, because he is free from desire, attachment etc.,

and a sense of mine. Though the Lord and wise men (enlightened -

souls), are totally free from desire and attachment etc., yet out

of compassion (grace), they perform actions for the welfare of -

the world, even when it is not obligatory for them (Gita 3/18).

Such ascetic-Karmayogis, as described in the verse, are also

ideal for ascetic strivers of Karmayoga and are automatically, a -

source Of inspiration for strivers and common folk.
The third doubt that arises, is that the Lord, in the thirteenth

verse of the third chapter declared, ""Those wicked people who

prepare food for their own sake, verily eat sin"", while here, He

declares that he who performs action for the mere maintenance ~

of body incurs no sin. Thus there seems to be a contradiction.

The clarification is, that so long as there is desire for pleasure

as well as attachment to actions, and materials, he incurs sins,

whether he performs actions or does not perform these, but when

he becomes free from desire and attachment, he incurs no sin.
Question:—Can this verse not be included in the verses
"
567,"526 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 4 -
pertaining to the Discipline of Knowledge, as these reflect the |
marks of a man of knowledge? -
Answer:—The first point is, that here the context is of
Karmayoga. Secondly, a Jani (liberated soul), holds that he
does nothing at all (Gita 5/8) i.e., he sees inaction in action. .
So it cannot be said about him, that he incurs no sin while
performing action, because he does not think he is a doer or he
performs any action at all. ~
Though in the striver, who follows the path of action,
discrimination is not clearly revealed, yet he has a determinate TO
intellect, about three facts, that nothing 1s his, nothing is required
for him, and nothing is to be done for him. Having resolved this, :
he remains detached, from actions in spite of performing these.
Generally, people believe that a Karmayog! leads the life of . _
a householder, while a Jianayogi follows the renounced order.
But, in fact it is not so. A Jiianayogi (man of knowledge) is he,
who can discriminate between self and body, whether he leads -
the life of a householder or of a renounced order. But, he who |
cannot discriminate self from the body, despite a determinate ;
intellect about above-mentioned three facts, is only a Karmayogi,
whether he is a householder or is of a renounced order. :

of profit and loss, and accordingly, he makes wise efforts also.
But, in effect he feels neither happy nor sad. Even if evenness
of mind is lost, a striver, should not lose heart, because the :
disturbance of mind is short-Hved and disappears quickly.
The term ‘labha’ denotes, profit as well as loss, agreeable SO
as well as. disagreeable, whatsoever is obtained.
'Vimatsarah'—A Karmayogi, identifies himself with all.
beings. He realizes his self as the self, in all beings (Gita 5/7).
So he is not at all envious of any being. A Karmayogi, is very -
cautious lest he should be envious of any being, because all
his actions are performed for the welfare of the world. If he is
envious of anyone in the least, his undertakings cannot be for ~
the welfare of the world. : |
Envy is a subtle evil. Even neighbouring businessmen, friends “
and members of a family, are seen getting envious of each other,
because of each other's good fortune. Where, there are antagonistic
feelings, this evil is found in abundance. Therefore, a striver, -
should be on his guard against this evil.
""Dvandvatitah'—A . Karmayogi, transcends the pairs of
opposites, such as profit and loss, honour and dishonour, praise
and blame, pleasure and pain, and desirable and undesirable
circumstances. So, he has a balanced state of mind, free from
attachment and aversion etc. : |
Similarly, there can be the influence of the opposites in
beliefs, one may believe in the Lord, Who is endowed with
form and attributes, while the other may believe in the Lord
Who is formless and without attribute; one may believe in the
dualistic principle, while the other in the non-dualistic principle.
"

Whether mind is absorbed in God or not, whether seclusion is -
procured or not, whether peace is attained or not, and, whether
success is achieved or not, a striver, is free from all such pairs
of opposites, like a balance which remains steady, when there -
is equal weight on either side. A Karmayogi, free from the |
pairs of opposites, is easily released from the bondage of the
world (Gita 5/3). | : -
_ ‘Samah siddhavasiddhau ca'—He remains even-minded in
accomplishment or non-accomplishment of the work and for SC
getting or not getting its fruit in success and failure, pleasure
and pain, without having attachment or aversion for them. The
same evenness. of mind by the expression has been pointed out
here as well as in the forty-eighth verse of the second, chapter.
When a striver realizes, the three facts, that nothing is his, -
nor is for him and nothing is to be done for him, he attains a
state of total evenness of mind.
| 'Krtvapi na nibadhyate'—When a Karmayogi is not bound, ;
even while acting, there is no question of his being bound without
acting. He remains free, from attachment in these two states. -
As a Karmayogi who performs action merely for the
maintenance of the body, is not bound, so is a Karmayogi, who
performs actions, sanctioned by the scriptures, not bound. |
In fact, it is neither performance nor non-performance of
actions, which binds a man but it is attachment to these which
binds him. Similarly, it is detachment, which liberates him from
bondage. A Karmayogi, like an actor, plays his part according
to his caste and order of life and being detached from them.
He is not at all attached to the changing nature (Prakrti), he
remains established in the eternal self.Therefore, he automatically
remains even-minded, and thus is not bound, by actions even
while performing these. |
If a serious thought is given, it becomes clear, that equanimity
is natural. Everyone, knows that he remains the same in both

we commit an error, that.we keep an eye on circumstances, but we

do not watch the Self. Consequently, we feel happy or sad. -

Comment:—

[This verse, is an important one about the Discipline of —
Action, because only here, it is mentioned that all actions of -
a Karmayogi, are destroyed. Similarly, the thirty-sixth verse of
the fourth chapter, is an important verse on the Discipline of
Knowledge, while the sixty-sixth verse of the eighteenth chapter
is an important verse, on the Discipline of Devotion.]

'Gatasangasya'—Attachment, to actions, objects, incidents, |
circumstances and persons, leads to bondage i.e., the cause of
birth of the soul in good and evil bodies (Gita 13/21). When
a man performs actions for the welfare of the world, without
any selfish motive, he becomes free from attachment, for
actions and objects.

In fact, a man (the self) 1s inherently detached, 7
"
571,"530 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4
(Brhadaranyaka 4/3/15). But in spite of being detached, he gets
attached to the body, senses, mind, intellect, objects, circumstances,
and men etc., by regarding these as his own, and is thus bound
by desire for pleasure. So long as, he wants to satiate his desire, .
his attachment is enhanced. In fact, whatever is to happen, will :
happen and whatever is not to happen will not happen, whether
one desires it or not. Therefore, he who has any desire, gets
entangled in vain, and has to suffer pain. -
A Karmayogi, considering the acquired things of the world,
neither of his own nor for himself, utilizes these, in rendering Be
service to the world. Thus the flow of things and actions, is
towards the world and the self remains the same, as it is, |
non-attached. |
He has no egoistic notion of rendering service to others -
because he thinks that he has discharged his debt by returning
thing to the one to whom it belonged. If egoistic notion subsists,
_ it binds a Karmayogt. It subsists only when he considers, the -
materials for service, as his own. When the subtle egoistic notion,
is rooted, then only pure service remains. Moreover, he does not -
expect any reward, in the form of money, honour, praise, position
and authority etc., because he does not lay claim to these. He
wants, neither to be called a generous man, nor gets pleased if
praised by calling him, generous, or derives pleasure out of his
act of service. By doing selfless service, he gets placidity of
mind. If that placidity is not enjoyed, he automatically realizes,
axiomatic detachment. .
""Muktasya'—A man (the soul), in spite of being different, |
from actions and objects, such as the body etc., assumes these as
his own, because of desire, attachment and a sense of mine, and
is thus bound. By following the Discipline of Action, when the
assumed affinity is renounced, the Karmayogi becomes detached.
This detachment leads him to liberation.
' Jnanavasthitacetasah’'—He, who ever remains conscious of
"
572,"Verse 23] ~ SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 531 ;
the self, has his mind ever established in its knowledge. When

he becomes conscious of the self, he gets established in the self. .
In fact, he had already been established in the self, but he only |
now realizes the fact. -

In fact, knowledge is gained of the world, rather than of
the self, because the self is an embodiment of knowledge. The
world, consists of actions and objects. The self, being sentient,
is different from insentient actions and objects. The self is their
illuminator. As soon as, a striver realizes this fact, his affinity
for actions and objects, is renounced and he realizes, that he is, OO
naturally, established in the detached self.

'Yajfayacaratah karma samagram praviliyate'—One form of, |
‘Seeing inaction in action’, is to work for the sake of sacrifice |
(yajnia). Performance of actions for the welfare of others, without _
a selfish motive, is called ‘Yajna’, (sacrifice). He, who works
for the sake of sacrifice, gets liberated, while he, who performs
actions other than those, that are performed for the sake of 7
sacrifice, 1s bound (Gita 3/9).

Actions and objects, are the evolutes of nature (prakrti). Both -
of them have a beginning and an end, i.e., they are perishable.

They neither existed, before they were seen, nor will exist, when

they have gone. It means, that in the middle, they merely seem to
exist, but actually they do not exist, as it is a rule, that whatever

does not exist, at the beginning and at the end, also does not

exist in the middle (at present). But the self, the illuminator of

objects and action, is sentient and remains stable. Though, It has

no affinity for objects and actions, when It assumes its affinity,

for them, it is bound. The method by which to be liberated from

this bondage, is to work for the welfare of others, without having

any selfish desire for fruit.

In the world, there are innumerable objects and undertakings,
which one assumes as his own, by having attachment, desire
and a sense of mine for these he gets bound when having
"
573,"532 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4
renounced attachment, desire and a sense of mine, he renders,
service with them regarding them as of others’, all his actions :
(of past as well as present) are dissolved, and he realizes, his
natural detachment.

(1) An agent, an instrument and action, are the threefold
basis, of action (Gita 18/18). Out of the three, the real basis :
is the agent, because the instrument and the action, depend on
the agent. San

If we give a serious thought to the topic, we come to
realize, that a desire to act, arises, only when we have a desire :
to acquire something, or the other. The desire to act, makes us
an agent, or a doer. This sense of doership, binds a man. When -
a man, performs an action with the desire to acquire anything,
his sense of.doership, is strengthened. But, when a Karmayogi,
without having any desire to acquire anything, works for the sake -
of sacrifice 1.e., for the welfare of others, his doership, is utilized
for the welfare of others and he realizes, that he is detached from ;
actions and objects etc. His actions are not accumulated as in
the absence of doership, all his actions are neutralized.

In the Discipline of Action, renunciation of a sense of mine,
is important, while in the Discipline of Knowledge, renunciation
of 'egoism’', is important. If a striver, renounces one of these, the
other is automatically renounced. In the Discipline of Action, first
there is renunciation of a sense of mine and then renunciation of
egoism, naturally follows; while in the Discipline of Knowledge,
the order is reversed. In absence of ‘I'ness and ‘mineness’, the |
doership and enjoyership, both melt away.

When, a man of action, has neither a sense of doership,
nor has any desire, he has not to reap the fruit of action, in the
same way as a criminal has not to suffer torture or punishment,
if he dies. When a person, does not want to reap the fruit of
"
574,"Verse 23] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 533 :
his actions, all his actions are dissolved.
(2) In the ninth verse of this chapter, the Lord declared, :
""He who thus knows, in their true nature, My divine buth and
action, comes to Me."" The birth, can be divine only of the Lord, .
but actions of men, can also be divine. In the fourteenth verse
of this chapter, the Lord declares, that his actions are divine,
as he has no desire for the fruit of actions and thus, he is not
bound by them 1e., his actions, change into inaction. In this -
way, if a striver, also performs actions, without expecting the
fruit of actions, his actions also, change into inaction. Then, — ne
in the fifteenth verse, He declares, ""Having known this, men
who sought liberation, also performed actions.” In the sixteenth :
verse, He resolves to teach the reality about action, while in the |
seventeenth verse, He declares that one should understand the
true nature of action, of forbidden action and of inaction. In, the -
eighteenth verse, He declares, that he who see inaction in action
and action in inaction, ls wise among men. :
Desire is the known root of actions. When desire is, enhanced,
forbidden actions are performed, but when desire is renounced, .
actions are changed into inaction. The main purpose of the Lord,
is to describe inaction, (from the sixteenth to the thirty-second
verse). Therefore, He has described renunciation of desire, which
is the root of actions and forbidden actions in each of the verses :
from the nineteenth to the twenty-third, along with inaction* and
the topic has been concluded in the thirty-second verse.
* Examples of the renunciation of desires— ‘Devoid of desires’ (4/19);
“Having abandoned attachment to the fruit of action” (4/20); ""Having no hope or
desire"" (4/21); ""Satisfied with what comes to him by chance"" (4/22) and ""Devoid
of attachment” (4/23).
Examples of inaction—
""Actions have been burnt by the fire of knowledge” (4/19); "" He does
nothing thought engaged in action"" (4/20); ""While performing actions he incurs
no sin"" (4/21); ""Though acting he is not bound"" (4/22); "" The whole action is
dissolved"" (4/23).
"
575,"534 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4
Appendix—-One is ‘Kriya’, one is ‘Karma’ and one is
“Karmayoga’. The body passes from babyhood to youth and ~—

from youth to old age—this is ‘kriya’. By this ‘Kriya’ a man

neither incurs sin nor virtue, it neither leads him to salvation |

nor to bondage. Similarly the flow of the river Ganges is mere __

a ‘kriya’. If a man gets drowned in its current or it may prove

helpful in farming etc., the Ganges does not incur any sin or

virtue. When a man by assuming affinity with ‘kriya’ becomes —

a doer viz., he does ‘kriya’ for himself, then this ‘kriya’ bears

fruit and it becomes ‘Karma’ (action). Karma leads to bondage— we

‘yajnarthatkarmano’nyatra loko’ yarn karmabandhanah’ (Gita 3/9).

In order to be free from the bondage of actions, when a man |

does nothing for himself but works for the welfare of others in a

disinterested way, it is “Karmayoga’. By Karmayoga bondage for

actions is destroyed—‘yajiiayacaratah karma samagrarh praviliyate’. -

With the annihilation of bondage ‘yoga’ is attained viz., eternal

union with God is realized. 7
This twenty-third verse is the main verse of Karmayoga. As

the Lord by the expression “jnanagnih sarvakarmani bhasmasat -

_ kurute’ (Gita 4/37) has declared that the fire of knowledge reduces

all actions to ashes and by the expression ‘aharh tva sarvapapebhyo

moksayisyami ma Sucah’ (18/66) He has declared He will liberate |

a devotee from all sins, similarly in this verse He has declared

by the expression ‘yajnayacaratah karma samagrarh praviliyate’

that all the actions including past ones of a karmayogi melt away.
Link:—In the preceding verse, the Lord declared, ""All actions |

of a man, who works for the sake of sacrifice, are dissolved.""

The term ‘sacrifice’, in this context, stands for duty, according

to a person's caste and order of life etc. Therefore, the Lord,

in the next seven verses, explains several forms of sacrifice as

duties, for the strivers, according to their inclination, faith and

qualification. —

By God, as offeror of sacrifice, is the oblation poured into the fire ~
of God. God shall be attained by him who is absorbed in God, in |

Comment:—
{Oblation, is important in sacrifice. The oblation becomes one .
with fire, when it is poured into fire, it has no separate existence
of its own. Similarly, when all the means of God-realization, |
have no existence apart from God, these become sacrifice. -
To perceive, God in all sacrifices, is to see reality, as it is
not a conception. Actually objects are not real, and to visualize -
these as real, is an error. |
All, the sacrifices described, from the twenty-fourth verse .
to the thirtieth verse, are included in 'Karmayoga’, because the
Lord at the beginning of this context, declared, ""I shall teach
thee, what action is (the nature of action and inaction), knowing =
which, thou shalt be delivered from evil"" (4/16). At the end, He
declared, ""Know all sacrifices as born of action, and thus knowing,
thou shalt be liberated"" (4/32). In the middle, also He declared,
“To one who works for the sake of sacrifice, the whole action
is dissolved"" (4/23). The important factor, is that all actions
of a person, who performs them for the sake of sacrifice, are
changed into inaction. Therefore, in all these sacrifices, there is
a description of, inaction in action.] :
‘Brahmarpanam brahma havih’—The ladle, with which an
oblation is poured into the fire, has been called 'arpanam'—
that is God.
"

Sesame seed, barley and ghee, which are poured as oblation _

so ‘Brahmagnau brahmand hutam'—He, who performs the. —

poured, is God and the act of pouring oblation, is also God.

""Brahmakarmasamadhina—Just as person while offering

Cultured people, recite this verse while having meals, so that
this activity may be changed into a sacrifice (yajia). When a= -
striver has his meal, he beholds God, in the following way:—

(1) The hand, with which the food is put into the mouth, isGod.
""With hands and feet everywhere, He exists"" (Gita 13/3).

(11) The food is God. ""I am the melted butter"" (Gita 9/16).

_ (iii) He who eats the food, is also God. ""The soul is a
fragment of Mine"" (Gita 15/7).

(iv) The fire, that abides in the stomach, and by which food
is digested, is also God. ""I am the fire, lodged in the body of
all creatures"" (Gita 15/14). .

(v) The action of offering food, to the fire, which abides in
the stomach, is also God. ""I am the offering"" (Gita 9/16).

(vi) The fruit of eating, the remnants, (residual food) of the
sacrifice, is also God. ""Those who eat the sacred food that remains,
after a sacrifice, attain to the eternal Absolute"" (4/31).

The world, which is an evolute of nature (prakrti), is in
fact, seen in the form of objects and actions. The world, in the
"
578,"Verse 25} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 537 :
form of objects and actions is ever-changing and ever undergoes
modifications. But, due to attachment, we do not perceive the
changing nature, of objects; we perceive these chiefly, as objects.
All objects and activities are going to naught. Therefore, the -
world is practically, a naught. There is existence, only of the
transcendental Absolute. In fact the world does not exist, but it ,
seems to exist, in the light of the eternal Absolute. The non-
existence of the world is explained below— a ;
The world appears in three states—birth, life and death.

Some Yogis offer sacrifice to God alone; while others offer
the self as sacrifice by the sacrifice of discrimination in the fire
of the Supreme. 25
Comment:—
'Daivamevapare yajiiam yoginah paryupasate'—In the
preceding verse, the Lord described, a striver who beholds God,
"
579,"538 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4
in all objects and actions. Here, by using the term ‘apare' He

: describes strivers, who perform sacrifice, but who are different ;
from those mentioned, in the preceding verse.

Here the term 'Yoginah’, stands for those strivers, who -
perform actions, without expecting any reward. .
Those who instead of regarding actions and objects as theirs
and for them, regard these as the Lord's and for Him, perform = _
sacrifice to God, as He is the Lord, even of the gods. Therefore, :
those persons who, without having the least attachment, a sense j |

of mine and desire for objects and actions, hold that they are
only of the Lord, perform sacrifice to Him.

""Brahmagnavapare yajiiam yajiienaivopajuhvati'—The term
‘apare’, has been used, to bring out the distinction between sacrifice
mentioned in the first half of this verse, and the second half. -

When, the soul identifies Itself with matter, It becomes an
embodied soul. But when a person (the soul), by discrimination, _
having a total disinclination for matter, merges in God i.e., has not
the least separate existence, apart from God, it is called sacrifice.

Appendix—The expression ‘brahmagnavapare yajfiamn
yajnenaivopajuhvati’ may also mean other Yogis in order to
serve Brahma—the embodied world perform duty sacrifice for
the sacrifice in the form of welfare of others viz., they perform |
all actions for the welfare of others (Gita 3/9, 4/23).

Some offer hearing and other senses, as sacrifice into the fire
of restraint; others offer sound and other objects of senses into
the fire of senses. 26
"
580,"Verse 27] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 539 -
Comment:—

Srotradinindriyanyanye sarnyamagnisu juhvati'—Here, the offer
of senses, into the fires of restraint has been called, sacrifice. It
means that some do not allow the senses—ear, eye, skin, tongue, /
and nose, to incline towards the sensual objects of sound, sight,
touch, taste and smell. They constantly restrain their senses.

The senses, the mind, the intellect and the ego, are said to
be under complete restraint, when these are totally free, from
attachment (Gita 2/58-59, 68). 7

'Sabdadinvisayananya indriyagnisu juhvati'—Sound, sight,
touch, taste and smell, are the five sensual objects. The discipline
in which these objects of sense, are offered in the fire of sense,
becomes a sacrifice. It means, that even when the objects of :
senses, come in contact with senses, the senses remain free from -
attraction and repulsion, or attachment and aversion (Gita 2/64-65).

In both the sacrifices, mentioned in this verse, perfection ;
or God-realization, is attained, when there is total absence of
attachment. This process, of two kinds as sacrifice, has been
described, in order to root out attachment. -

In the first one, a striver controls his senses in solitude,
through discrimination, chant and meditation etc. When there is full
restraint, he becomes, free from attachment and then he remains 7
equable, both in loneliness, as well as in practical life.

In the second case, a striver in his practical life, moves about
among sense-objects with the mind, intellect and ego and the
senses, free from attraction and repulsion i.e., attachment and
aversion. When he becomes free from attachment, he remains
the same, both in loneliness and practical life.

Some others again, offer sacrifice with the functions of the

senses and those of the breath (vital energy), into the fire of Yoga

of self restraint, kindled by knowledge. 27 : |

Comment:—

'‘Sarvanindriyakarmani pranakarmani capare'—In this verse,

a trance (concentration of the mind on God or the self), has

been called a form of sacrifice. It means, that in the state of

trance, when the Yogi concentrates his mind on God, his senses = =

(sense-organs and organs of action), cease to function, these

become calm.

When a Yogi concentrates his mind on God, the function

of the breath, is offered (sacrificed) 1.e., the breath also ceases _

to function. In the state of trance, breath ceases to function, in

two ways—the first, is by breath-control, in which breath is

suspended. By practice, it can be suspended for hours and thenfor —-

days, together. By this process of restraining breath, the duration

of life is lengthened, in the same way, as the age of a frog is __

lengthened. When it rains, sand also flows with water. A frog 1s

embedded by that sand. When the sand dries, the frog remains
there and its breath ceases to function. But when it rains again
next year, in the rainy season, it comes back to life.

In the second way, the mind is concentrated on God or

the self, and when the mind is totally concentrated, breathing

automatically stops. :

' Jiianadipite'—Both, the trance and sleep, have their affinity

for the causal body. Therefore, both of these appear to be of

the same state. Here, by the expression “jnanadipite (kindled by

knowledge), the Lord explains, that there is a vast difference

between the two. In the state of trance, the knowledge that God
pervades everywhere, remains kindled, while during slumber all

his inclinations merge 1n ignorance. During trance, breath ceases

to function while during slumber, breath functions. In slumber,
no trance is possible. | -
‘Atmasarhyamayogagnau juhvati'—The Yogis, who
concentrate their mind, sacrifice all the functions of senses and -
those of the breath, into the fire of the Yoga of self-restraint i.e., :
having suspended the function, of all the senses, breath, mind
and intellect, they get fixed in trance. In that state, all senses
and breath cease to function and the consciousness of God who -
is All Truth-Knowledge-Bliss, remains fully awakened.

eulogized, in the scriptures. The aim of these vows is, to enable
a man to have disinclination for the world. The expression
‘SarmnSitavratah’ (persons of rigid vows), has been used for the
strivers, who fulfil these vows. Besides them, other strivers who
perform the vows of the four other kinds of sacrifice, mentioned
in the verse, are also persons of rigid vows. They have been
called 'Yatayah' (persons of self-restraint), because they having
self-restraint, make efforts, in performing the sacrifice of their
own choice and taste. |

the welfare of others, without any selfish motive, by regarding

sacrifice, a man does not need to use anything more, than what

he actually possesses. As a person, expects a child to perform, |

only the action which he is capable of performing, so does the

omniscient Lord, and the world expect us to perform sacrifice, _

which we are capable of performing. : |
'Tapoyajiiah'—'Tapoyajnah' (austerity as sacrifice), consists in

facing difficult and unfavourable circumstances, happily. Observing 7

fast and keeping mum, etc., are also austerities, as sacrifice. But,.

the best sacrifice, consists in the performance of one's duty happily,

even in the most unfavourable circumstances,without the least

deviation from it. Such austerity, proves fruitful quickly. :
Rubbish may be harmful for health, but it works as a manure in

farming. Similarly, unfavourable circumstances, work as austerity,

if the striver faces these happily. A man feels happy in favourable

circumstances and feels unhappy in unfavorable circumstances,

because of his attachment to pleasure. If he is not attached to

pleasure, he can understand, the merit of unfavourable circumstances. :
""Yogayajiiastathapare'—Here, the term ‘Yoga’, stands for

equanimity. Evenness of mind in success and failure, praise and

blame, honour and dishonour and pleasure and pain, is called

""Yogayajiia’ (Yoga as sacrifice). In this sacrifice, a striver has

neither attachment for favourable circumstances, nor aversion

for unfavourable circumstances.
"
584,"Verse 29-30] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 543
'Svadhyayajiianayajiiah'—Study of the scriptures, such as the
Gita, the Ramayana, the Bhagavata, the Vedas and the Upanisad
etc., as well as, the study of one’s own self and inclinations—all
constitute, the holy sacrifice of knowledge. :
The Lord, while explaining the merit of the study of Gita
declares, ""He who studies this sacred dialogue (the Gita) of :
ours, by him, I would be worshipped through the sacrifice of .
knowledge"" (Gita 18/70). It means, that the study of Gita is :
a sacrifice of knowledge. He, who is lost in reflection, of the _
gospel of the Gita and makes efforts to understand it, performs ee
the sacrifice of knowledge.

Others offer as sacrifice (yajiia), the outgoing breath in the

breaths (pranayama). Others who regulate their diet, could offer
the breath of life to the vital air (prana). All these are knowers
of yajiia and by that have their sins destroyed. 29-30
Comment:—
‘Apane juhvati pranam prane'panam tathapare pranapanagati
ruddhva pranayamaparayanah'*—Heart is the abode of outgoing
* In this verse is one subject, ‘others’ and one verb, ‘sacrifice’ therefore, here
restraint of birth includes inhalation, retention and exhalation of breath.
"
585,"544 , SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4
breath, while the seat of incoming breath, is anus. The Yogis, -
practise inhalation through the left nostril. That air having taken
the life-air which abides in the heart with it, passing through the |
navel merges with the incoming breath. This is called 'Puraka’ :
(Inhalation). When the outgoing and the incoming breaths, are
restrained, it is called 'Kumbhaka’' (retention of breath). After
that, the air from inside is exhaled through the right nostril. .
That air, having taken the outgoing and the incoming breaths, is
exhaled. This is, sacrifice of the outgoing breath, in the incoming
breath. It is called 'recaka' (exhalation). Inhalation is practised OO
by uttering the name of the Lord four times, while retention, of
breath is practised by uttering the same name, sixteen times, and
exhalation, is practised by uttering the same name eight times.
Thus Yogis, through the left nostril, practise inhalation, -
retention of breath and exhalation and then, through the right
nostril practise inhalation, retention of breath and exhalation.
Repetition of this process, is known as the sacrifice of restraint of -
the breath. When restraint of breath is practised, in order to attain
God, without expecting any other reward, all sins perish. -
‘Apare niyataharah prananpranesu juhvati'—Only those
strivers, who regulate their diet can offer as sacrifice their
life-breaths (prana) for life-breaths. He who eats too much or ,
abstains too much from eating, cannot practise this restraint, of
breath (Gita 6/16-17). oo :
The sacrifice of life-breaths (prana) by life-breaths means,
sacrifice of the incoming breath into the incoming breath and
of the outgoing breath, into the outgoing breath, 1e., the acts
of inhalation and exhalation, both are suspended. This is called
‘Stambhavrtti pranayama’ (absolute restraint of the breath). Through
this restraint of the breath, passions are naturally controlled and
sins are destroyed. When this sacrifice is practised, with the aim
of God-realization, it leads to the purification of the mind and
then to God-realization. :
"
586,"Verse 29-30] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 545 -

'‘Sarve'pyete yajiiavido yajiiaksapitakalmasah'—The expression
‘sarve'pyete’ (all these), has been used for those strivers, who ""
perform sacrifice (duties), as described from the twenty-fourth
verse to the first half of the thirtieth verse. Performance of
these sacrifices, destroys their sins, and leads them to god- -
realization. |

In fact all sacrifices aim at the renunciation of affinity, for
actions. Those, who know this fact, are the real knowers of -
sacrifice. When affinity for actions, is totally renounced, God is
realized. Those who perform sacrifice, instead, for God-realization, nnn
for acquiring pleasure here as well as hereafter, do not know, the
reality about sacrifice. It is desire for the perishable pleasures, :
which leads to bondage. The Lord declares, ""Those who seek
worldly enjoyment repeatedly go and return"" (Gita 9/21). Therefore, -
those who perform, even great sacrifices with worldly desires,
have to follow the bondage, of birth and death. :

|

During sacrifice, oblation is offered into fire. The oblation has ;
different shapes, It loses its identity and becomes one with the fire.
Similarly, when all the means of God-realization, which have been
described here as sacrifice, are offered to God, these lose their /
identity, and become one with God. If these retain their separate
existence, it means, that they have not been offered, as sacrifice.

The Lord, started this topic of the reality of actions, (seeing
inaction in action), from the sixteenth verse. The reality about
actions is, that he who performs actions as sacrifice i.e., for
the welfare of others, is not bound by them. As everything put
into fire is burnt to ashes, so are actions, which are performed
for the sake of sacrifice, dissolved entirely i.e., are reduced to
nothing (Gita 4/23).

Day to day actions, performed for the welfare of others, without
any selfish motive, lead to God-realization. But, even virtuous
"
587,"5.46 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA - {Chapter4 -

actions, performed with a selfish motive (with the expectation
of their fruits) cannot lead to God-realization, because it is a -
desire for the perishable, which binds a man. So long as, he
assumes his affinity for the world,.1in the form of its materials
and actions, he has attachment to acquire something and to do .
something. This attachment, is called a desire to acquire and
an ‘urge to act’. |

In fact, the real desire (need) of a man is, to attain God whose -
fragment, he is. But, he wants to satisfy this need by acquiring
worldly objects because of his inclination for the world and Tn enn
disinclination for God. How can, the perishable objects satisfy the
imperishable fragment (the self) of the Lord? So long as, he has
an inclination for the world, he has a desire to acquire something
or the other. In order to, acquire it, he has to act. Thus, so long |
as, he has a desire to acquire and an urge to act viz., he has -
affinity with materials and actions, he has to follow, the cycle
of birth and death. How to get liberated from this cycle? One -
can be liberated from, this cycle of birth and death, when one
performs actions for the welfare of others, without having any
desire. This is called sacrifice or an ideal for others, or actions :
for the welfare of others.

When actions, are performed for the welfare of others, the -
affinity for the world is renounced, and a man gets detached
from these. If actions are performed for the sake of the Lord,a
striver's affinity, for the world is renounced, he gets detached from
actions, and he attains devotion to God which is an uncommon
trait, of a striver.

Appendix—Performance of actions without any selfish motive,
only for the welfare of others is called ‘yajfia’ (sacrifice). By
sacrifice all actions are transformed into inaction viz., they don’t
lead to bondage. There is mention of twelve kinds of sacrifice
from the twenty-fourth verse to the thirtieth verse and they are
as follows— .
"
588,"Verse 29-30] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 547

(i) Brahmayajna—Realizing the doer, the action, the
instrument and object etc., in every action as Brahma. -

(ii) Bhagavadarpanarupa yajiia—Assuming all actions and
objects only God’s and only for Him. | |

(iii) Abhinnataripa yajfia—Having total disinclination for :
the unreal, merger in God viz., having no independent existence
of one’s own apart from God.

[Kartavya-karmaripa yajfia—performance of all actions for -
the welfare of others. ]

(iv) Sathyamarupa yajna—In loneliness not to allow the OO
senses to incline mentally towards the sensual objects.

(v) Visaya-havanarupa yajiia—tIn day to day life to keep the |

senses free from attachment and aversion even when the senses
come in contact with sense-objects (Gita 2/64-65). _

(vi) Samadhirupa yajiia—By restraining all the functions
of the senses and breath to get established in trance kindled by |
knowledge. | :

(vii) Dravya yajiia—Utilization of all materials for the service
of others in a selfless spirit. -

(viii) Tapoyajiia—Facing difficulties happily while discharging
one’s duty. |

(ix) Yogayajfiia—To remain equanimous in success and |
failure, in favourable and unfavourable circumstances. |

(x) Svadhyayarupa jnanayajia—Study of the sacred
scriptures and chanting the Lord’s holy names etc., for the
good of others.

(x1) Pranayamaripa yajia—Control of breaths by ‘puraka’
(inhalation), ‘Kumbhaka’ (retention) and ‘recaka’ (exhalation).

(xii) Stambhavrtti (fourth) pranayamaripa yajna—By
regulating the diet, suspension of the acts of inhalation and
exhalation. | |

All these mean that all our actions should be performed
"
589,"548 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4
in the form of sacrifice and then our life will be successful. It |
means that we have to do nothing for ourselves. We have no -
affinity for actions and objects. We have relationship with God

Who is devoid of actions and objects. |

Link:—The Lord, from the twenty-fourth verse to the first half
of the thirtieth verse, described twelve kinds of sacrifice, while -
in the second half of the thirtieth verse, He eulogized strivers ,
who perform sacrifices. Now, He in the next verse, explains what
is gained, through their performance and what is lost through ee
their non-performance.

yajnhasistamrtabhujo yanti brahma_  sanatanam

nayam loko'styayajiiasya kuto'nyah kurusattama

Those who partake sacred remnants after a sacrifice (yajna),
attain to the eternal Absolute; even this world is not pleasant for
him who performs no sacrifice; how then can he have happiness -
in any other world, O Best of the Kurus (Arjuna)? 31
Comment:—

'Yajiiasistamrtabhujo yanti brahma sanatanam'—Those, ;
who realize equanimity, having performed sacrifice 1.e., having
performed duty without any selfish motive, are said to have taken
the remnants of the sacrifice. Such people, are released from all
sins, and attain to the eternal Absolute (Gita 3/13).

A man (the self), is eternal. It 1s because of his attachment
to the perishable, that he believes that he dies. When he, having
utilized his so-called possessions, for the welfare of the world, gets
detached from them, he realizes the fact, that he is eternal.

When action is performed as duty i.e., for the welfare of
others without any selfish motive, it becomes a sacrifice (yajna).
"
590,"Verse 32] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 549 -
Action performed, with a selfish motive leads to bondage. In a
sacrifice all possessions offered to others; for his own-self, he ""
performs only action, which is inevitable for the bare maintenance
of body (Gita 4/21). Such an action, is also included in sacrifice.
This human body has been bestowed upon us, so that we may -
perform sacrifice. If we use it, in order to gain honour, praise,
comforts and luxuries etc., it leads us to bondage. But, if with
it, actions are performed only for the sake of sacrifice, it leads
to liberation and one attains to the Eternal Absolute. |

‘Nayam loko'styayajiiasya kuto'nyah kurusattama'—In the een
eighth verse of the third chapter, the Lord declared, ""Even the
maintenance of the body would not be possible by inaction."" :
Similarly, here He declares, ""This world 1s not felicitous for him who
performs no sacrifice, how then can he have happiness in, any other |
world?"" He, who performs actions, with a selfish motive disturbs -

_ peace, causes disorder and strife, and does not attain salvation.

A selfish member, who does not perform his duty, is not
liked even by members of one's family. Non-performance of
duty, causes quarrels, strifes and annoyance in the family. He
who wants to lead a peaceful life in the family, should perform
his duty by rendering service to other members of the family.
By doing so, he becomes a source of inspiration for others and
thus unity and peace prevail, in the family and in the world, :
here as well as hereafter. On the other hand, he who does not
perform his duty scrupulously, does not lead a happy life, here
as well as hereafter.

Thus, many forms of sacrifice have been described in

detail in the Vedas. Know them all as born of action and

having known these as such thou shalt be liberated from the -

bondage of action. 32

Comment:—

'Evamn bahuvidha yajiia vitata brahmano mukhe'—Besides, the
' twelve forms of sacrifice, which have been described, from the

twenty-fourth verse to the thirtieth verse, there are many other ~ :

forms of sacrifice, which have been explained in detail, in the

Vedas. The reason is, that according to their inclination, nature :

and faith, strivers, follow different spiritual disciplines. —

In the Vedas, there is description of self-centred rituals _
which people perform, in order to reap their perishable fruit.

So, they go to heaven and enjoy divine pleasures of the gods,

there. But, having enjoyed them, when fruits of their virtuous -

deeds are exhausted, they return to the world of mortals, and

these follow, the cycle of birth and death (Git& 9/21). Self- .

centred rituals, are not enunciated here. But, here 1s an outline

of selfless sacrifice, by performing which a striver attains to the

Eternal Absolute (Gita 4/31). | |
In the Vedas, there is not only the description of the means |

of enjoying heavenly pleasures, but there is also reference to |

spiritual practice, such as hearing of Vedic texts, cognition

(reflection on what is heard), constant musing (constant and

profound meditation), restraint of breath and trance (super

conscious state), as the means of God-realization. These have

been mentioned here, in this verse. |
In the fourteenth and the fifteenth verses of the third

chapter, the Lord declares, ""Sacrifice is born of the Veda, and

the omnipresent God, ever abides in sacrifice we should resort

to such sacrifice, only for God-realization.""
"
592,"Verse 32] _ SADHAKA-SANJIVANT 551
'Karmajanviddhi tansarvan'—The expression, 'tansarvan’ (the .

all) has been used, for all the twelve sacrifices, described from

the twenty-fourth to the thirtieth verse here, as well as, different

forms of sacrifice described in the Vedas. -
The expression 'Karmajanviddhi' (born of action) means, that

all forms of sacrifice are born of actions. Activities undertaken

with the body, words uttered with the mouth and thoughts of the

mind, are all included, in actions. The Lord declares, ""Whatever |

action a man performs, that is undertaken by the body, speech ee

or mind” (Gita 18/15). :
Arjuna, wants to attain salvation, but he wants to renounce .

his duty of fighting, by regarding it, as a sin. Therefore, the -

Lord by using the expression 'Karmajanviddhi', explains to him,

that whatever spiritual practice he will do by renouncing war, ~

will also be, the performance of action. The Lord declares, that

it is not action, but total renunciation of affinity for actions, -

which leads to salvation. Therefore, he should perform his duty

of fighting, remaining detached from actions, in order to attain

salvation, because it is not actions but it is attachment to them, :

which binds him (Gita 6/4). It is also easy for him to perform

the duty of fighting, because it is his natural or innate duty

(specific duty). | -
'Evarn jiiatva vimoksyase'—-The Lord, in the fourteenth

verse of this chapter, declared, ""I have no desire for the fruit

of actions. So actions do not bind me. He who knows Me thus,

is not bound by actions."" It means, that he who has learnt the

art of remaining detached from actions, while performing these

and translates it into practice, gets liberated from the bondage

of actions. The same fact, has been pointed out by the Lord,

- in the fifteenth verse, when He declares, ""Having known thus,

the actions were performed by those ancient men, who sought

liberation."" In the sixteenth verse, He promised to explain the true

nature of action and inaction, by knowing which, he would be
"
593,"552 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4
liberated from the cycle of birth and death. In the present verse, -
He concludes the topic, by declaring that, having known thus,
he will be liberated. It means, that when a person performs his
duty, only for the welfare of the world. without expecting any -
_ fruit, he is liberated from the bondage of actions.
In the world, innumerable actions are performed, but a man
is bound only by those with which he establishes his affinity. By
having this affinity, he gets pleased or displeased, and thus he is sy
bound by those actions. But when he renounces his affinity, for
the body and actions, he is liberated, from the bondage of actions. SO

has a curiosity to know which one of the sacrifices is superior to

Knowledge, as a sacrifice (yajiia) is superior to any material
sacrifice, O harasser of the foes (Arjuna). All actions and objects
in their entirety, culminate in knowledge (jfiana). 33 :
Comment:— a |
'Sreyandravyamayadyajiiajjiianayajiiah parantapa'— Sacrifices,
which require material objects and actions, are called ‘Dravyamaya’.
The suffix ‘Maya’ with the term 'Dravya’, denotes large quantity. |
As with the preponderance of earth the earthenpot is called 744
so with the preponderance of material the sacrifice is called
material sacrifice. Knowledge as a sacrifice, is superior to any
material sacrifice, because in knowledge-sacrifice, there is no
need for material objects and actions.
The Lord, declares that all sacrifices are born of
"
594,"Verse 33] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 553 .
action (4/32). But here He declares, that all actions culminate
in knowledge i.., knowledge as a sacrifice, is not born of -
actions but is born of discrimination. Therefore, knowledge, as a
Sacrifice, mentioned here, does not stand for knowledge, as ;
sacrifice (described in 4/28). It stands for the process of acquiring :
knowledge from teachers, who are well-versed in the scriptures,
as will be described in the thirty-fourth verse. Material sacrifice,
described here, stands for the twelve forms of sacrifice already :
described. Having performed material sacrifice, the knowledge-
sacrifice, 1s offered. If we consider minutely, we come to know TO
_ that knowledge-sacrifice is also born of actions, but in knowledge-
sacrifice, there is predominance of discrimination.
‘Sarvam karmakhilam. partha jane parisamapyate'—The
terms 'sarvam' and ‘akhilam’, both are synonyms. Therefore, the _
expression ‘Sarvarn karma’ should mean, all actions, while the
word '‘akhilam' would stand for, all material objects. | :
So long as, a man performs actions for himself, he has affinity -
for them, and consequently his mind remains impure. But, when
he does not perform them for himself, his mind is purified. .
The mind is tainted by three kinds of defects—sins, volatility
of mind, and ignorance. When a striver performs actions, for
the welfare of others without any selfish motive, his first two
defects i.e., sins and volatility of mind, come to an end. In order a
to get rid of the third defect, having renounced actions, he goes
to his preceptor, so that he may impart knowledge, to him. At
that time, he does not aim at actions and material objects, but
his aim is God-realization. This is known, as culmination of all
actions and material objects, in knowledge 1.e., God-realization
through the attainment of true knowledge.
In the scriptures, there are eight inward spiritual means to
attain knowledge. These are —(1) Discrimination. (2) Dispassion. .
"
595,"554 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4 -
(3) Six traits (Quietism, self-control, piety, indifference, endurance |
and composure). (4) Desire to attain salvation. (5) Listening to -
Vedantic texts. (6) Cognition. (7) Constant and deep meditation.
(8) Self-realization. : ,

Discrimination (viveka), consists in distinguishing, the
real from the unreal. Renunciation of the unreal or having a
disinclination for the world is called dispassion (vairadgya).
Deviation of the mind from the sense object is quietism (Sama). -
Control over the senses is 'dama'. Reverence for God and the
scriptures is called 'piety' (Sraddha). Total resignation from the oe ean
world, is 'Uparati’. Forbearance in the pairs of opposites such as heat
and cold, is endurance (Titiksa). Freedom from doubt is composure :
(Samadhana). The desire for salvation, is called 'Mumuksuta.

When desire for salvation, is aroused, a striver having -

renounced material objects and actions, goes to a learned God-

realized preceptor. He hears the Vedantic texts, which remove his
doubts, which is known as hearing ( Sravana). Then, he thinks -
of the reality, about God which is known cognition (Manana).
If he holds that the world is real and God does not exist— this ;
is an Opposite conception. Removal of this contrary conception,
is called constant and profound meditation (Nididhyasana).
When, having renounced affinity for all material objects, one ;
gets established in the self, it is called self-realization (tattvarh
padartha sarnsodhana).* |

In fact, all these spiritual disciplines are practised, in order
to renounce the affinity for the unreal. That which is renounced,
is not for one's own self, but the result of renunciation (God-
realization), is for one's own self.

Appendix—In ‘Dravyamaya yajia’ (material sacrifice),
there is predominance of material objects and actions; therefore

* Those who hanker after worldly pleasures and prosperity hear the Vedantic
texts, think over the sense-objects, have a constant and profound meditation on
riches and attain pains and sorrows.
"
596,"Verse 34] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 555

it is “Karana sapeksa’ (dependent on sense & other organs).

In Jianayajiia (Knowledge-sacrifice) there is predominance of -

discrimination. Therefore it is ‘Karana nirapeksa (independent

of sense and other organs). Therefore knowledge as sacrifice .

is superior to material sacrifice. In Jiianayajiia, affinity for all

actions and objects is renounced viz., after God-realization nothing

remains to be done, to be known and to be attained because no

other existence remains except God. /

Comment:—
'Tadviddhi'—Arjuna, in the beginning declared, ""I don't foresee

any good by slaying my own people, in the fight"" (Gita 1/31)

and ""Only sin will accrue to us, if we kill these malignants""

(Gita 1/36). He also declared, ""It is better to live in this

world, even by begging, than to slay these honoured teachers""

(Gita 2/5). Thus, according to Arjuna, it 1s better to renounce

fighting, which is his duty, rather than to fight. But, according

to Lord Krsna, it is not necessary to renounce actions in order

to gain knowledge (wisdom) (Gita 3/20; 4/15). Therefore, it

seems that the Lord, warns Arjuna that if he, because of his
"
597,"556 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4 -
lack of faith in Him, does not believe in what He preaches, he
should go to a wise preceptor, who has realized the truth and -
he would impart him the knowledge of self-realization, through
the traditional practice of knowledge.*
The Lord further, in the thirty-eighth verse, declares, ""Through :
the constant practice of the Discipline of Action, a striver without
any other spiritual practice, attains the knowledge of the self.
He needs no help from others. .
'‘Pranipatena'—He should go to a teacher, with profound
humility and perfect devotion, and through prostration surrender BO
himself, his body and possessions etc., to him. He should be
very submissive and very cautious, that in no way disrespect :
is meted out to a preceptor. He should keep his inquisitiveness
always, awake. -
'Sevaya'—He should render service to his preceptor, with
his body and objects and try to please him, by carrying out his
orders and acting, according to his wish. -
A striver, renders the greatest service to the saints (great
souls) by translating their principles into practice, because their -
principles are more dear to them, than even their bodies. They
remain prepared to sacrifice their life, in order to protect their
principles. :
‘Pariprasnena'—A_ striver, should ask questions of his
preceptor, with inquisitiveness, simplicity and humility, in order
to know the reality about God, rather than to display his own
learning or to put his preceptor on test. He should put such
* First of all having performed his duty according to his caste and order of
life scrupulously, aman having purified his mind should renounce the performance
of actions. After that having possessed the traits such as quietism and self-control
etc., he should go to the God-realized preceptor in order to attain the knowledge
of Self-realization.
In order to gain that knowledge the inquisitive striver, having taken the
fuel used in a sacrifice, with profound humility, should go to the God-realized
preceptor who is well-versed in the scriptures.
"
598,"Verse 34] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 557 _
questions, ""Who am I?"" What is the world? What is the cause
of bondage? What is salvation? How can I realize God? What .
are the obstacles to my spiritual practice? How to do away, with
these obstacles? Why am I unable to understand this topic of
God-realization?"" Thus, he should satisfy his curiosity and gain -
knowledge from his preceptor.

'Jnaninastattvadarsinah'—The expression ""Tattvadarsinah’,
stands for the seers of truth, who have realized God, while the |
term, 'Jnaninah' stands for the wise, who are well-versed in the
Vedas and the scriptures. A striver, should go to such a wise | |
seer, and acquire knowledge from him. |

In regard to, the purification of mind, there are three kinds of
strivers, who are qualified to gain that knowledge—the superior,
the mediocre and the inferior. The superior ones, are those who 7
attain knowledge of the self, merely by listening to Vedantic ~
texts.* The mediocre ones, attain this knowledge by hearing,
cognition, constant and deep meditation. The inferior ones, have
several doubts. In order to, clarify those doubts it is necessary, ;
to possess knowledge of the Vedas and the scriptures. Without
possessing knowledge, even such a preceptor who has realized ”
the truth, cannot clarify the doubts of his disciples. Similarly,
even a learned preceptor, who has not realized the truth, cannot
lead his disciple, to Self-realization. Therefore, a preceptor should |
be, one who is wise and who has _ realized, the truth.

‘Upadeksyanti te jianam'—By obeisance, by service and by
asking questions with profound humility, a striver will be able
to gain knowledge from the preceptor, as the latter is specially
inspired, to impart true knowledge in view of the disciple's ,
profound humility and perfect devotion. It does not mean, that
a high-souled man, expects these, but without humility and
devotion, the striver will not be able to gain that knowledge.

* The superior ones are those who have a burning desire to realize the Truth
at once.
"
599,"558 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4 ~
‘Here, the term ‘Jianam' stands for Truth-realization, or _
Self-realization. In fact a striver, does not gain knowledge ~-
about the self, but he gains it about the world. When a striver,
comes to know the truth about the unreal world, his affinity
for the world is renounced and he realizes the self, which is —
self-evident. |
The term 'Upadeksyanti' (instruct) means, that the great souls
instruct a striver, but it is not necessary that he should attain
self-realization. The reason is, that faith is a trait of the heart. A
man may prostrate, question and serve, hypocritically. Further, -
in the thirty-ninth verse, He declares, ""The man who has faith,
gains knowledge (wisdom)'. Therefore, here it 1s mentioned,
that the wise will instruct him, in that knowledge, while in the
thirty-ninth verse, it is mentioned that a man, who has faith, _
gains knowledge. Oo

glory of Self-realization. |

Comment:—
'Yajjiiatva na. punarmohamevam yasyasi pandava'—The
Lord, in the preceding verse, said, ‘The wise will instruct thee
in (that) knowledge.” But, merely by listening, a man does not |
"
600,"Verse 35] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 559 -
realize, the self. The Lord declares, ""Even after hearing, no one |
understands, the self"" (Gita 2/29) because, the self, is beyond -
the access of mind and speech etc. The self, can be realized by
the self, when a striver attaches importance, to discrimination.
When he attaches importance, to discrimination, ignorance totally -
perishes and discrimination changes, into self-realization. And
affinity is totally renounced, for the insentient. Then one never
gets deluded. ,
In the first chapter of the Gita, Arjuna gets deluded, when he
believes that it his kinsmen are killed in the battle, no one will : Bo.
remain alive to offer them water and rice offering. So, they would
go to hell. Moreover, it would be difficult for living women and
children, to earn their living, in order to maintain their bodies.
Having realized the self, a striver does not get deluded like this,
because his affinity for the world, is totally renounced. ~
""Yena bhitanyaSesena draksyasyatmani'— When he realizes
the self, he sees all beings (infinite universes), in the self. As a -
person, having awaken from sleep sees the entire creation of his
dream, in him, so does a striver, having realized the self, see all
beings, in the self. The same fact, has been pointed out by the
Lord, in the twenty-ninth verse of the sixth chapter, when He
declares, ""A Yogi sees all beings as assumed in the self.""
""Atho mayi'—A striver, having gained knowledge of the self,
by hearing, cognition constant and deep meditation etc., or from
the preceptor, sees all beings in the self—this is the realization
of 'Tvam' (self-realization). Then he sees all beings and the self
in God—this is realization of ""Tat' (God-realization). Thus, he
realizes the identity of the self with God, and, then nothing :
remains for him, except God. The trio, of the seer, the sight, and
the seen, gets extinct. When this trio gets lost, there remains, no
perceiver. Therefore, the expression, ‘he perceives’, refers to the
feeling prevailing in the inner sense of that perfect soul.
The sea and its waves, may seem different but both of these
"
601,"560 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4  ~
are, one and the same—both of these are nothing but water.
The sea and the. waves, are limited while the element, water, ~
is unlimited. Therefore, he who sees water in both the sea and
the waves, sees reality. As are the sea and its waves, so are the
world and the body. As waves appear and disappear in the sea,
so are bodies born and these perish, in the world. But, both: of
these have no independent existence of their own, only God
| has independent existence. In God, there is, neither world nor
body. These seem to exist because of the existence of God. Both
the body and the world because of their affinity for nature, are —
limited, while God is limitless. He who, instead of seeing the
world and bodies, perceives the Supreme Lord existing equally __.
in all beings, notices reality (Gita 13/27). oo
Appendix—Self-realization or destruction of ignorance takes
place only once and forever. It means that there is no repetition _
of Self-realization. The self once realized is realized forever.
The reason is that when ignorance has no independent existence, —_
then how will ignorance prevail? We are freed from ignorance
because we are ever free from it and the self is realized because
it is ever realized. : | |
The self is existence and knowledge itself. By disregarding
Knowledge itself we have accepted the unreal and by accepting
the unreal, indiscrimination overwhelms. It means that turning
away from knowledge itself we accept the existence of the unreal
and by accepting the existence of the unreal, discrimination 1s
neglected. In fact knowledge itself has not been disrespected, but
its disregard has been from time immemonial. If we assume that we
have disrespected knowledge, it shows that first we had knowledge.
Therefore if we respect it now, again it may be neglected. But
the knowledge is attained only once and forever.
After self-realization one is never deluded because in fact
delusion has no existence. Only the non-existent perishes and
only the ever existent is attained. :
"
602,"Verse 36] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 561 -
The universe is within the sphere of the embodied self and the .
embodied self is within the sphere of the Supreme Soul, therefore -
a striver sees the universe in himself ‘draksyasyatmani’ and then
he sees the self in God—‘atho mayi’. In ‘draksyasyatmani’ there
is Self-realization (Jiiana viz., knowledge) and in ‘atho mayi’ ~
there is God-realization (Vijnana). In Self-realization there is bliss
of the self while in God-realization there is supreme bliss. By
‘laukika nistha’ (Karmayoga and Jnanayoga) the self is realized
and by ‘alaukika nistha’ (Bhaktiyoga) God 1s realized.
“All is God”—Thus the knowledge of God in its entirety a
is God-realization. In Self-realization (salvation) there remains
an iota of subtle ego because of which there is difference of |
opinion among philosophers and in their philosophical thoughts.
If there is no iota of subtle ego, then how can there be difference
in philosophical opinions? But by God-realization even an iota ~
(trace) of subtle ego does not remain and all the philosophical
differences come to an end. It means that as long as there is -
‘atmani’, there are philosophical differences. But when ‘Vasudevah
sarvam’ (all is God) is realized, all differences come to an end,
‘atho mayi’ expresses this God-realization. In such realization .
no existence apart from God is intuited. |

Comment:— |
'Api cedasi papebhyah sarvebhyah papakrttamah'—There
"
603,"562 _ SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4 ~
are, three categories of sinful persons—(1) The sinful. (2) The
more sinful. (3) The most sinful. The Lord uses the superlative ~
degree, to emphasize the fact, that even the most sinful of all
sinners can cross the ocean of sin, by the boat of knowledge,
of the self. | -

The Lord assures strivers that, not only the strivers who are
engaged in spiritual practice, having renounced sins, even those,
who have committed innumerable sins, need not lose heart, as |
far as attainment of salvation (God-realization) is concerned.
Even the most sinful person, can attain salvation in this life, - ~~~
even immediately if he resolves, never to commit sin, but only
to attain salvation or self-realization. The sins, of such a person.
of firm resolve, perish in no time.

As darkness of hundreds of years disappears, as soon as a
lamp is lit, it does not take time, so do sins disappear, as soon
as knowledge of the self is gained.

The Lord uses the term 'Cet' (if) to clarify the point, that -
generally sinners are not engaged in spiritual practice, but it does
not mean that they cannot be engaged in it. If by coming into
contact, with a great soul or by being influenced by an incident
or circumstance or environment etc., they resolve, that they have
to gain knowledge of the self, or God, they cross the ocean of __
sins, by the boat of knowledge, of the self. |

The Lord, in the thirtieth and the thirty-first verses of the

° ninth chapter, declares, ""Even if, a man of most vile conduct
worships Me with exclusive. devotion, he must be regarded as
righteous, for he has rightly resolved and he attains to eternal
peace very quickly.""

‘Sarvam jiianaplavenaiva vrjinam samtarisyasi'—All the sins,
are incurred when a man assumes his affinity for nature and its

~ evolute, the body and the world. When he gains knowledge of
_- all the self, his affinity for them is totally renounced, and he
gets rid of sins.
"
604,"Verse 36] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI _ 563
When he gains knowledge of the self, it means that he
acquired the boat of knowledge. Even the most sinful of all .
sinners crosses the ocean of sins, by the boat of knowledge of
the self. This boat, is such as can neither be broken nor can a
hole be made into it, nor be sunk. Through it, one can cross | -
the ocean of sins. .
This boat of knowledge of the self, can be gained through
knowledge-sacrifice (4/33). Discrimination, occupies an important
place, from the very beginning in the knowledge-sacrifice and
attains perfection in the knowledge of the self. When this CS
perfection is attained, sins perish totally.
Appendix—Here the Lord by the expression ‘papebhyah :
sarvebhyah papakrttamah’ has mentioned the extreme limit of a
sinner. Though the term ‘papebhyah’ being used in plural number
denotes all sinners, yet the Lord has used the term ‘sarvebhyah’ -
with it. The term ‘sarvebhyah’ also stands for ‘all’. Even by using
these two terms the Lord has used the term “papakrttamah’ in the -
superlative degree which stands for the most sinful of all sinners.
The term “papakrt’ is in the positive degree, then ‘papakrttara’ is .
in the comparative degree and ‘papakrttama’ is in the superlative
degree. It means that even the most sinful of all sinners can gain
knowledge (wisdom). The reason is that the number of sins may
be large but they are unreal, while knowledge (wisdom) is real.
How can the unreal face the real? Sin is impure while knowledge
is the purest among the pure (Gita 4/38). How can an impure
thing suppress the pure thing? Therefore sins have no power
to suppress knowledge. The main obstacle to the attainment of
wisdom is attachment to the perishable pleasure (Gita 3/37—41). |
It is because of attachment to pleasure that a man has no relish
for spirituality and without the taste for spirituality, it seems
very difficult to gain knowledge.

As blazing fires burn fuel to ashes, O Arjuna, so, does the fire _

Comment:— |
‘Yathaidhamsi samiddho'gnirbhasmasatkurute'rjuna'— Inthe

preceding verse, the Lord declared, ""You can cross the oceanof —

sins, by the boat of the knowledge of the self."" Now, the question

arises, what will happen to the ocean of sins which still exists. __

The Lord clarifies the point, by giving another illustration. He

declares, that the blazing fire reduces fuel to ashes, so does the

fire of knowledge, reduce all actions (sins) to ashes, ie., all -

sins perish. os
'Jiianagnih sarvakarmani bhasmasatkurute tatha'— As blazing __

fire reduces fuel to ashes, so does the fire of knowledge, reduce

the three kinds of actions (i.e.,)—prarabdha (in the form of fate),

saficita (accumulated actions) and Kriyamana (the present actions), _—

to ashes. It means, that when a man gains knowledge of the self,

his affinity for the actions or the world is totally renounced.

Consequently, the world loses its independent existence and _

there remains, only God.

In fact, all actions are performed by the modes of nature

(Gita 13/29). But a man is bound by these, when he thinks that

he is a doer. An actions, such as circulation of blood, growth

of the body, breathing and digestion etc., are performed by the

modes of nature, so are eating, drinking, walking, sitting, seeing

and speaking etc., undertaken. But when one holds, that he is the
doer of those actions, these bind him. A sense of doership, changes
activities into action, otherwise they are mere activities. —

By knowledge of the self, the stock of accumulated actions,
"
606,"Verse 38] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 565 _
is totally destroyed, because, all accumulated actions depend on ,
ignorance. All present actions are destroyed 1e., change into -
inaction, because one has no sense of doership as they do not
bear any fruit. As far as Prarabdha actions (Fate) are concerned,
these produce favourable and unfavourable circumstances, but -
a man of knowledge, is not in the least affected by them. He |
remains equanimous, without feeling sad or happy. Thus, when
he has no affinity for actions, in the least, all his actions are /
reduced to ashes 1.e., and are changed into inaction. ,
Link:—The Lord, in the first half of the next verse, reveals
the glory of knowledge, while in the second half, He glorifies
Karmayoga (the Discipline of Action).

Comment:—
'Na hi jiianena sadrsam pavitramiha vidyate'— Here the term,
‘Tha’ stands for the human world, because only human beings,
are qualified to gain purity. Such opportunities are not available,
in other species. All nghts, in other species are acquired through
a human body only.
The belief in the independent existence of the world,
and the desire to derive pleasure out of it, give birth to all sins
(Gita 3/37). By the knowledge of the self, when the world ceases
to have its independent existence, all sins are totally destroyed and
a man becomes completely pure. Therefore, in the world, there
"

_ is no other means as capable of sanctifying as knowledge...
| The means, such as performance of sacrifice, charity, penance, —

Yamuna and the Godavari, destroy sins of a man and purify him. |
But none of these is as purifying as is knowledge of the self,
because all of them are means, while knowledge, is the end.

Who is the purest (most sacred), is very pure. TO
""Yogasamsiddhah'—'Yogasarnsiddhah' (perfected in Yoga)
_ stands, for the great soul who has attained perfection, in
.  Karmayoga. Such a great soul, in the fourth verse of the sixth
chapter, has been called 'Yogarudha'’ (one who is enthroned or _
established in Yoga). This state is, the last stage of Karmayoga.
When a striver attains this state, he realizes the self and his
affinity for the world, is totally renounced. -
In Karmayoga (the Discipline of Action), all actions are
performed for the welfare of the world without any selfish motive
and without a sense of doership. By doing so, a striver's affinity
for the body and the world, which are evolutes of nature, is
totally renounced. It means, that in that case, the world has no
independent existence, only actions, are performed. This is known
as perfection in Yoga. |
When a man is attached to action, and its fruit, he does
not realize ""Yoga' 1.e., union with God. In fact, a man has no
affinity for actions and material objects, because he (the self)
is eternal, while these are transitory (perishable). What can the
eternal (Imperishable) self, gain from perishable actions? The
self can gain nothing by actions—this is called 'Karmavijiiana’
(science of action). Having realized this science of action, a
man has no desire to reap the fruit of actions, in the form of
pleasure etc., and then he realizes his natural and eternal, union
"
608,"Verse 38] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI __ 567 -
with God, which is called 'Yogavijfana' (Science of Yoga). This |
is called perfection in Yoga. -
'Tatsvayam kalenatmani vindati'—The knowledge of the self,
which reduces all actions to ashes, and like which, there is no
purifier in this world, is found in the self immediately, when a -
Karmayogi becomes, perfect in Yoga.
In the thirty-fourth verse, the Lord said, that a striver
should go to a wise preceptor, who would instruct him in
(that) knowledge. But by doing so, it is not necessary that
he would gain knowledge, of the self. But here, He declares Tn
that a Karmayogi having become perfected in Yoga, gains
this knowledge, assuredly. :
The term 'Kalena’, used in this verse, needs special attention.
The Lord, has used the third inflexion, which means that through _
the discipline of action, one certainly gains knowledge of the
self or realizes God.*
The term ‘Svayam’, shows that a Karmayogi gains the -
knowledge of the self, while performing his duty, without the
guidance of a preceptor, or the scriptures or any other means. .
The expression 'Atmani vindati' means, that a Karmayogi, in
order to gain knowledge of the self, need not go anywhere else. :
When he becomes perfected in Yoga, he finds this knowledge,
in the self.
As the Lord pervades everywhere, He also pervades the self.
But, a person does not realize this fact, because of his inclination
towards the world and disinclination for God.When he performs
his duty scrupulously, for the welfare of others without any
selfish motive, his affinity for the world is renounced 1.e., his
identity with the body, sense of meum and desire, for the world |
perish, and he finds this knowledge in the self easily. The Lord
* In the term ‘Kalena’ instead of the second inflexion Kalam, third inflexion has
been used which shows that the fruit will be surely reapedi.e., through Karmayoga
the striver will certainly find this knowledge in the self.
"
609,"568 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA  [Chapter4
declares, ""He who is free from dualities (the pairs of opposites),
is released, easily from bondage"" (Gita 5/3). -
_.. This knowledge of the self, cannot be gained by the senses,
mind, intellect and other means (instruments). One will find the -
knowledge of the self, in himself. The reason is, that the sentient
self can't be known by the insentient senses, mind and intellect
~ etc. The means such as, listening to Vedantic texts, cognition and
constant and deep meditations etc., may help, in removing the _
obstacles such as notion of impossibility of gaining knowledge
and contrary sentiments etc., but they cannot induce a man, to ~
- gain the knowledge of self. He can gain that knowledge, by
renouncing his affinity for the insentient. As the world can be
seen with an eye but an eye cannot be seen by itself, but it can
be said, that the organ with which any object is seen, is the eye. _
So it can be said, that He who is the Knower of all persons and
objects etc., and by Whom all objects etc., are known, is the self
or God, Who is not known by any means (Brhadaranyaka. 2/4/4),  -
Having studied, the verses from the thirty-third to the thirty-
seventh, it seems that the Lord has glorified the Discipline of
Knowledge (Jiianayoga). But if we give a serious thought to this,
we come to know, that the Lord says, that knowledge of the |
self, which is so glorious and pure and for gaining which He is
advising to go to preceptors, who are well-versed in the scriptures,
and can be easily and certainly, gained through the Discipline of
Action (Karmayoga). The Lord declares, “He who is perfected in
Yoga, finds this knowledge of the self automatically, in himself""
(Gita 4/38). Thus, He has actually glorified, the Discipline of
Action. He means to say, that the knowledge of the self, which we
_ can gain from wise preceptors through obeisance, questioning and
service and by carrying out their directions, practising cognition,
and constant and deep meditation, can be gained also by performing
one's duty of fighting. It 1s not certain, whether he will gain, the
"
610,"Verse 39] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 569 7
knowledge of the Self from the preceptors, because they may |
themselves not have, realized the Truth. Besides, he may not have
reverence for them. In this process, first he will see all beings in
his self, and then in the Lord (Gita 4/35). Thus, in this process
of gaining knowledge, there is possibility of doubt and delay. -
Therefore, the Lord exhorts Arjuna, to follow the Discipline of :
Action (performance of duty) by which he will gain knowledge
of the Self, certainly and immediately. So, He does not want
to preach him the common method (of eight, inward spiritual a
means), to gain knowledge. | _
Lord Krsna Himself, is the Lord of all the great souls. So,
how can He order Arjuna to go to the wise, who have realized
the Truth and learn knowledge from them? Further, in the forty-
first verse of this chapter, the Lord eulogizes the Discipline of
Action (Karmayoga), and clearly orders Arjuna, in the forty- -
second verse, to fight by being, fixed in equanimity.
Appendix—‘Pavitramiha’—affinity for the world causes -
impurity; on Self-realization, when the universe totally ceases
to be, then there is no question of the persistence of impurity.
Therefore in the knowledge (of the self) there is neither impurity
nor inertness nor modifications.
The term ‘iha’ stands for ‘this world’. It means that Self- |
realization is worldly while God-realization is unworldly.

"
611,"570 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter4 _

knowledge he achieves the Supreme peace in no time. 39 -
Comment:— , :

'Tatparah samyatendriyah'—In this verse, it is mentioned —
that a man who is full of faith, gains knowledge. A man lacking ©
faith, may think that he has faith. So the Lord, has used two
adjectives 'sarnyatendriyah' (who has subdued the senses) and —
‘tatparah’ (devoted), as the criteria of faith. The striver, who |
has subdued his senses, can be called, devoted to knowledge.
If senses have not been subdued, and these hanker after sensual = =
pleasures, it means, that the ‘striver is not, fully devoted, to the

_ knowledge of the Self. |

‘Sraddhavallabhate jiianam'—The esteemed belief in God, .
saints, righteousness and scriptures, is called 'Sraddha' (faith). _

So long as, a striver does not realize God, he should have
as much faith in Him, as he has when he has seen something

| himself. God pervades everywhere, but He is not realized, —
because he believes that He is far away from him. When he
thinks that He is in him, and his only aim is to realize Him, he -
gains knowledge of the Self or God.

The world being ever-changing has no existence of its own,

_ but it seems to exist because of the existence of God. Whena ~—
_ Striver has this faith, he gains knowledge of the self immediately.
It is only because of his lack of faith, that he does not gain this
knowledge immediately.

So long as, senses are not subdued and a striver is not
keen in his efforts, his faith may be regarded, as imperfect. If
the senses are attracted towards their objects, there cannot be
any concentration of effort. That results, in the dominance of

something other than practice. Unless, there is exclusive devotion
to practice, faith cannot mature. Because of immature faith, only
realization of the truth (Self), 1s delayed, otherwise there is not
at all, any cause for delay, in realizing, the Self that 1s ever
"
612,"Verse 39] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 571 -
available and ever present.

A person through obeisance questioning and service, should |
gain knowledge from wise preceptors, as mentioned in the thirty-
fourth verse. But, it is not certain, that he will acquire it because, | _
he can prostrate, question and serve the preceptor, hypocritically, |
not from the heart. But, here in this verse, it is mentioned that
he gains knowledge, certainly because he has faith, which is a /
trait of the heart (Gita 17/3). |

When a striver, has faith that he must gain knowledge of the
self immediately, this is called 'Sraddha’. God is ever-existent and SO
‘I am also existent and I want to realize God.’ Why then delay?

Fully developed faith, immediately leads to God-realization. |

How surprising it is, that the changeful world attracts us,
while the eternal Lord, does not attract us! The reason is, that
we regard the transitory world, as permanent, and want to derive 7
permanent joy out of it, which is impossible.

In fact, all the worldly objects, including the body, senses, ,
mind etc., are perishing (decaying), while the Self is eternal. Had |
the self not been eternal, who might have seen the changes? If a :
man (the self) had identity with the body, he (the self) would have -
also died, with the death of a body. But it is not so. Thus, it is by |
error that he identifies the self with the body otherwise, the self
is eternal, while the world, body, senses, mind etc., are transitory. .

Secondly, in this verse, the term ‘labhate', has been used. It
means, the attainment of something, which is eternal or whichever
exists. A thing, which has no pre-existence or which is created
and compounded, its acquisition cannot be called ‘labhate’. The
reason is, that the thing which did not exist in the past, and
will not exist in future, only appears in the interim, is not but
acquired. To regard acquisition of such a thing appearing in the
interim, is a disrespect to discrimination. The self existed before
"
613,"572 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4
the world was created, and It will exist after the destruction of
the world. Actually, the world does not exist, it seems to exist. —
The unreal has no existence and the real never ceases to be. As
soon as, we realize this fact, it means that we have faith which _
will inspire us, to gain knowledge of the self. |

'Jiianam labdhva param s4antimacirenadhigacchati'—The Lord,
in the third verse of the ninth chapter, declared, in the negative, |
""Those have no faith in this Dharma (knowledge of the Self), .
return to the world of death, without attaining Me."" The same
fact, has been mentioned here, in a positive form, when the
Lord declares, ""He who has faith, attains to the supreme peace""
i.e., is liberated, from the cycle of birth and death. Why does a ~

: man not attain, the supreme peace? The answer is, that a man
seeks the supreme peace in the perishable world—persons and _
objects etc., by having a disinclination, for God. The supreme
peace, abides in all beings naturally, but because a person seeks
it in the perishable world, he cannot attain it. When he gains -
knowledge of the self, his affinity for the world, which is an
abode of sorrow, is totally renounced and he attains the supreme _
peace, which is axiomatic (natural).

Appendix—‘Sraddhavallabhate jiianam’—esteemed belief,
faith and discrimination are necessary for all the strivers. Yes, in _
Karmayoga and Jnanayoga there is predomimance of discrimination
and in Bhaktiyoga there-is predominance of belief-faith. At first
the Self-realization is attainable—this faith a striver must have,
then only he will strive for it.

Link:—In the next verse, the Lord speaks ill of the person,
who lacks discrimination, who has no faith and who is of a
doubtful disposition. :

One who is devoid of discriminative insight, and has no

anywhere. 40

Comment:—

'Ajitascasraddadhanasca samSayatma vinasyati'—The
man, whose discrimination is not aroused, or the man whose
discrimination is aroused but he does not attach importance to TO ee
it, and who lacks faith, such a man of doubting nature, perishes
i.e., is deprived of the spiritual path. Such a person of doubting
nature, uses neither his own discrimination, nor listens to the |
teachings of others. So, how could his doubts be removed and -
how can he progress spiritually?

It is natural, for a striver who follows the spiritual path to be
confronted with doubts, because his knowledge is imperfect, this -
is known as ignorance.* Therefore, the appearance of doubt is
natural, and it is not very harmful. But it proves harmful, when .
a person does not make effort to remove it, and he rather wants,
to maintain it. In such cases, the doubt becomes a principle for
the person, and he holds that spiritual practice, is nothing but .
hypocrisy. So, he ceases to believe in God and the scriptures etc.,
and becomes an atheist. Consequently, it leads to his downfall.
Therefore, a striver should try to remove his doubt. By doing
so, he will gain knowledge. It is characteristic of a striver to
investigate and discover.

*Ajfiana'’ (ignorance) does not mean total absence of knowledge but it
means imperfect knowledge. A man (the self) being a fragment of God can't lack |
knowledge (discrimination) totally. But he attaches importance to the unreal by
regarding as real. Moreover he has no disinclination for the unreal, even when he
regards it as unreal. This is ignorance. If he makes the right use of his knowledge
(discrimination), his ignorance will perish and discrimination will be revealed
because ignorance has no independent existence.
"
615,"574 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4
A striver, should go on proceeding further to attain his
aim.. He should not be satisfied with, what he has known. He -
should have a burning desire to remove his doubts, and acquire
knowledge. By adopting such an attitude, his doubts are removed .
by saints or scriptures or by other means. If there is, no one to |
remove his doubts, it is removed by God's grace.
| _ The soul, is a fragment of God (Gita 15/7). Therefore, when
It has a desire to attain God, and feels sad and uneasy without BO
attaining Him, He cannot tolerate his sadness, and He satisfies
his desire. Similarly, when a striver, gets uneasy or sad, in order :
to remove his doubts, the Lord Himself, removes his doubts
and frees him from sadness, he has not to pray to Him even. _
An intense feeling of a person to have his doubt removed does
reach God automatically. :
The Lord, is a disinterested friend of all beings (Gita 5/29). -
So, He ever remains prepared to do away with restlessness, sadness
and doubts of a man, somehow or the other. One commits an .
error, that having known a little he feels that, he has attained
perfect knowledge. This pride leads to his downfall.

-""Nayam loko'sti na paro na sukharh samSayatmanah'—lIn this
verse, there is description of such a man of suspicious nature, |
who is ignorant i.e., who lacks discrimination and who is faithless
i.e., does not follow the preaching of others. Such a man, of
sceptical nature, perishes. For him, there is neither this world,
nor the world beyond, nor any happiness.

In practical life, a man of doubting nature, behaves badly
towards others, because he suspects their integrity and actions etc.
He also cannot attain salvation, because it requires a determinate
intellect, or firm resolve and a man of doubting nature, cannot
resolve, whether he should chant the Lord's name, study the
scriptures, perform mundane actions or attain God-realization .
"
616,"Verse 41] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 575
and so on. Because of his doubting nature, he cannot attain ;
happiness or peace. Therefore, a striver through discrimination
and faith, must get rid of a doubt.

When a striver, comes across two contradictory statements, _
it leads to scepticism. Such scepticism can be removed, either
by discrimination or through a reverential study of scriptures,
or by following the advice of saints and holy men. Thus, if a
sceptic is lacking in knowledge, he should acquire knowledge
and wisdom. If he is wanting in faith, he should endeavour to
gain faith. It is, because without especially enhancing either of en
these two, his scepticism cannot be removed.

Appendix—If a man has knowledge, his doubt is destroyed—
‘Jnanasanchinnasamsayam’ (Gita 4/41) or if he has faith, then
also his doubt can be wiped out—‘éraddhavallabhate jfianam’
(Gita 4/40). If there is lack of both knowledge and faith, then -
doubt cannot be slashed. Therefore the sceptic who is devoid
of knowledge (discrimination) and has no faith (belief) viz., he ;
who neither knows himself nor follows the instructions of others
(the wise), has a downfall or is ruined.

DOL SEES AS OD

Link:— The Lord, having started the topic of the Discipline
of Knowledge in the thirty-third verse, discussed the method of |
attaining knowledge and revealed its glory. Then, He declared,
‘Knowledge which can be gained through prostration and service
etc., from the teacher, can be automatically gained by a man, who
has attained perfection in Karmayoga.’’ After that He described
the person who is eligible to attain this knowledge as also the
person, who is ineligible for it. Thus, he concluded the topic. ,

Now the question arises, what should a Karmayogi do,
in order to attain perfection in Yoga. The Lord, answers the
question, in the next verse.

| He, who has renounced all actions by Yoga, whose doubts have
been destroyed by knowledge and who takes shelter in 'yoga', him, ~
actions do not bind, O winner of wealth (Arjuna). 41
Comment:— |
'Yogasannyastakarmanam'—A\ll objects, such as body,senses, “
mind and the intellect etc., which seem ours, have been bestowed
upon us, so that we may render service to others, with them, Mo cee
rather, than to lay a claim on these. Therefore, if these are
utilized, in rendering service to others, by considering them as |
theirs, the flow of actions and objects is towards the world, and
we realize equanimity, which is axiomatic. Thus, such a Karmayogi, |
who through equanimity has renounced his affinity for actions,
is called 'Yogasannyastakarma’, (one who has renounced actions
by Yoga). | : | -
When a Karmayogi sees, inaction in action, and action in
inaction 1.e., ever remains detached, during performance or non-
performance of actions, he is really ""Yogasannyastakarma’.
' Jiidnasaiichinnasamsayam'—Generally, a man has doubts
how he will be able to renounce his affinity for actions, while ;
performing them, how he will attain salvation, if he does not
work for himself, and so on. But when he knows the reality
about actions, all his doubts are dispelled.* He comes to know
very well, that actions and their fruits are transitory, while the
self, ever remains uniform. Therefore, actions have their affinity
for the world, rather than for the self. In this way when actions
are performed with a selfish motive, a man is attached to these
_  L.e., develops affinity for them. But, when they are performed for
others, without any selfish motive, affinity for them is renounced.
_ *The reality about actions has been described from the sixteenth to the
thirty-second verses of this chapter. Out of them the eighteenth verse is an
important one. :
"
618,"Verse 42] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 577
It proves, that performance of action for. others, not for one's .
own self, leads to salvation. | |
'‘Atmavantam’'—A Karmayogi, aims at Self-realization. So,
he ever remains self-possessed. All his actions, including eating,
drinking, sleeping and sitting etc., are performed for others (the :
world), because actions have an affinity for the world, not for the self.
- ‘Na karmani nibadhnanti'—When, a Karmayogi does not ~
- perform any action for himself, his affinity for actions is |
renounced and he gets liberated, from the worldly bondage ee
forever (Gita 4/23). )
In fact, it is not actions which lead to bondage, but it is desire
for fruit, sense of mine, attachment and the sense of doership
for actions, which lead one to bondage.
Oo | CIOL DD -
Link:—In the preceding verse, the Lord declared, ""Doubts are
destroyed by knowledge, and affinity for actions, is renounced by -
equanimity."" Now in the next verse, He orders Arjuna to resort

O Bharata (Arjuna). 42 |
Comment:— |
'Tasmadajiianasambhitam hrtstham  $jnanasinatmanah
chittvainarh samsayam'—In the preceding verse, the Lord
declared, ""He who has renounced affinity for all actions by Yoga
(equanimity), whose doubts have been dispelled by knowledge, -
"
619,"578 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 4 |
and who is self-possessed— actions do not bind him 1.e., he is -
liberated from the bondage of birth and death. Therefore, He by
using the term 'Tasmat' (therefore), inspires Arjuna to perform |
his duty. Arjuna had a doubt how the cruel deed of fighting, :
would lead him to salvation. Moreover, he was in a dilemma,
whether he should follow the Discipline of Action or that of
Knowledge. So the Lord advises him, to remove his doubt, so :
that he may perform his duty scrupulously. A doubting soul,
can, never perform his duty efficiently. oo nnn enn
The expression ‘ajnanasambhutam’' (born of ignorance), means
that all doubts are born out of ignorance i.e., when a man does :
not understand the true nature of actions and Yoga. Ignorance,
consists in regarding actions and objects, as one's own and for -
one's own self. So long as, there is ignorance, doubt resides in
the heart, because actions and objects are perishable, while the
self 1s imperishable. -
In the third chapter, emphasis has been laid on the performance
(discharge) of duty, while in the fourth chapter, there is an
emphasis on knowing the truth, about Karmayoga. The reason
is, that action can be performed scrupulously, only when reality
is known about it. Moreover, if the truth about actions is known, |
such actions, which bind a man, can liberate him from bondage
(Gita 4/16,32). Therefore, in this chapter, the Lord has laid special
emphasis on, knowing the truth about actions.
In the preceding verse, also the Lord pointed out this fact,
by the expression ‘JnanasanchinnasamSsayam' (whose doubts have
been destroyed by knowledge). All the doubts of a man, who
comes to know the skill of performance of actions, (duties) are
destroyed. This art of action, consists in doing nothing, for one's
own self. 7
""Yogamatisthottistha bharata'—Arjuna had sunk into the seat
of his chariot, casting away his bow and arrow (Gita 1/47).
He gave the Lord, .a flat denial by declaring that he would not
"
620,"Verse 42] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 579 :
fight (Gita 2/9). Here, the Lord directs Arjuna to stand up, for
a fight having resorted to Yoga. The same order was given to -
Arjuna, in the forty-eighth verse of the second chapter, when He
said, ""Perform action, being steadfast in Yoga."" The term 'Yoga’,
stands for equanimity (evenness of mind). The Lord declares, -
""Evenness of mind is called, Yoga"" (Gita 2/48).

Arjuna thought, that sin would accrue to him by fighting
(Gita 1/36, 45). Therefore, Lord Krsna orders him to fight by -
having evenness of mind; thus he would not incur sin (Gita
2/38). In this way, we see that performance of duty by being See ene
equanimous, is a means to be liberated from, the bondage of actions.

In the world, innumerable actions are performed, but we remain :
free from their bondage, because we have neither attachment
nor aversion for them. It is because of attachment or aversion,
that we are linked with actions. When we become free, from -
attachment and aversion i.e., get established in equanimity, we
are not connected with actions and thus become free, from the _
bondage of actions. |

The self, ever remains equanimous and uniform, while
actions and their fruits, always undergo changes. When actions
are performed for others and objects are regarded as others’ and
for them, affinity for actions and objects, is totally renounced |
and equanimity, which is axiomatic, is automatically realized.

Fifth Chapter
INTRODUCTION |

Lord Krsna, in the fourth chapter, from the thirty-third to ,
the thirty-seventh verse, praised the tradition of going to teachers,
who have realized the Truth, having renounced actions and
sense-objects and directed Arjuna to gain knowledge from them -
(Gita 4/34). In this process of Self-realization, it is indispensable
to meditate upon God in solitude by renouncing action. Arjuna -
did not want to fight, because he thought that he would incur OS
sin, by fighting. He wanted to attain salvation. So Arjuna
thought, that the Lord was asking him to gain knowledge, by
renouncing actions.

Then the Lord, in the thirty-eighth verse of the fourth chapter, -
declared, ""He who is perfect in Yoga, gains it (knowledge) in
the Self."" It means that a striver following the Discipline of a
action, need not go to the great persons, who have realized truth -
nor has he to practise any other spiritual discipline, in order to
gain knowledge. Thus Karmayoga (the Discipline of Action) as -
the means of Self-realization has been commended here.

Arjuna, in the thirty-third verse of the fourth chapter, heard
the glory of the customary method of gaining knowledge and |
in the thirty-fourth verse by the term 'viddhi', he held it as the
Lord's order for him to gain knowledge by that method. He heard
the praise of Karmayoga (the discipline of action), in the thirty-
eighth verse and the forty-first verse. In the forty-second verse,
He ordered him to perform his duty of fighting. Thus, having
heard the glory of Jianayoga' and 'Karmayoga’' both, and also
His order to gain knowledge and to perform one's duty, Aruna,
could not decide which one of the two disciplines, was better.
Therefore, in order to get his doubt cleared by Lord Krsna,
Arjuna puts a question.

Arjuna said: | 7

O Krsna thou praisest, the renunciation of actions externally Co ee
(Sankhyayoga) as well as their unselfish performance (Karmayoga),
tell me, for certain, which one of the two is decidedly conducive
to my good. 1
Comment:—

'Sannyasam karmanam krsna'—Arjuna, did not want to ~
fight, because he did not want to kill his kinsmen.. In order to
support his ‘stand, Arjuna put forward several arguments, as in -
the first chapter. He said, that fighting would incur sin (Gita |
1/45). According to him, it was better to live in the world even
by begging than to fight (2/5) and he bluntly said to Krsna, that :
he would not fight (2/9).

Generally, a listener interprets a preacher's word, according
to his own views. Having seen his kith and kin, Arjuna, out of |
delusion, thought it proper, to abandon his duty of fighting. So,
he interpreted the Lord's word, according to his view, that He was
praising the attainment of Self-realization, by renouncing actions.

""Punaryogam ca Samsasi'—The Lord, in the thirty-eighth verse
of the fourth chapter, declared, ""He who is perfected in Yoga,
finds this knowledge (wisdom) of the Self, certainly without the
aid of any other spiritual discipline.” Keeping this fact in mind,
Arjuna says to the Lord, that sometimes He praises the Discipline
of Knowledge (4/33), while at other time He commands the
Discipline of Action (4/41).
"
624,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 583 _

""Yacchreya etayorekari tanme brihi suniscitam'—This question,
was put by Arjuna, in the seventh verse of the second chapter -
also. In response, the Lord, having explained Karmayoga, ordered
Arjuna to perform action, being established in Yoga, (even- |
mindedness), in the forty-seventh and forty-eighth verses of the :
second chapter. Again, in the second verse of the third chapter,

Arjuna asked the Lord, ""Tell me decisively, the one way by.
which I may attain to the highest good, (bliss or salvation)."" In 7
response, the Lord, in the thirtieth verse of the third chapter,
ordered him to fight, being free from desire, feeling of mineness
and mental woe (grief) while, in the thirty-fifth verse He declared, OO
""Better is one's own duty, though devoid of merit than the duty
of another well discharged.""

In this chapter also, the Lord clearly declares, ""The unselfish
performance of action, is better than the renunciation of action"" ~
(5/2); ""a Karmayogi is easily set free, from bondage” (5/3);
“renunciation is difficult to attain, without Yoga (Karmayoga) but
a Karmayogi attains, quickly, the Absolute"" (5/6). Thus, the Lord 7
explains to Anjuna, that he should follow the Discipline of Action,
by which he can attain to the Absolute, very quickly and easily. ”

Arjuna was, especially interested in attaining salvation. So,
time and again, he asked Lord Krsna, the way to attain salvation
(2/7; 3/2; 5/1). A keen desire, plays an important role, in attaining
salvation. Even without dispassion, a striver having a keen desire
for salvation, can follow the Discipline of Action, in order to
attain his aim of salvation. Arjuna was not totally dispassionate,
but he had a keen desire to attain salvation, and so he was a
deserving candidate.

The thirty-second verse of the first chapter and the eighth verse
of the second chapter, reveal that, not to speak of the kingdom
on earth, Arjuna does not even desire to attain, an unrivaHed
sovereignty, over the gods. But it does not mean that Arjuna
had no desire to gain a kingdom and pleasures, because he said
"
625,"584 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [ChapterS
that he longed neither for victory nor kingdom nor pleasures,
by slaying his kinsmen. It means, that he was prepared to gain -
victory or kingdom, without slaying his kinsmen. Again, in the
sixth verse of the second chapter, he said, ""We don't know
whether we shall conquer them, or they will conquer us, and
we do not want to live by slaying them.” It means, that if it was
certain, that they would conquer the enemy and if they could |
get the kingdom without slaying them, they were prepared to -
gain it. Further, in the thirty-seventh verse of the second chapter,
the Lord said to Arjuna, that he would be benefited in either ee
case. If he was killed, he would go to heaven, and if he became
victorious, he would enjoy the earth. Had Arjuna, no desire, in
the least, to go to heaven and to enjoy the worldly pleasures,
the Lord, perhaps, would not utter such words. It means, that
Arjuna could not cultivate real dispassion, but he had a desire -
to attain salvation, which is also clear in this verse. .

| The Blessed Lord said: |

""Sannyasa' (discipline of knowledge) and 'Karmayoga' (discipline
of action) both lead to salvation. But of the two 'Karmayoga’ Is
superior to 'Sankhyayoga’'. 2 a
Comment:—

[According to the principle of the Lord every person can
"
626,"Verse 2] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 585
follow the Disciplines of Action and Knowledge, (Renunciation _.
of Actions) of whatever caste, order of life and sect etc., he may -
be because His precept is. not for the people of any particular
- caste, order of life or sect etc. In the first verse of this chapter |
.Arjyuna called the customary method of gaining knowledge
by approaching enlightened soul having renounced actions as
‘Karmasannyasa’ (Renunciation of Actions). But according to
the Lord's precept a person can gain knowledge by following 7
the Discipline of knowledge even without renouncing actions.
Therefore, the Lord, supporting the customary principle of Arjuna, oo
answers the question according to His own tenet.] |

'‘Sanny4sah'—Here, this term, ‘Sannyasah’ stands for 'Sankhyayoga’
(Discipline of Knowledge), rather than renunciation of actions.

While answering Arjuna’s question, the Lord discusses the path |
of ‘Sankhyayoga’, in order to gain knowledge. Through that 7
Sankhyayoga, every man, while performing his duty, according

to his caste, order of life and sect etc., in every circumstance, -
can gain knowledge, of the self 1.e., attain salvation.

In the 'Sankhya’ discipline, there is prominence given to
discrimination. This discipline cannot be successful, without keen a
dispassion and discrimination. While following this discipline,

a striver keeps his eye only on God, without accepting the
independent existence of the world. So, the Lord declares, ""The |
goal of the Unmanifested, is hard to reach by the embodied being""
(Gita 12/5). In the sixth verse of this chapter, also the Lord
declares, that Sannyasa is difficult to attain without Karmayoga,
and Karmayoga is an easy means, to get detached from the world.

""Karmayogasca'—Every human being, has been attached to |
the performance of actions, from time immemorial. In order
to, do away with this attachment, performance of action, is
indispensable (Gita 6/3). Karmayoga, is the art of performing
actions, in order to, get rid of this attachment. In Karmayoga,
(Discipline of Action), every action, whether trivial or otherwise,
"
627,"586 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5 -
is not to be taken note of; but it has to be performed, for the
welfare of others without any selfish motive, in order to get -
detached from it. So long as, actions are performed with a desire
for their reward, one remains attached to these. |
""NihSreyasakaravubhau'—In response to Arjuna's question, |
which he put in the first verse, the Lord says, that both Sankhyayoga
and Karmayoga, lead to salvation, because the same equanimity is
attained, through both of these. The same fact, has been clarified, -
in the fourth and the fifth verses of this chapter. It has also |
been pointed out by the Lord, in the twenty-fourth verse of the a
thirteenth chapier, when He declares, ""Some attain knowledge, of
the self by the path of knowledge, while others attain it by the
path of action."" Thus, both the paths of knowledge and action,
are independent paths, to attain God (Gita 3/3). .
'Tayostu karmasannyasat'—Sankhyayoga, is of two kinds—one -
has been described, in the thirty-fourth verse of the fourth chapter,
in which there is physical renunciation of actions, while the other 7
has been described, from the eleventh to the thirtieth verses of
the second chapter, in which there is no renunciation of actions.
Here the expression 'Karmasannyasat’ stands, for the two kinds ;
of Sankhyayoga. : :
'Karmayogo visisyate'—The Lord, in the third verse, explains |
that a Karmayogi should be regarded as a perpetual Sannyasi,
(with the spirit of renunciation), because he is easily released
from worldly bondage. Again, in the sixth verse, He declares
that renunciation is difficult to attain, without Karmayoga and
a Karmayogi quickly attains to the Absolute. It means, that
in Sankhyayoga (Discipline of Knowledge), there is need of
Karmayoga, while in Karmayoga, there is none for Sankhyayoga.
Thus, out of the two, which lead to salvation, the path of action,
has been declared to be superior, by the Lord.
A Karmayogi, performs actions for the welfare of the world
and also to set an example to the masses (Gita 3/20), without any
"
628,"Verse 2] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 587 -
selfish motive. This sort of action is called a sacrifice in Gita. :
He, who performs actions for himself is bound (Gita 3/9, 13). _
But a Karmayogi, who works only for the welfare of the world
without any selfish motive, is liberated from the bondage of all
actions (Gita 4/23). Therefore, Karmayoga is better of the two. -

The path of action, can be followed by all the people, of all
castes, creeds and order of life etc., under all circumstances. But
the Karmasannyasa (renunciation), Arjuna talks about, can be -
followed, only under special circumstances (Gita 4/34), because |
all the people cannot come across such great men, who have oo
realized the truth. Moreover, they cannot have full faith, in those
great souls and have an opportunity to live, in their company.

Thus Karmayoga, is better of the two.

Karmayoga, consists in making proper use of available
circumstances, even savage deeds of fighting. No one is incapable, -
and dependent on following this path of action, because in it,

there is no desire to acquire anything. It is the desire, which -
makes a man incapable and dependent.

A sense of doership, and the desire to reap the fruit of actions, :
lead to bondage. A Sankhyayogi and a Karmayogi both, have to
renounce their affinity, for the world. A Sankhyayog!, roots out
a sense of doership through dispassion and discrimination, while |
a Karmayogi, discards it by performing actions, for the welfare
of others, without any desire for the fruit of actions. Thus, the
former is liberated by renouncing a sense of doership, while the
latter is liberated, by renouncing desire to reap the fruit of action. |
If a striver, renounces the sense of doership, his desire for the
fruit of action, is also renounced; and if he renounces the desire
for the fruit of action, his sense of doership is renounced. A man,
has a sense of doership, only when he has a desire, to acquire
something or the other. When actions are performed without
desire for fruit, these change, into inaction. Thus a Karmayogi
is like as instrument, has no sense of doership. |

629,"«588 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
A striver, tries to renounce his attachment to the worldly
beings, objects and circumstances etc., because it leads him to -
bondage. In order to renounce it, he does not consider any being
or object etc., as his own nor does he do and desire anything,
for himself. All his actions are performed for the welfare of 7
others, without any selfish motive. The desire for fruit of action
| causes a sense of doership and a sense of 'mine’. If he has no
desire for the fruit of action, his sense of doership, comes to an _
end. It is not actions, but attachment to them and the desire for :
fruit, which lead to bondage. When one does not derive pleasure Se
out of actions, nor does he desire fruit, how can a sense of
doership remain? When he has no desire for the fruit of action,
his sense of doership merges, in the aim (God) for which action
is performed and then only God remains.
The 'egoism' of a Karmayogi, perishes quickly and easily, -
because he works for others. So his egoism is, also absorbed
in rendering service to others. But the egoism of a Jnanayogl, -
(he who follows the path of knowledge) continues to exist, as
he holds that he is a 'Mumuksu' (seeker; of salvation). and he
works for his salvation. A Karmayogi, performs all activities -
for the good of others. Thus his ego subsides. On the other
hand, a Jnanayogi practises discipline, for his well-being. His
ego subsists, as he practises discipline, for himself. | |
A prominent feature of 'the Discipline of Knowledge’, is the
lack of independent existence of the world; while an important
feature of 'the Discipline of Action’, is lack of attachment. A striver,
following the Discipline of Knowledge, through discrimination,
wants to hold that there is no independent existence of the world
but due to his attachment to the worldly objects, it is very difficult
for him to hold this opinion, in his practical life. But a striver,
following the Discipline of Action, gets rid of his attachment
automatically, as his aim, is to render service to others, without
any selfish motive. Moreover, it is easy for a Karmayogi, to
"
630,"Verse 2] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 589 -
renounce objects, as these will be utilized by others; while it is |
difficult for a Jianayogi to renounce them, by regarding these, -
as transitory and illusive, unless his dispassion, is very keen.
Secondly, a Jiianayogi easily abandons objects of inferior quality,
but these of superior quality which he considers useful for him, -
cannot be easily, abandoned. But a Karmayogi, may offer objects
which are useful for him to others, easily, because he believes that
these will be used by others. If there is, an extra slice of bread -
in a plate, we try to put away the one which is stale, spoiled |
and dry; but if we want to give a slice to anyone, we will give ee
a good one, so that it may be used by him. So, the Discipline
of Knowledge, is very difficult to practise, without renouncing .
attachment. It 1s because of attachment that a Jnanayogi, being
entangled in worldly pleasures, may have a fall.

A man, cannot renounce attachment, merely by knowing the -
unreal, as unreal.* Though objects seen on a screen, in the cinema
are unreal, yet a cinema-goer gets attached to the cinema and -
wastes his time, money, eyesight and character. It is attachment,
rather than the object which bind a man. Thus, an object which
may be either real or unreal, or it may transcend the two, but -
it binds a man if he is attached to it. So a striver, should try to
root out this attachment.

Appendix—Though without ‘Yoga’ both ‘Karma’ and ‘Jnana’
lead to bondage yet performance of actions does not lead to
as much ruin as the bookish knowledge does. Mere bookish
knowledge can lead to hells— |

‘ajnasyardhaprabuddhasya sarvam brahmeti yo _ vadet
mahanirayajalesu sa tena viniyojitah
(Yogavasistha sthiti 39).

| * A man can renounce the unreal by regarding it as unreal by being established
in the self. This establishment in the self does not depend on instruments such as
the mind and intellect etc., because they themselves are unreal. How can we get
rid of the unreal while our affinity of the unreal subsists and we depend upon it
for realising the Real?
"
631,"590 §RIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapters -
“He, who preaches the gospel ‘all is Brahma’ to an ignorant |
man, condemns that man to the snare of fightful hells.” -
Therefore the man ‘who perform actions 1s superior to the man
- . possessing bookish knowledge. Then what can be said about the
- superiority of the person who follows the Discipline of Action! :
A Jnanayog! is useful only for himself but a Karmayogi is useful
for the entire universe. He, who 1s useful for the universe, is
also useful for himself—this is the rule. Therefore a Karmayogi ~~
is superior to a Jnanayog!. 7 |
The Discipline of Action can be practised without the - - ~~ |
Discipline of Knowledge but the Discipline of Knowledge is
_ difficult to attain without the Discipline of Action (Gita 5/6). ,
Therefore Karmayoga is superior to Sankhyayoga, Discipline of
Devotion is superior to Discipline of Action. Therefore in the |
Gita there is description first of Sankhyayoga, then of Karmayoga
and afterwards of Bhaktiyoga.* In this order the Yogas have
been discussed. ,
_ Karmayoga and Jnanayoga—both bear the same fruit (Gita
5/4-5). In their practices ‘Karmayoga’ and ‘Bhaktiyoga’ are ;
one—‘maitrah karuna eva ca’ (Gita 12/13); because Karmayoga
and Bhaktiyoga—in both, feeling of providing happiness to others
reigns. In the performance of actions ‘Karm1’ (One who perform |
actions) and ‘Karmayog?’ (who without attachment acts for the 7
welfare of others) are one (Gita 3/25) and in the performance
of actions, an enlightened soul and God are similar (one) (Gita
3/22—26). In this way a Karmayogi becomes one with a Karmt,
* The same order has been followed in the Bhagavata—

‘I have mentioned three yogas for the men who want to attain
salvation—Jianayoga, Karmayoga and Bhaktiyoga. Besides these three there
is no-other way for salvation.”’

a Jiianayogi, a Bhaktiyogi and God, all the four—this is the :
special characteristic of Karmayoga. ~

In ‘Sankhyayoga’ a subtle trace of ego may persist but in
‘Karmayoga’ because of the total detachment from actions and -
objects, no subtle trace of ego subsists. In Karmayoga, ‘Akarma’ 7
remains (Gita 4/18) while m Sankhyayoga the soul (self) remains
(Gita 6/29). |

Link:—Now, the Lord in the next verse, explains why Bo
Karmayoga is better of the two.

Wa: G Preaaearat at a Shy A areata |

Fidel fe veraret weet aerarpers 3

jneyah sa nityasannyasi yo na dvesti na kanksati
_ nirdvandvo hi mahabaho sukharh bandhatpramucyate

He who neither hates nor desires anything should be known -
as a Nitya Sannyasi (ever a renouncer); for, free from dualities
(pairs of opposites) he is liberated easily from bondage, O mighty- |
armed (Arjuna). 3
Comment:— 7

_ ‘Mahabaho'—The term 'Mahabaho', stands for one who is ,
mighty-armed i.e., brave, and also for one, whose brothers and
friends, are great men. Arjuna’s friend, was Lord Krsna, the
disinterested friend of all beings, and his brother was Yudhisthira,

the most righteous person, who had no enemy. By addressing
Arjuna as 'Mahabaho’, the Lord means to say, that he possesses
the might to follow the path of action easily.

'Yo na dvesti'—A Karmayogi, does not hate any being, object, |
circumstance or principle etc., but he renders selfless service to

everyone. If he has the least, hatred for anyone, he cannot follow,
the Discipline of Action, scrupulously. He should give priority,
in rendering service, to a person for whom he bears, even a little ;
"
633,"592 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [ChapterS  ~
malice. The Lord, by using the expression 'Na dvesti’, first of
all, wants to impress, that he who deems someone, as bad and -
wants to harm him, cannot grasp the secret of 'Karmayoga’. ~
For a Karmayogi, it is more significant to renounce evil,
rather than to do good, for the welfare of others. Actions and
objects are limited and, therefore, only limited service, can be .
rendered with such resources. But, when a man renounces evil,
his unlimited inward feeling, is prominent. Secondly, by doing ~- == ~~
good to others, a person cultivates notion of pride, which is the
root of all demoniac traits. Where there is imperfection, there
is pride. On the contrary, where there is perfection, pride is out
of the question. -
If a serious thought is given, it becomes clear that no good
can be done, without the help of perishable objects. In fact, those
perishable objects are not ours, but they are of those, whose -
service is rendered with them. Then, if a man is proud of doing
good, it is attachment to the perishable. So long as, a man is |
. attached to the perishable, he cannot attain Yoga. The pride of
doing good, is more disastrous, than other evils, because it settles,
in the sense of T'ness. Actions and their fruits disappear, but
pride settled in the sense of 'T'ness, never disappears. Secondly,
an evil as an evil, can be easily renounced. But when an evil
disguises itself as a virtue, it is difficult to renounce it. In the
same way, we can easily discard iron hand cuffs, but we find it
difficult to discard gold ones, because they look like ornaments.
When evil is renounced, by a man, good to the entire world, is
automatically done by him. A person, free from evil, does good
to the entire universe, even while, leading a secluded life, in a
Himalayan cave.
| 'Na kanksati'—Renunciation of desire, is very important, in
Karmayoga. A Karmayogi does not desire, any being or object
"
634,"Verse 3] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 593 -
or circumstance. Renunciation of desire, is very much connected )
with the welfare of others. By rendering service to others, we -
get the required strength to give up desire. |
In Karmayoga, it is a doer who is desireless, not action. -
Being inert, actions are not desireless or otherwise. All actions,
are dependent on the doer. A doer being desireless, his actions
are called desireless. Those actions, without expectation of fruit,
are called 'Karmayoga’. 'Karmayoga’ and 'Niskama-karma’—both .
are synonyms. ‘Karmayoga'’ is never 'Sakama’ (with a selfish
motive). The desireless doer, remains detached from the fruit Terns
of action. :
When actions are performed without any selfish motive, it |
is called Karmayoga. When actions are performed in this way,
the doer becomes detached, from the fruit of actions. But, when _
he performs actions by being attached to- fruit of actions, he
is bound (Gita 5/12). When all actions are performed for the
welfare of others, without any selfish motive, a striver is easily -
set free, from bondage. Therefore a doer should ever remain
desireless. The more, selfless he is, the more efficient, the practice .
of the discipline. On being totally desireless, the Karmayogi
reaches, consummation. :
'‘Jieyah sa nityasannydsi'—Arjuna thought it better to live
in the world even by begging, than to fight (Gita 2/5). So in
response to his statement, the Lord seems to clarify, that such
renunciation apprehending the death of teachers is external
(outwardly); but real renunciation consists, in being free from
attachment and aversion, while performing action.
Further, in the first verse of the sixth chapter also, the Lord
declares, ""He who does not light the sacred fire, is not a Sannyasi.""
It means, that a person who renounces all actions, such as sacrificial
fire etc., is not a Sannyasi. Sannyasa (renunciation), is an inward
attitude, by which a Karmayogi renounces his dependence, on
the world. Such a Karmayog! is a real Sannyasi (renouncer). 7
"
635,"594 | SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [ChapterS ~
_ Sannyasa (renunciation), consists in the performance of actions
without being attached to them, in anyway. A striver, who has ~
no affinity for actions, has never to reap its fruit (Gita 18/12).
Therefore, a Karmayogi, while performing actions sanctioned by
the scriptures, is ever a Sannyasi (renouncer). -

It is difficult to follow, the Discipline of Knowledge, without
following the Discipline of Action. Therefore, a striver who follows
the Discipline of Knowledge, is first a Karmayogi and then a —
Sannyasi (Sankhyayog1). But, for a Karmayog! it is not necessary
to follow the Discipline of Knowledge. So, a Karmayogi isa = ~~-—--—----
Sannyasi (renouncer), from the very beginning.

He, who has renounced attachment and aversion, need not go :
to the renounced order. When a striver resolves, that any person,
object, senses, mind and intellect, are neither his nor for him; |
and he has neither attachment nor aversion for them, he is, ever
a renouncer. A Karmayogi, while performing either mundane or
spiritual actions, ever remains detached. This detachment is real  -
renunciation. Therefore, he should be known, as one who has
ever the spirit of renunciation. 3 -

""Nirdvandvo_ hi.....sukham bandhatpramucyate’*—At the
beginning of the spiritual discipline, a striver has opposite
experiences in the form of attachment and aversion. He, through |
good company, study of scriptures and discrimination, decides
on God-realization as his aim, but his so-called mind and senses,
etc., are naturally, inclined towards pleasure and prosperity. Thus,
sometimes he wants to attain God, while at other times, he hankers
after worldly pleasures and prosperity. His inclination changes

* There is description of this sort of release from bondage in the Gita in the
following expressions:—'Shall cast off bondage of action’ (2/39); ‘protects one
from great fear’ (2/40); ‘one casts off in this life both good and evil deeds’ (2/50);

‘shall be liberated from the evil’ (4/16, 9/1); ‘shall cross all sins (4/36); ""having
attained Me these great souls don't take birth here which ts the place of pain and
which is non-eternal’ (9/28); and T straightway deliver from the ocean of death-
bound existence’ (12/7) and so on. ;
"
636,"Verse 3] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 595 -
according to the company he keeps. But he cannot enjoy, the
worldly pleasures undisturbed, because the latent impressions of -
good company etc., cause dispassion (disinclination for pleasures)
in his mind. Thus, there is a duel between pleasure and spiritual
practice. Egoism, hinges on this duel. When a striver, has a -
determinate intellect, only to realize God, rather than to hanker
after worldly pleasures and prosperity, this duel comes to an end
and his egoism, merges in God. | -
There is a struggle between, the pairs of opposites, so long
as a man, derives pleasures out of the persons and objects etc. oe
This inclination for pleasure does not let the determination for
God-realization, become firm. So there is a struggle. When a
striver has a determinate intellect, that he has to work for the
welfare of others without hankering after worldly pleasures, he
becomes free from the pairs of opposites. -
By the expression 'Na dvesti na kanksati’, the Lord, advises
strivers, that they should be free from antithetical feelings. Hate 7
(aversion) and desire (attachment), are stumbling blocks to God-
realization. A man, has to reap the fruit of his past actions, in
the form of desirable and undesirable circumstances, whether -
he desires them or not. But, it is an error, that he is attached
to desirable circumstances and has aversion for the undesirable
ones. As soon as, this error is rectified through discrimination,
he becomes free, from attachment and aversion.
Secondly, the self always exists independently, without
the help of objects, persons and actions etc. A man, (the self)
(the soul), has its existence, during sound sleep, also when he
is oblivious of the entire world. In the wakeful and dreamy
states, he can exist, even without any being and object. So, why
should he have attachment or aversion for them? By thinking
so, attachment and aversion, come to an end.
Attachment and aversion, are perishable, but a person being
attached to persons and objects etc., wants to maintain these. As |
"
637,"596 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter5S.  -
far as desire for God-realization is concerned, it ever remains .
uniform, because the self is a fragment of God. But the desire ~
seems to increase and decrease, because of his less and more
attachment for the world, respectively. His desire to live, to
know and to be happy, is in fact, the desire to attain the Truth, = -
Knowledge and Bliss 1.e., God. This desire, constantly prevails
in a human being. When attachment to the world, is renounced
_and there is only one desire for God-realization, he becomes =__
free, from the pair of opposites.

A striver, following anyone of the three paths—of action, = ss.
of knowledge or of devotion, must be free from the pairs of
opposites. So long as, there is delusion of the pairs of opposites,

a man is not liberated from bondage (Gita 7/27). Attachment

and aversion, are enemies which are the stumbling blocks to
God-realization (Gita 3/34). When a striver, becomes free from -
dualities, (pairs of opposites), attachment and aversion perish, —
and then he attains, God easily.

It is because of attachment and aversion, that a man gets
entangled in the worldly snare. All spiritual disciplines, are
practised in order to, wipe out attachment and aversion.* When -
attachment and aversion are wiped out, the ever-present Lord is
naturally attained without effort. The reason is, that He is not
realized through unreal, but is realized, by renouncing the unreal. |
The unreal world seems to exist, because of attachment and
aversion. It automatically goes, into extinction. So, if a striver is
neither attached to nor has an aversion, for the perishable world, he
will naturally attain salvation 1.e., will be released, from bondage.

Appendix—Equanimity in favourable and unfavourable
circumstances and freedom from the feeling of pleasure
and pain is to be ‘nirdvandva’ viz., free from dualities (pairs
of opposites).

* The only desired aim of all spiritual practices of Yogis is to get rid of
attachment to the entire world (Srimadbhagavata 3/32/27).
"
638,"Verse 4} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 597 -
In identification (of the self with the non-self), if there is
predominance of the sentient, there is eagerness (curiosity) and -
if there is predominance of the insentient, there is desire. A man
has the real hunger for the imperishable Divinity but he has the
relish for the perishable because he wants to satisfy the hunger ""
of the imperishable by the perishable. This duality between
hunger and relish strengthens a man’s worldly bondage. When ~
his attachment and aversion to the world are wiped out, then his -
thirst for Self-realization is fulfilled and his desire is wiped out |
and he becomes free from dualities (pairs of opposites). : oo
Link:—IJn the first half of the second verse of this chapter, 7
the Lord declared, ""Disciplines of Knowledge and Action—both
lead to salvation."" The Lord, explains the same point, in the -
next two verses.

Comment:—
'Sankhyayogau prthagbalah pravadanti na panditah'—Arjuna,
in the first verse of this chapter, called the method of gaining
knowledge from the wise who have realized the Truth, having
renounced actions, as Karmasannyasa. In the second verse, the
Lord, attaching importance to His principle, called it Sannyasa
and Karmasannyasa. Now, the Lord calls it ‘Sankhya’. By
Sankhya, He means establishment in the self by discriminating,
the self from the body. According to Him, ‘Sannyasa’ and
"
639,"598 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [ChapterS  -
‘Sankhya’', are synonyms, in which there is no need of renouncing ___.
actions physically. -

What Arjuna calls 'Karmasannyasa' is undoubtedly, a kind
of 'Sankhya’ mentioned by the Lord, because after receiving
instruction from a preceptor a striver, comes to know reality,

_ about the body and the soul.

The Lord, by the term 'Balah’, means to convey that those,
who say that Sankhya (Discipline of Knowledge) and Karmayoga ~~
(Discipline of Action), produce different results, are children viz.,
and ignorant, even though, they may be aged and intellectual. ee
But the wise, say that both of these produce the same result,
though they may be different, as means. The Lord Himself, 1n the

_ third verse of the third chapter, declared the twofold path—the
path of knowledge and that of action—different as means, but
_ the goal is one. | -

""Ekamapyasthitah samyagubhayorvindate phalam'—In the
Gita, time and again, it has been pointed out, that the result -
of the practice of Sankhyayoga, (Discipline of Knowledge) and
that of Karmayoga (Discipline of Action), is the same. In the ;
twenty-fourth verse of the thirteenth chapter, the Lord declares
that the self or God can be perceived, both through the path of

' knowledge and that of action. In the nineteenth verse of the third |
chapter, it has been mentioned, that a man reaches the Supreme,
through the Discipline of Action, while in the fourth verse of
the twelfth chapter and the thirty-fourth verse of the thirteenth
chapter, it has been mentioned, that strivers reach the Supreme
by following the Discipline of Knowledge. Thus according to
the Lord, both of the paths lead to the same destination.

Appendix—He who knows the scriptural topics but does not
know the reality about ‘Sankhyayoga’ and ‘Karmayoga’ deeply,
is indeed a child viz., is ignorant.

- In whole of the Gita the term ‘phala’ (fruit) for the
imperishable reality has been used only in this verse. The term
"
640,"Verse 5] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 599 -
‘phala’ means ‘result’. Karmayoga and Jianayoga—the Lord’s -
purpose in calling the reality attained by these two disciplines as
‘phala’ is that in these two disciplines, a man’s effort is important.
In Jnanayoga effort in the form of discrimination is important
and in Karmayoga effort in the form of action for the welfare -
of others, is important. A striver’s own effort (labour) proves
fruitful, so it has been called ‘phala’ (fruit). This fruit is not |
perishable. Karmayoga and Jnanayoga—both of them bear fruit -
in the form of Self-realization or attatnment of the Absolute.
‘Performance of duty’ is Karmayoga and ‘Inclination to do ences
nothing’ is Jnanayoga. The reality which is attained by doing
nothing, is attained by discharging one’s duty. ‘Performance’ (to
do) and ‘non-performance’ (not to do) are the means (spiritual
disciplines) and the reality which is attained by these means is
the end (goal). -

The supreme state, which is attained by the Sankhyayogi is also ~

Comment:— |
""Yatsankhyaih prapyate sthanam tadyogairapi gamyate'—In the
second half of the preceding verse, the Lord declared, ""He who
is well established in Sankhyayoga or Karmayoga (performance
of action), gets the fruit of both 1.e., attains God-realization."" The
same fact, is being pointed out by the Lord here, in this verse
by declaring, that the state which is attained by a Sankhyayogi,
is also attained by a Karmayogi. |
The Lord, uses the term ‘api’ (also), here to remove the ;
"
641,"600 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [ChapterS
: doubt of:those people, who think that God can be realized only —
by the Discipline of Knowledge, rather than by the Discipline
of Action. | a |
A striver, through both the disciplines, has to renounce his _
affinity for actions i.e., for active prakrti (nature). A Karmayogi,
in order to, distinguish the sentient from the insentient, has to
use the discrimination of a Jnanayogi, even during spiritual
practice. Similarly, a Jianayogi (Sankhyayogi), has-to adopt the
method of Karmayoga, of not performing action for himself. A
Sankhyayogi's discrimination, is to be utilized to distinguish the ~ =
_ soul, from the body (world); and the actions of a Karmayogi are
performed, in order to, render service to the world. When two _—
strivers—one following the path of Sankhyayoga and the other
of Karmayoga—attain perfection, both of them reach the same _
destination i.e., have liberation (Gita 3/3).

The world is uneven. The closest, worldly relationship is not
free from this unevenness, while the Lord 1s even and uniform. ~~
So, He can be realized by renouncing affinity, for the world.
There are two paths—-of knowledge and of action, available to -
renounce, this affinity. Jnanayoga (the Discipline of Knowledge),
consists in thinking that the real self lacks nothing, and so there
is no question of any desire or attachment in the real self. By -
thinking so, a striver gets detached. In Karmayoga, a striver
renders service to others, with those objects he is attached to and
to those persons he is attached to, without any selfish motive.
Thus in the Discipline of Knowledge, through discrimination,
while in the Discipline of Action through service, affinity for
the world is renounced. |

'Ekam sankhyar ca yogar ca yah pasyati sa pasyati'—In the
first half of the preceding verse, the Lord declared by negative
inference, ""The ignorant, not the wise, speak of the Sankhyayoga
and the Karmayoga, as different."" The same fact, is being pointed
out here, by positive inference when the Lord declares, ""He who
"
642,"Verse 5] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 601 -
sees that the ways (as result) of Sankhyayoga and Karmayoga, |
are one, he sees (truly)."" : -

Thus the gist, of the fourth and the fifth verses, is that the
Lord regards both the Disciplines of Knowledge and Action, -
as independent spiritual disciplines and the fruit of both is ,
God-realization. Those who do not know this reality, are called |
ignorant, while those who know this reality, are designated wise,
by the Lord. : co |

When a striver, attains perfection in anyone of the spiritual
disciplines, he has neither a desire to live, nor fear of death, nor :
a desire to acquire anything, or do anything.

A perishable body, need not be afraid of death, because it _
is decaying all the time, while the self, need not have a desire :
to live, because it is eternal. Then, who is afraid of death and
who has a desire to live? The answer is, that when the self -
identifies Itself with the body, it is afraid of death and it has :
a desire, to live. Both of these, (the desire to live and the fear 7
of death) can be wiped out, by the: Discipline of Knowledge
(discrimination).

The self, lacks nothing; therefore, it has no desire to acquire
anything, and so no desire to do any work. But when it identifies |
itself with a body, It feels the lack. Then, It has a desire to acquire,
something or the other; and in order to acquire that, It has to act.

The desire to acquire and to act, perishes through Karmayoga.

When either the Discipline of Knowledge or the Discipline
of Action, attains perfection, the desires to live, to acquire and
to act, and the fear of death, totally perish.

Appendix—Sankhyayoga and Karmayoga—both disciplines
being worldly are one and the same. In Sankhyayoga a striver
gets established in the self and being established in the self,
matter (non-self) is renounced. In Karmayoga a striver renounces -
"
643,"602 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [ChapterS
matter and having renounced matter (non-self), he gets established
in the self. In-this way the result of both—Sankhyayoga and
Karmayoga is attainment of divinity (pure-consciousness) viz.,
Self-realization. ;
To apply the body in the service of the world is Karmayoga
and to detach the self from the body is Jnanayoga. Either apply
the body in the service of the world or get the self detached
from the body—both will bear the same fruit viz., by both these _
disciplines, having renounced affinity for the world, one will get
established in the self. 7 ees
Here in the fourth and fifth verses the first half of the fourth
verse has connection with the second half of the fifth verse and
the first half of the fifth verse has connection with the second
half of the fourth verse. _
Karmayoga, Jnanayoga and Bhaktiyoga—out of these three
disciplines, Jnanayoga and Bhaktiyoga are more popular but
there is less popularity of Karmayoga. The Lord in the Gita ~
also declares, “This Karmayoga through long lapse of time is
lost to the world” (Gita 4/2). Therefore about Karmayoga, there
is a general belief that this is ‘not an independent means of God-
realization and so a striver following the Discipline of Action
afterwards either follows Jnanayoga or Bhaktiyoga as— .

A person should perform actions by the time till he develops
dispassion for pleasures (he becomes eligible for Jnanayoga) or
he develops faith in listening to My pastime and life story (he
becomes qualified for Bhaktiyoga).
But here the Lord declares that just like Jnanayoga, Karmayoga
is also an independent discipline for God-realization. Besides
these fourth and fifth verses in several other verses also the
Lord has mentioned that Karmayoga is an independent means’ _
"
644,"Verse 5] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 603
to attain Self-realization or the Supreme peace or salvation or
God-realization as—‘tatsvayarh yogasamsiddhah kalenatmani
vindati’ (4/38), “yogayukto munirbrahma nacirenadhigacchati’
(5/6), ‘yajiiayacaratah karma samagratn praviliyate’ (4/23),
‘jnanagnidagdhakarmanamh tamahuh panditarh budhah’ (4/19);
‘yuktah karmaphalam tyaktva Santimapnoti naisthikim’ (5/12).

In Srimadbhagavata also Karmayoga has been mentioned as.
an independent means for God-realization—

svadharmastho yajan yajiiairanasih kama uddhava |

na yati svarganarakau yadyanyanna samacaret _

(11/20/10)

‘He, who being situated in his own ‘dharma’ (duty) and
renouncing the desire for pleasure, worships God by the
performance of his duty and does not do any action with an | (en
interested motive, has not to go to heaven or hell viz., he is
freed from the bondage of actions. -

asminiloke vartamanah svadharmastho’naghah éucih

(11/20/11) ~

The Karmayogi being situated in his own dharma (duty) in ,
spite of discharging all his duties in this world, being free from
the fruit of sinful and virtuous actions, attains Self-realization
or Supreme devotion (Parabhakti). |

It means that Karmayoga (the Discipline of Action) makes a
striver qualified for Jaanayoga (the Discipline of Knowledge) or
Bhaktiyoga (the Discipline of Devotion) and also independently
leads him to salvation. In other words it can be said that Karmayoga
is a means for Jaanayoga or Bhaktiyoga and is also an end viz.,
it can lead to Self-realization or Supreme devotion.

Link:—In the second verse of this chapter, the Lord declared,
the Discipline of Action to be better, than the Discipline of
"
645,"608 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 5
stumbling blocks to spiritual progress (Gita 2/44). When we
- feel happy, after seeing a man happy, our desire for pleasure
perishes, because we have .become happy without enjoying
pleasure. Similarly, our desire for prosperity perishes, because
we spend money (prosperity) and material, naturally according to
our best capability to remove the suffering of a sad person, by
being sad with him, as we identify ourselves with him. In such
happiness or pity, there is an uncommon relish, which conduces
a man to renounce affinity, for actions and objects, and then he
(the self) realizes his identity with God. :
: ""Yogayuktah'—The Karmayogi, whose mind is pure, who
has controlled the body, who has subdued his senses and whose
self is the Self of all beings, is called ""Yogayuktah' (devoted to
the path of action). , a
A striver, is not naturally inclined towards spiritual discipline,
because his aim and his inclination, are different. So long as, there 7
is importance of the world in the mind, there is struggle between .
the aim and inclination. Generally, a striver's aim is to realize God,
Who is imperishable while his inclination is towards perishable, -
worldly beings, objects and circumstances. When his aim and
inclination, are identified, spiritual discipline 1s automatically :
practised, ‘speedily. Here the term 'Yogayuktah' (devoted to the
path of action), has been used for such a Karmayogi, whose aim
and inclination, have become one 1.e., God-realization.
In Karmayoga, there is no desire in the least, for fruit of
actions, but there is certainly an aim, to be achieved. The fruit
and the aim, are different. An aim is one, which can be ever
achieved by everyone. Thus, one's aim is God-realization and !
He can be realized, without any action and practice. The fruit is -
perishable, while God is eternal. A Karmayogi, does not desire the
perishable, because this desire is an obstacle to God-realization.
When a Karmayogi’s, only aim is God-realization, he is called
_ 'Yogayukta’ (devoted to the path of action).
"
646,"Verse 7] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 609 .
He, who has been called 'Yogayuktah' here, has been called

""Yogarudhah' (one who has attained to Yoga), in the fourth verse

of the sixth chapter. : -
'Kurvannapi na lipyate'—A Karmayogl, in spite of performing

actions is not bound by actions. A sense of mine, for actions,

desire for the fruit of actions, and for pleasure, and a sense |

of doership* bind a man, to actions. The gist is, that desire to

acquire something or the other, leads, a man to bondage. As a

Karmayogi, has no desire to acquire anything, he is not tainted

(bound) 1.e., his actions change into inaction.
A Sankhyayogi, is not bound by actions, because he thinks

that it is the modes which are acting on the modes (Gita 3/28); -

while a Karmayog! is not bound, as he performs actions, for the

welfare of others, without any selfish motive. —
The term ‘api’ (even), shows that a Karmayogi remains

untainted, not only during the performance of action but also -

during their non-performance (Gita 4/18). He has no interest,

in the performance or non-performance of actions (Gita 3/18). ,

He always remains, untainted. | -
It means that, a Sankhyayogi having renounced his affinity

for the insentient, identifies himself with the sentient, while a

Karmayogi identifies his so-called body, mind, senses, objects

and actions etc., with the world 1.e., instead of regarding them

as of his and for himself, he regards them as the world and

for the world. With this attitude of mind, he cannot have any

egoistic feeling, in providing comfort to others, doing good to

them and performing righteous acts, for them. Therefore, while

performing action, he has no sense of doership 1.e., is not tainted

by action. | |
* The Lord while describing Karmayoga, in the forty-seventh verse of the

second chapter by the expression 'Ma karmaphalaheturbhth’' means to say that a

striver should renounce the sense of mine, the desire for pleasure and the sense

of doership while by the expression 'Ma phalesu kadacana' He exhorts him to

renounce the desire for the fruit of action.
"
647,"610 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
Appendix—When a Karmayogi having renounced affinity for
the body, senses and mind (inner sense) realizes his identity with
all beings, then in spite of performing actions, the egoistic notion  —~
does not persist in him. Being free from egoism, the actions
performed by him don’t lead to bondage (Gita 18/17).

The Saakhyayogi, who knows the truth, believes, even though
seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, walking, sleeping,
breathing,: speaking, emitting, grasping, opening and closing the
eyes, that he does nothing; he holds that the senses move among
the sense-objects. 8-9
Comment:—
'Tattvavit yuktah'—Here, this expression, stands for the wise
striver following the Discipline of Knowledge, who has realized
the truth, that all actions are performed by prakrti (nature) and
he has no affinity for them, he is merely a witness, of the
activities of senses.
A 'Tattvavit' (knower of the truth), is he who thinks, that
he (the self) is not the doer; is different from the body, senses,
"
648,"Verse 8-9] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 611
mind, intellect and life-breath, which ‘perform the. activities. |
In fact, a man (the self) is a non-doer, but by an error he |
regards the self, as a doer (Gita 3/27). Actually all the cosmic, as -
well as individual actions are performed by Nature. But a man, |
by identifying himself with the body, regards its action as his |
action. So long as, he has in the least a sense of doership, he is
called a striver. But when he realizes, that the Self is not at all
the doer, he is called a great soul, who knows the truth. As a
person, having awakened from sleep, has nothing to do with a
dream, so has a great soul, having known the truth, no affinity
for actions performed by the body and the senses etc.
Such a great soul, knows the truth that the self is different
from the modes of nature by which actions, are performed. The
self, is the base and illuminator of all the objects and actions -
etc., It pervades everywhere, and does not undergo any change,
while objects and actions, undergo. The same fact, of distinction -
between the nature (Ksetra).and soul (Ksetrajna), has been pointed
out by the Lord, in the sixteenth verse of the second chapter,
in the fourth and the fifth verses of the seventh chapter and in 7
the second, the nineteenth, the twenty-third and the thirty-fourth
verses, Of the thirteenth chapter.
‘PaSyafisrnvansprSaii......unmisannimisannapi'—Here, the five
actions—-seeing, hearing, touching, smelling and eating, pertain
to five senses (eye, ear, skin, nose and tongue), while walking,
grasping, speaking and emitting, these four actions relate to
the five organs of actions*—feet, hands, tongue, genital organ
and anus. Sleeping, is an activity of the mind, breathing of
life-breath, opening and closing the eyes, of the sub-life-breath
named Kurma.
Thus, by mentioning the above thirteen actions, the Lord has
* Here the description of the five organs of action has been included in four
actions, i.e., within ‘emitting’ the actions of both the genital organ and the anus
have been included.
"
649,"612 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
described all possible actions performed by sense-organs, organs
of action, mind, life-breath and sub-life-breath. It means that all
actions are performed by the body, senses, mind, intellect and -
life-breath etc., the evolutes of nature, rather than by the self.
Secondly, it also denotes that a Sankhyayogi can. also perform
other acts, such as eating or drinking, business, preaching,
writing, reading, hearing and thinking etc., and also other acts
for maintaining the body according to caste, order of life, nature
and circumstances etc.

A man, considers himself a doer of those acts, which he
performs intentionally i.e., by applying his mind and intellect
etc., such as reading, writing, thinking, seeing and eating etc.
But there are several other activities, such as breathing, opening
and closing the eyes, which are performed unintentionally. Then, -
why has the Lord mentioned, in this verse, that a man should
not regard himself as a doer of these acts? The answer is, that -
breathing is a natural activity, yet in breath-restraint (pranayama) :
etc., breathing becomes an intentional activity. Similarly, eyes can
also be opened and shut intentionally. So the Lord, has mentioned -
that a man should not hold, that he 1s a doer. Secondly, the Lord
by mentioning, breathing, opening and closing the eyes, wants
to convey, that as a man during these activities thinks that he
does nothing, so should he consider himself a non-doer, while
other activities are performed.
‘All the above-mentioned activities, cannot be performed,
without a base and an illuminator. The Lord, mentions these __
activities, in order to draw the attention of the strivers, to the
self, which in spite of being the base, and illuminator of all
these activities, does nothing.

""Indriyanindriyarthesu vartanta iti dharayan'—The question
arises, how are actions performed, when there is no doership
in the self. The Lord, answers the question, by declaring that
actions are performed, when senses move among the sense-objects
"
650,"Verse 8-9] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 613
1.e., the self remains the non-doer (untainted).
The term ‘Indriyani'’ (senses) includes the sense-organs,
the organs of action, mind, life-breath and sub-life-breath etc. _
There are five objects of senses—sound, touch, sight, taste and
smell. The senses move among these objects. All the senses and -
objects of senses, are the evolutes of nature. So all the actions
are performed, by nature. The Lord declares:—
""All kinds of actions are done, by the modes of nature""
(Gita 3/27). :
""All actions are performed by nature, alone” (Gita 13/29).
The senses, and the sense-objects, being the evolutes of modes
of nature, are called modes. So it is said, ""It is the modes, which
are acting on the modes” (Gita 3/28). ""There is no agent, other
than the modes"" (Gita 14/19). It means, that when it is said that _
actions are performed by prakrti (nature), or by modes of nature
or by the senses—these three amount to one and the same. -
Nature, always undergoes modifications, while the self never ”
undergoes any, It ever remains free from a sense of doership.
Nature can never be inactive, while in the self, no action is -
possible. The self is the illuminator of actions, while actions
are subject to illumination.
‘Naiva kijicitkaromiti manyeta'—It means, that the self, was
neither a doer in the past, nor is at present, or will be in future.
Nature is ever active and all actions are performed by Nature, |
while the self, does nothing. But when the self identifies Itself
with the evolute of Nature, and regards the activities of nature
as Its activities, It becomes, a doer (Gita 3/27).
As a man, sitting in the compartment of a moving train, does
not move himself but he cannot remain without covering the
distance covered by the train, while he is seated in a compartment. |
Similarly, when a man, assumes his affinity for the physical
(gross), subtle or causal body, which are the evolutes of active
Nature, he becomes a doer of actions performed by these.
"
651,"614 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5

A Sankhyayogi, never assumes his affinity for the body,
senses and mind etc., so he never regards himself, as a doer (Gita
5/13). As actions, such as the growth of a boy from childhood __
to youth, changing of black hair into grey and white, digestion
of food and weakening or strengthening of a body automatically
take place, so does a Sankhyayogy think, that all other activities
are undertaken naturally and he is not their doer.

In the Gita, a person who regards himself as a doer of actions,
has been spoken of adversely. The Lord declares, ""He whose
mind is deluded by egoism, thinks that he is the doer"" (3/27).
""He who looks upon himself as the doer (agent), he of perverted
mind and untrained understanding, does not see (truly)"" (18/16).
But the Lord praises a person, who sees the self as actionless,
by declaring, ""He who sees that all actions are performed by = __
nature (prakrti) alone, and likewise that the self is not the doer,
he verily sees (13/29). - :

. The Lord, uses the term ‘eva’ (even), in order to convey that

a striver should never think, that he is a doer. By doing so, his
sense of doership comes to an end and his actions change into -
inaction. The same idea, has been conveyed by the Lord, in
the thirty-third verse of the third chapter, by the term 'Cestate’,
which means that his actions are nothing more than mere gestures,
of actions.

The second interpretation of the term ‘Eva’, is that even when
a man identifies himself with the body and considers himself the
doer, he cannot be the doer. It is merely an assumption, which
can never come true. The Lord, in the thirty-first verse of the
thirteenth chapter, declares, ""The imperishable supreme self,
though dwelling in the body, neither acts nor is tainted."" ""The |
soul, residing in Nature experiences pleasure and pain"" (Gita
13/21). In spite of experiencing the modes born of nature, the
man (self), ever remains the same. But he gets tainted, because
he does not see, the self.
"
652,"Verse 8-9] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI ~ 615
The Self, is sentient while the world, including the body,
is insentient. So the self experiences pleasure and pain. Why?
The reason is, that it identifies itself with the body (world) and ~
experiences pleasure and pain. But if It knows, its true nature
that It is imperishable, uniform and untainted, while nature in
the form of the world, the body and pleasures and _ pains, is
perishable, then it cannot be an experiencer, of pleasures and
pains etc.
The Lord, in the twenty-seventh verse of the third chapter,
declared, ""He whose mind is deluded by egoism, thinks that he.
is the doer."" Here, in this verse also, the same fact has been
pointed out by the Lord through a negative inference, when He -
‘declares, ""The Sankhyayogi who knows the truth realizes that he -
does nothing. Here the term, 'Manyeta' (think) does not mean, -
‘to assume’ but 'to realize’. The self, remains a non-doer during
the performance and non-performance of actions, equally. So, the
great soul who has known the truth, realizes that the self ever -
remains the same, as a non-doer, either during the performance or
non-performance of actions. The self, as the base and wluminator,
never undergoes the least modification.
The self, never lacks anything, but when It identifies Itself
with nature, It feels a deficiency in It, and so It desires objects, in
order to make up. In order to fulfil that desire, It becomes a doer.
No action, can be performed without nature, because the
instruments, such as the senses and the body etc., with which
actions are performed, belong to nature. So a doer, has to depend
on them. As a goldsmith howsoever an expert he may be, cannot
prepare ornaments, without instruments, such as an anvil and a
hammer etc. In the same way, a doer cannot perform action without
instruments. Thus qualifications, ability and instruments—all the
three belong to nature (prakrti), but these appear to be in the
"
653,"616 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
self, because of affinity for Nature. The instruments, undergo
modifications while the self ever remains the same. Therefore,
they have no affinity for the self. 7 -
A man (the self) thinks, that he is a doer by assuming his
affinity for Nature, otherwise there is no doership, in him. As
‘ a Brahmana ever remains convinced that he is a Brahmana, so
does a great soul, who knows the truth, believe that he is not
a doer. | |
Appendix—A discriminating Jiianayogi by performing actions
with senses of perception, organs of actions, mind (internal
instrument) and life-breath first assumes ‘I myself do nothing’
and afterwards he realizes it. In fact in the Divine Existence
neither an action is performed nor any activity happens. All
actions performed in the gross, subtle and causal bodies actually —~
take place in Prakrti, not in the self. Therefore the self has no
connection at all with any. action. :
Through ignorance a man by identifying ‘ego’ with the self,
is deluded—‘ahankara vimidhatma’ (Gita 3/27); the same man
by the use of discrimination by detaching the self from ego, __
becomes ‘tattvavit’ (an enlightened soul) viz., he has no sense
of doership. He ever remains established in the divine self.
The self, being deluded by egoism by an error, thinks itself
a doer and is thus bound by actions and their fruit and paves
the way to eighty-four lac forms of lives. Now if a man regards
himself as detached from egoism and does not consider himself
a doer viz., realizes the self as it is, there is no surprise about
his being an enlightened soul (liberated soul). It means that by
assuming the unreal as real, unreal appears to be real, then what
is the surprise, if by accepting the real as real, it is seen real?
In fact when a man assumes the self as a doer and an enjoyer,
at that time also he is neither a doer nor an enjoyer—‘Sarira-
stho’pi kaunteya na karoti na lipyate’ (Gita 13/31). The reason
is that the self is merely an Ever-Existent Reality. In that Reality
"
654,"Verse 8-9] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 617
there is no ego and ego has no existence. Therefore ‘I am a
doer’—however firm this assumption may be but it is certainly
an error. An error is wiped out as soon as it is realized that it —
is an error—this is the rule. A cave may have been dark for :
hundreds of years, but darkness disappears immediately as soon
as there is light, it doesn’t need years and months to disappear. .
Therefore a striver should firmly hold ‘I. am not a doer’. Then
this assumption will no longer remain an assumption but it will
be transformed into realization. |
“In ‘I’ this is identification of both sentient and insentient.”
‘T’ is used for matter (identified ego) and also for the sentient
(self). For example—‘I am a doer’—in it there is perception
of insentient and ‘I am not a doer’—in it (being negation of
matter) the self is perceived. He, who has an eye on matter viz., —
regards ego as the self, is deluded—ahamkara vimudhatma’ and 7
who has an eye on the sentient (the self free from ego) is an
enlightened soul. ;
When a striver at present ‘I myself do nothing’—thus
endeavours to realize the self as a non-doer, he faces a serious
problem. When he remembers virtuous actions done in the past, -
he gets pleased that he had done very good actions. When he |
remembers the forbidden actions done in the past, he becomes
sad that he had done such a sinful act and he had committed
such a blunder. Thus the impression of the past actions make him
happy and sad. In this connection there is a vital point which
needs attention. The self is never a doer—neither at present nor
in the past nor in the future. Therefore a striver should perceive
that as the self is a non-doer at present, so was it in the past. The
reason is that the present has become the past. The self is merely
an Ever Existent Entity in which no performance of action is
possible. Actions are performed only by an ignorant man whose
mind is deluded by egoism (Gita 3/27). A striver feels happy and
sad and is worried by remembering the past actions, that is also
really because of egoism. At present being deluded by egoism
"
655,"618 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 5

viz., by having affinity for egoism, a striver feels happy and sad.

If we perceive from the cursory (gross) point of view, as the

past has no existence now, so are the actions of the past clearly _ |
non-existent. If we perceive from the subtle point of view, we

perceive that as in the past, the present was non-existent, so was

the past also non-existent. Similarly as the past is non-existent

now, so is the present non-existent now. But the entity (the self)

ever exists. It means that the self is totally free from the limits

of past, present and future time. The self transcends the limits

of time. Therefore the self is never a doer. In that entity, which

transcends time and state (condition), imposition of doership and

enjoyership by connecting it with a particular time or situation,

is ignorance. Therefore the memory of the actions performed in

the past, is the memory of the person whose mind is deluded
by egoism rather than of an enlightened soul.

“Naiva kificitkaromi’ means that actions have no existence -
but the entity exists. Therefore a striver should ‘have aneye on ~
that entity. That entity being divine is ‘Knowledge personified’
and being immutable is “bliss personified’. This bliss is integral, _
quiet and immutable (uniform).

Because of the identification of the self with the body, in
every action a man thinks that he himself is the doer as ‘I see, I
hear etc.” An action takes place in the body but a man assumes it
in the self. In the self there is no action, the self is free from the
performance or non-performance of actions (Gita 3/18). Therefore
even when the actions are performed by the body, a man should
have an eye on the self and hold, “I do nothing at all.”

Link:—Having described, in the seventh verse, how a
Karmayogi remains untainted by actions, and in the eighth and
the ninth verses, how a Sankhyayogi remains untainted, the
Lord, in the next verse, describes how a Bhaktiyogi, remains
untainted by actions.

He who performs actions, dedicated to God and abandoning

moistened by water. 10
Comment:— :
'Brahmanyadhaya karmani'—A body, senses, mind, intellect
and the life-breath bestowed by God, belong to Him. Therefore,
how can a devotee, following the path of devotion, regard actions
which are performed by body and senses etc., as his? He holds,
that all actions are being performed by the Lord for Him; he is _
merely an instrument, in His hands. |
The Lord, wants to convey that it is He, Who performs all -
actions with His senses. A striver, realizing this fact, should -
think that He is the doer, of all actions.
' The worldly objects, such as the body etc., are not a person's -
own, these have been acquired, and these abandon him. So these
should be utilized, in rendering service to others, as offerings to
God. A person, cannot keep these as he wishes, neither can he
change these, nor carry these with him, when he leaves his body.
So, it is not honesty on his part, to regard these as his own. They
are the Lord's, and so these should be, accepted as His.
A Karmayogi, offers all actions and objects, to the world,
a Jnanayogi to nature, and a Bhaktiyogi, to God. God, is the
master of both nature and the world, and so it is better to offer
these to Him.
‘Sangam tyaktva karoti yah'—A man, is said to have abandoned
attachment, when he has not, the least, attachment or attraction
for beings, objects, senses, mind, intellect, life-breath and actions,
and has no sense of mine, or desire for them.
"
657,"620 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
Besides ignorance, which has been called the cause of life
and death, in the scriptures from the stand point of the spiritual
discipline attachment to the modes, is the chief cause of an — ,
embodied soul's birth, in good and evil bodies (Gita 13/21).
Ignorance, is based on attachment, therefore, when attachment
is renounced, ignorance also perishes. Desire springs, from
attachment (Gita 2/62), and is the root of all sins (Gita 3/37).
Thus here in this verse, it is mentioned, that attachment which
is the root of sins, should be abandoned otherwise a man will
go on committing sins. In its absence, he incurs no sin.
A man's, affinity for action, is not renounced, so long as, he
derives pleasure by performing it, and remains attached to its fruit,
it is rather enhanced. Attachment of a person does not consist in
merely desire for fruit of action, but also in being called good by = —
others. So, action should be performed, without the least desire
for pleasure, comfort or honour etc. If there is desire for getting —
pleasure, anyhow in the least, then that action is for one’s self. -
'Lipyate na sa papena padmapatramivambhasa'—A devotee,
following the Discipline of Devotion, while living in the world -
and performing actions, in order to offer these to God, is not
tainted, (bound) in the same way, as a lotus-leaf living in water
is not soiled by water.
Desire for the world, and having a disinclination for God,
is the root of all sins. Desire, springs from attachment. Where,
there is no attachment, there is no desire and so sins cannot be
committed, without attachment.
All undertakings are covered by defects (evils), as fire by
smoke (Gita 18/48). But, he who has renounced, hope, desire
and attachment, becomes free from all defects. When actions
are performed, in order to be offered to God, having abandoned
attachment, a striver becomes free, from the accumulation of all
sins (Gita 9/27-28). Therefore, a Bhaktiyogi, totally becomes,
free from sins.
"
658,"Verse 10] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 621

Here, the term ‘papena’ (sin), stands for the fruit of past
actions, in the form of virtue or vice, which cause the soul to
be born in good and evil bodies. A Bhaktiyogi, is never tainted Se
(bound) by that fruit, in the form of virtue and vice. The same
fact, has been pointed out by the Lord, in the twenty-eighth verse
of the ninth chapter, when He declares, ""Thus, shalt thou be freed,
from the bonds of actions, yielding good and evil fruits.”

Appendix—Here God endowed with attributes has been called
‘Brahma’ (the Absolute). It means that God is all—He is endowed
with attributes and is also attributeless; He is endowed with form ~ .
and is also formless. In His entirety all characteristics are included
(Gita 7/29-30). In Srimadbhagavata also Brahma (attributeless-
formless), Paramatma (with attributes and formless) and Bhagavan
(endowed with attributes and form)—all the three have been -
mentioned as one.* It means that within ‘Saguna’ (God endowed
with attributes) Brahma, Paramatma and Bhagavan—all the three -
are included, but within “Nirguna’ (attributeless) only Brahma -
is included because in ‘Nirguna’ there is negation of attributes.
Therefore ‘Nirguna’ is limited while ‘Saguna’ is entire. -

“Vaisnavas’ (the devotees of Lord Visnu) call the function
of the Lord endowed with attributes and form ‘Brahmotsava’
(function of the Absolute). Arjuna has also addressed Lord Krsna
as ‘Brahma’—‘param brahma param dhama pavitrarh paramain
bhavan’ (Gita 10/12). In the Gita Brahma has been mentioned
by three names—‘Om, ‘tat’ and ‘sat’ (17/23). Because of the
relationship between the name and the ‘nami’ (person having the
name) He is proved to be ‘saguna’ (endowed with attributes).

The Yogis, having discarded attachment, perform actions,

merely with the body, mind, intellect and senses, for the

purification of the self. 11

Comment:— :
""Yoginah'—Here the term 'Yoginah’, stands for Karmayogts.

The Yogis, who perform actions, offering these to God, are called

Bhaktiyogis, while those, who perform these in order to render

service to the world, without any selfish motive, are called,

'Karmayogis'. A Karmayogi, while performing actions, regards _

his so-called body, senses and mind etc., as the worlds’, and not

his own, as they have their identity, with the world. os
""Kayena manasa buddhya kevalairindriyairapi'—In fact, the -

body, senses, mind and intellect etc., which a common man

regards as his own, are not his, because these have been acquired -
from. the world and they will abandon him. So, it is an error

on his part to assume, that these are his. All of these have their

identity, with the world.

: If we give a serious thought to it, we come to realise that

the body etc., are not ours, in anyway. They belong either to

God or to nature (prakrti); or to the world. Thus, it is an error

to regard these as ours, and to have a sense of mineness with

them. The term 'Kevalaih’ (merely), has been used here to root

- out this sense of mineness with them.

Here, the term 'Kevalaih’, being plural, is an adjective, for |
senses. But, it does not mean that sense of mineness for mere
senses, is to be renounced, it means that sense of mineness for
the body, mind, intellect and the entire world, is to be abandoned,
for which a person, has attachment. When a girl, is married
"
660,"Verse 11] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI , 623
into a family, her relationship with her in-laws, is automatically
established. In the same way, when a man is attached to any
worldly object, he gets attached to the entire world. So the term ae
‘Kevalaih’, should be taken as abandonment of sense of mineness
for the body, senses, mind and intellect.

In fact, a doer (agent) himself, should become detached. By ,
doing so, his attachment for body, senses, mind and intellect etc.,
is totally abandoned. The reason is, that the body, senses and
mind etc., are, quite different from the self. A sense of mineness
with these is merely assumed, it is not natural.

In the Discipline of Action, renunciation of the desire for
fruit is important, (Gita 5/12). Common people, perform actions
in order to reap their fruit, but a_Karmayogi performs these to
root out attachment to the fruit. But a person, who regards the -
body, senses, mind,. intellect and life-breath etc., as his own, -
cannot renounce, the desire for fruit,* as he assumes, that when -
the body etc., are his, he should also reap the fruit of actions,
performed by him. Therefore, if a striver wants to wipe out the
desire for fruit, it is indispensable for him, that he should, not -
regard the body etc., as his own. :

When it rains, it is useful for crops and people etc., but,
rain is not aware of the fact, that it is falling and doing good,
to the world. Similarly, senses should not have a feeling of
doership, when they render service to others. But, if some service
is rendered by the senses, body, mind or intellect, and gives us
a sensation of elation, it means that the service has not been
performed with a feeling of detachment. On the contrary it is a
sign of attachment and possession.

‘Sangam tyaktvatmasuddhaye'—[Vide the explanation in the
tenth verse, for the expression 'Sangarh tyaktva.]

* If a person has no desire for the fruit but regards the body etc., as his own,
the fruit of action becomes his motive which has been forbidden by the Lord by
the declaration, “Let not the fruit of action be thy motive"" (Gita 2/47).
"
661,"624 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5

Generally, it is thought that a heart is purified when sins.
(accumulated sin), volatility of mind and ignorance, are removed.

But, in fact, purification of the heart, consists in total renunciation — |
of attachment, (or a sense of mine), with the body, senses, mind

and intellect. The body, etc., never regards us as theirs but, we

assume these, as ours. This assumption of mineness, is impurity.

Saint Tulasidasa in the Ramacaritamanasa declares, ""Let the filth

of the sense of mine, be burnt” (7/117 A). So, heart gets purified

when there is total renunciation of affinity, of an egoistic notion

and sense of mine etc.

The term 'Kevalaih’, denotes the aim of renunciation of the
sense of ‘mine’, with the body, senses, mind and intellect, while
the expression 'Atmasuddhaye’, denotes total renunciation of a
sense of ‘mine’. When a striver's aim, is to renounce the sense
of mine, yet this sense prevails, in its subtle form. When, this
sense of mine in its subtle form, also perishes totally, it is known -
as a state of purification of the inner sense. ;

The sense of mine, also resides in egoism. When this sense
of mine, is totally renounced, egoism also becomes free from -
this sense of mine, and the self (heart) is, totally purified.

""Karma kurvanti'—A Karmayog}, performs actions to totally
renounce, a sense of mine, in-its subtle form, from the body,
senses, mind and intellect etc. |

So long as, a person has a desire for the fruit of action,
and so long as, he assumes that the body, senses and mind
etc., are his own, he cannot be liberated from, the bondage of
actions. Therefore, a Karmayog! performs actions for the welfare

_of others, without having a desire for the fruit of actions, and
without regarding the objects of action (body, senses, mind and
intellect etc.,) as his own. For a sage, who wishes to attain to
Yoga, action (for the welfare of others), is said to be, the means
(Gita 6/3). The more, he continues working for the welfare of
others, the more his attachment and sense of mine, are renounced
"
662,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 625
and thus his self (heart) is purified. |
_ Appendix—The heart is not purified by trying to purify it _ |
because it is not purified so long as we regard it as ours, since
the assumption of mineness with it is the main impurity. Therefore
in the Ramacaritamanasa it. has been declared, ‘Let the filth of
mineness be burnt!’ (Manasa, Uttara. 117 A). The Lord here also
by using the term ‘kevalaih’ has mentioned not to have the sense
_ of mineness with the inner sense. Punfication of the inner sense
consists in total renunciation of the sense of mineness with the
body, senses, mind and intellect. Therefore Karmayogis act in
a detached manner in order to wipe out the sense of mineness
totally from the inner sense. They don’t perform any action for
their own Self. The reason is that so long as the sense of mine
persists, mere actions are performed, but Karmayoga is not -
practised. When actions are not performed for one’s own self, -
then Karmayoga proceeds towards Self-realization. -
A Karmayog! first acts aiming at freedom fron: the sense |
of mineness, then his aim is achieved. -

glory of Karmayoga by positive, as well as negative inference.

The Karmayogi attains everlasting peace (God-realization), by

Comment:-—
""Yuktah'—The meaning of this term, is taken according to the
"
663,"626 __ SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 5

context. In the eighth verse of this chapter, the term 'Yuktah' has

been used for the 'Sankhyayog1’, who does not regard himself, as

a doer of actions, while here it has been used for the Karmayogi, Te
who has renounced the fruit of action.

All strivers, whose aim:is to attain equanimity, are ""Yuktah' or
""Yog1. In the present verse, it has been used for a Karmayogi, who

_ having a determinate intellect, has renounced worldly desires.

'‘Karmaphalam tyaktva'—This expression, means the
renunciation of desire for fruit and also, renunciation of attachment,
because 1n fact it is not the fruit of acttons which is renounced,
it is desire forthe fruit of actions, which is renounced. That
fruit may be reaped, either immediately or in the future. When
a striver, regards nothing as his, does nothing for him, desires
nothing for him, it means that he has renounced, the desire for -
the fruit of actions. | ,

A man's prarabdha (fate), is determined by the hoard of his ;
past actions, and according to that he is born in good and evil
wombs. In human life, actions which are performed, produce
impressions that are added to the stock. But, when he renounces ~
attachment to the fruit of actions, such actions cannot bear fruit,
like roasted seed and these change, into inaction (Gita 4/20).
Because of the effect of actions, which are performed without
desire for the fruit of actions, the latent impressions of the old
actions, (accumulated of past actions), -are reduced to nothing
(Gita 4/23). Thus, the cause of his rebirth, melts away.

Fruit of actions, is of four kinds:—

(1) Visible—The fruit of present actions, which is visible
immediately, as satisfying one's hunger after having a meal, is
a visible fruit. :

(2) Unforeseen—Fruit, which will be reaped in future, in
the form of favourable or unfavourable circumstances etc., here
or hereafter. This fruit is unforeseen. At present the action goes
to the accumulated stock of actions.
"
664,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 627

(3) Received as fruit of past actions:—The body (with its caste,
order of life) wealth, property and favourable or unfavourable
‘circumstances, which have been bestowed upon us, as a result _ |
of past deeds. .

(4) Unréceived, fruits yet to be reaped in future:—Favourable
and unfavourable circumstances, which we have to receive in
future as ordained by destiny (prarabdha karma).

Out of the four kinds, of fruit of action, the visible and the ©
unforeseen, depend on present actions, while the received and
unreceived ones, depend on prarabdha karma. When a striver,
does not desire the visible fruit, nor does he feel displeased or
pleased, having received it; and does not expect the unforeseen
one; nor is he attached to the received, fruit nor feels happy or
sad having received it, and does not desire, the unreceived one, -
then, it is said that he has renounced, the fruit of action.

Common people, perform actions with a desire for the fruit 7
of actions, and during performance, they go on thinking of that :
desire. As a businessman makes transactions for profit and goes
on thinking about profit and feels happy with profit, and sad ~
with loss; similarly, all people perform actions, having desire for
favourable gains, such as wife, son, riches, honour and praise
etc. But, a Karmayogi performs actions, by renouncing desire,
for fruit. .

Now a question arises, why should a man perform actions,
if he has no desire? The answer is, that none can ever remain
still for even a moment, without performing action (Gita 3/5).

Even if, it is accepted that a man can abandon actions, to a
great degree, even then, so long as, he is attached to the world,
he will think of sense-objects and that is also, an action. The
thought, of sense-objects, finally leads him to ruin (Gita 2/62-63).
Therefore, so long as, a striver does not renounce attachment
totally, he cannot be liberated, from the bondage of action. The
old attachment, is wiped out by performance of action, while,
"
665,"628 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
the new one does not arise, when actions are performed for the
welfare of others, and without any selfish motive.

In fact, it is ignorance if actions are performed with desire
for fruit, because firstly actions and their fruits are perishable, oe |
and secondly, these will bear fruit, according to fate whether
desired or not. A man cannot have, increase or decrease in fruit,
by mere desire. |

When actions are performed for the welfare of others, without
desire for fruit, affinity for these, is renounced. A Karmayogi, does
not perform actions without an aim, like an insane man, but he
performs these having a high aim of God-realization. To realize

his aim, he works for the welfare of others. As he is not attached

to the body, he performs actions, promptly and scrupulously,
without such evils, as indolence and heedlessness.

If actions, which are performed, to acquire the worldly -
materials, are performed, for the welfare of the world, with the aim
of God-realization, and without any selfish motive, these actions _
can lead a man to God-realization. In the, twentieth verse of the
third chapter, it has been declared, ""Janaka and others attained
perfection, verily by action only,"" while in the third verse of the
sixth chapter, it has been stated, ""Action is said, to be the means |
with a sage, who wishes to attain to Yoga."" These facts, reveal
that God can be realized by actions. Parvati and Manu-Satarupa
etc., also realized God, through performance of actions, in the
form of penance. It is also mentioned in the scriptures, that He
can be realized through chanting, meditation, good company,
study of scriptures and cognition etc. On the contrary, it is also
mentioned, that He cannot be realized, through actions, such as
penance etc., (Gita 11/53). How to reconcile the two?

The answer is, that in fact God is not attained through any
action. He is also, not a fruit of action. God pervades everywhere,
"
666,"Verse: 12] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 629 |
everything, incident, circumstance and person etc., all the time.
He is ever-attainable to everyone, and everyone abides in Him,
only. No one can ever be separate, from Him. But, a man being oo .
attached to perishable body, senses, mind, intellect and objects
etc., which are evolutes of insentient nature, has a disinclination
for God, Who is his. Spiritual discipline, is to be practised, in
order to wipe out this attachment or affinity.
Through the performance of penance etc., when this affinity for
the insentient, is renounced, God, Who is ever-attainable, is attained.
This affinity can be very easily renounced, when actions are
performed for the welfare of the world, without any selfish motive.
The sentient and eternal Lord, cannot be bought, for all the
wealth of the world. All the worldly objects, stand nowhere, when
all of them are compared to the imperishable Lord. Moreover, a -
thing which is bought for a particular amount, is cheaper than
that amount. Thus if God is realized by performing actions, it -
means, that He is cheaper than actions. ~
Here is a vital point, which calls for attention. Generally,
strivers during spiritual practice depend on and have affinity for ~
the body, senses, mind, intellect etc., with which, they perform
that spiritual activity. So long as, they have affinity for these 1.e.,
the insentient, they cannot realize God. As soon as, this affinity 7
is renounced, God is realized. God-realization is not possible,
through matter, rather it is by snapping our connection with it.
The body, senses, mind and intellect etc., belong to the same
class, to which the world belongs. So these should be utilized,
in rendering service to the world (this is Karmayoga). A striver,
should not accept his affinity for these, nor should be depend on
them, as he cannot get rid of the unreal, by having affinity for
the unreal. Actions are performed, without any selfish motive,
in order to renounce affinity, for the unreal. When this affinity
is totally renounced, disinclination for God perishes, and ever-
attained God, is realized. :
"
667,"630 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 5

'Santim4pnoti naisthikim'—It has stood the test of experience,
that when a person has neither desire, for the worldly objects, nor
is attached to them, he attains peace. Even, during sound sleep
when the world is forgotten, a man experiences peace. Similarly, - |
one attains peace, when he completes any assignment or task,
such as the marriage of his daughter. If he renounces his affinity,
(desire and attachment) during wakefulness, he will attain peace.

But if he enjoys this peace, he cannot attain everlasting peace
or the supreme peace,* because this peace is not an end, but a
means to attain the supreme peace, called Yoga (Gita 6/3).

So long as, a striver remains attached to peace, which he
attains by renouncing his affinity for the world, he is bound
(Gita 14/6) and he cannot attain, the supreme, uniform and
eternal peace. _

-‘Ayuktah kamakarena phale sakto nibadhyate'—The term
‘Ayuktah', has been used for a person, who works with a selfish -
motive. Such a person, because of his several desires, being -
attached to fruit of actions, has to follow, the cycle of birth and
death. A person cannot acquire things etc., merely by having -
a desire. Secondly he cannot possess these forever, even if he

_ has acquired them. So, it is futile to have a desire for acquiring

objects etc., saint Tulasidasa in the Vinaya-Patrika declares, ""All

worldly objects will abandon you, in the end; it is better, if you
abandon, them right now"" (198).

It does not mean, that their physical abandonment
(renouncement) leads to salvation, or God-realization. Had it
been so, all persons who left their bodies, (at the time of death)
would have attained salvation. But, it is not so. In fact it is
desire, a sense of mine and attachment to these which are to be
renounced, because these lead to bondage i.e., end to the cycle

: *This everlasting (supreme) peace is God-realization. It has been
called ‘eternal peace’ (9/31), ‘the supreme peace’ (4/39; 18/62) and ‘peace’
(5/29, 2/70-71) in the Gita.
"
668,"Verse 13] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 631
of birth and death. When actions are performed, for the welfare
of others, their flow is towards others, and any assumed affinity
for them, is easily renounced. Se
Appendix—lIn fact practice of the spiritual discipline in order
to attain salvation or God-realization is also attachment to the
fruit of action. A man has formed the habit to do a piece of work
with the desire for its fruit; therefore it is said that one should
practise spiritual discipline for salvation or God-realization.
In fact spiritual practice is needed in order to wipe out
attachment to the world; otherwise salvation is axiomatic. The
Lord is ever attained. God-realization is not the fruit of an action. :
Therefore the yearning for the performance of action in order to
attain God 1s also the desire for fruit.
A striver should not think that this spiritual practice will a
bear this fruit. Desiring the fruit is an attachment to the fruit
which does not allow the spiritual discipline to be followed ;
scrupulously. Therefore instead of thinking of the fruit, a striver
should practise spiritual discipline promptly which will naturally
lead him to divine perfection. If a striver goes on thinking for -
the fruit, he will not attain divine perfection.
_ We shall attain the transcendental state or the desireless state
and then we shall be happy—in this way the desire to derive
happiness or pleasure is also the desire for fruit which hinders
a striver from becoming transcendental and desireless.

The embodied (soul) having controlled the senses, and having
renounced the performance of all actions by discrimination, in the
abode of nine gates, neither acting nor causing others to act, he
rests happily in the self. 13 |
Comment:— | |

""VaSi dehi'—When a man is attached, to the senses, mind and
intellect etc., these control him, but when he renounces attachment
to them, they remain under his control. A Sankhyayogi being
so, is called 'Vasr'. .

So long as, a man has the least attachment for the evolutes of
nature, (body, senses etc.,) he has to remain under the control of
nature (Gita 3/5). Prakrti (nature), ever remains active. Therefore,

a man cannot refrain himself, from performing actions, so long

as he is, attached to Nature. But a Sankhyayogi, who is not at _
all attached to the gross, subtle and causal bodies, the evolutes of —
Nature, do not become the performer of actions. Though sucha -
Sankhyayog!, has not the least attachment for the body, yet,heis =~
called the embodied one, as he seems so, to the common people.

""Navadvare pure'—Two ears, two eyes, two nostrils, a -

_ mouth—these seven, located: in the upper part of the body,
while the genital organ and the anus located in the lower part

| of the trunk, these nine openings, have been called, the nine
gates. This body has been called the city. of nine gates, in order
to clarify the point, that as the abode and those who inhabit the
abode, are different, so are a body and the soul. As a person,
living in the city does not regard activities undertaken in the
city, as his own, so does a Sankhyayogi not regard activities of
the body, as his own.

'Sarvakarmani manasa sannyasya'—Here, the expression
‘Sarvakarmant’, stands for the thirteen types of actions performed,
with the body, senses, mind, intellect and life-breath, as described

| in the eighth and ninth verses, of this chapter.
Here the expression 'Manasa sannyasya’ means ‘renouncing
"
670,"Verse 13] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 633
the doership in actions through discrimination’. If the meaning of
the expression ts taken as ‘renouncing mental actions’ only, it will
not be proper, because according to the Gita, ‘renouncing mental -
action’ mentally, is also an activity of the mind (Gita 18/15). So, there
is doership of this mental activity. Therefore the renouncement
of actions mentally, means renouncing the affinity of doership
through discrimination. A Sankhyayogi does not regard himself,
as the doer, he leaves the doership in the body. |
'Naiva kurvanna karayan'—A Sankhyayogi becomes, neither
a doer himself, nor does he make others, doers. As he is, not in
the least attached to the body, senses, mind and intellect etc., he
cannot regard actions performed by them, as his. In the eighth
verse of this chapter also the Lord has pointed out the same fact,
when He declares, ""The man who knows the truth, thinks that -
he does nothing at all."" In the thirty-first verse of the thirteenth |
chapter, also He declares, ""The Supreme Self dwelling in the . _
body, does not act.""
Here a doubt arises, that it is true that the self does not -
perform actions, but it can inspire others to perform actions.
The clarification is, that as with the rise of the sun, people are
engaged in different activities, such as farming, study and business
etc., even though the sun does not cause them to perform, either
prescribed or prohibited actions. Had the sun, itself caused them —
to act, then it would have been responsible for their virtues
and sins. Similarly, 'prakrti', derives its existence and power,
from God, but He never causes it, to act. This fact, has been
described by the Lord by the expression 'Na karyan', so does
nature, having received power from God or Self, function, but
the self does not inspire anyone to act.
‘Aste sukham'—All human beings, dwell naturally, in the
self. But they believe that they rest, in the body, senses, mind,
intellect and life-breath. So they cannot realize the reality, that
they rest in the Self. But a Sankhyayog!, realizes that he rests in
"
671,"634 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 5
the self, which is perfect and uniform, and this belief involves
no labour..So, here the word 'Aste’ (rests) has been used, while
- in the twenty-fourth verse of the fourteenth chapter, the term
_ “Svasthah' (dwells or rests in the self) has been, used. | - |
| The self, is the origin of all origins and it needs, no base.
This state of ‘resting in the self’, has also been conveyed, in
the twentieth verse, by the expression, ""Such a knower of God,
rests in God.""
Appendix—‘Naiva kurvanna karayan’—-The idea to do an
- action is an obstacle to Self-realization. The feeling of performing
an action causes the sense of doership and the sense of doership
leads. to individuality. Performance of action is in Prakrti, in
_ the self there is actionlessness. Therefore performance of action
connects us with Prakrti and by non-performance of action we _
get established in the self. ‘I have to do nothing’—this notion
is also within the area of the performance of action. Therefore -
a striver should have nothing to do with the performance of an -
action or its non-performance—‘naiva tasya krtenartho nakrteneha
_ kagcana’ (Gita 3/18). The self is free from performance of an _
action or its non-performance viz., it is a transcendental entity.
‘Vasi’—By attachment to the modes of Prakrti a man becomes
_ “avaga’ viz., helpless (Gita 3/5). This helplessness is wiped out
by Jnanayoga and the man becomes ‘vasi’ viz., his life becomes
independent and transcendental.

: Neither the sense of doership nor the nature of actions
does the Lord determine for the mankind, nor does He link
actions with their fruits. But it is the personal nature alone,
that impacts. 14 ,
Comment:—
‘Na kartrtvam na karmani lokasya srjati prabhuh'—The term
""Prabhuh’, has been used here, because the universe is created |
by the Lord, Who is endowed with attributes. He is omnipotent
and He controls, the entire universe. Though, He conducts the
activities of the entire universe, yet He remains, a non-doer
(Gita 4/13). -
All actions, are performed by the modes of nature, but out —
of ignorance, a man identifies himself with nature and becomes ;
a doer of actions, which are done by nature in fact (Gita 3/27). -
God has not made man the doer. If He had made him the doer,
the Lord, in the eighth verse of this chapter, would not have _
said—-The man, who is united with the Divine, and knows the
truth thinks, ""I do nothing at all."" It means, that this sense of
doership is self-made, and so it can be renounced by the man,
who has inculcated it.
The Lord, does not decree whether a person, will have
to perform a particular virtuous or evil deed. Had it been so
decreed by Him, the prescribed and prohibited actions mentioned
by scriptures, preceptors etc., would have been of no avail, and
a man would not have had to bear, the fruit of his actions. The
expression 'Na karmani’, proves that a man is independent, in
the performance of actions.
‘Na karmaphalasarhnyogam'—A man, has to reap the fruit
of actions, which he performs. Actions, being insentient cannot
decide upon their result. So, it is ordained by God (Gita 7/22).
The Lord, awards the fruit of actions, but He does not bring
"
673,"636 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 5
about union with fruit of actions. It is the man, who brings
about this union. He,. out of ignorance, having become a doer
and having been attached to fruit of actions, has to feel happy, -— --~~.--~-
and sad. If he himself, does not get attached to fruit of actions,
he can be free, from it. The term ""Sannydsinam' (renouncers),
in the twelfth verse of the eighteenth chapter, has been used, for

_ such persons who are not attached to the fruit of actions. They
have not to reap the fruits of their actions, here or hereafter. If
God had connected actions with their fruit, a man would have,
never been liberated, from the fruit of actions.

In the, forty-seventh verse of the second chapter, the Lord
declares, ""Let the fruit of action, not be thy motive."" It means,
that it depends upon a man, whether he feels happy or sad and
whether the fruit of action is his motive or not? If the Lord -
had ordained the fruit of action then a man would have never —
become even-minded in pleasure and pain, and he would have ~
never performed actions having abandoned attachment, or the —
fruit of actions, which has been emphasized by the Lord, time
and again in the Gita (vide 4/20, 5/12, 14/24 etc.). -

Question:—In the scriptures, it is mentioned that the Lord

~ Causes those, whom He wants to send to the higher worlds, to
perform virtuous actions, while He causes those whom He wants
to send to the lower worlds, to perform, evil actions. Thus the
declaration, ""Neither agency nor actions does the Lord create
nor does, He connect actions, with their fruits,"" seems contrary
to the ordinance of the scriptures.

Answer:—In fact, the scriptures do not.mean, that the Lord
sends them to the higher or lower worlds, by causing them to
perform virtuous or evil actions, but these mean, that the Lord
purifies them by enabling them to reap the fruit of their past actions
by creating circumstances* so that, they may attain God or His love.

* Being overpowered by desire a man performs good (virtuous) and bad
(evil), actions (Gita 3/37) which lead him to the higher worlds (heaven etc.,)
"
674,"Verse 14] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 637

If the scriptures are interpreted, in the way, that the Lord causes
people to perform virtuous or evil actions, so that they may go
to higher or lower worlds, then man, will become dependent, in Se
performing actions. Prescription and prohibition by the scriptures
and saints, and instruction of the preceptors, will prove to be
futile. So this interpretation, does not seem to be justified.

'Svabhavastu pravartate'—It is, because of his nature, that
man becomes a doer, performs actions and connects actions,
with their fruit. Man himself, is responsible, to form this nature.

So long as, there are attachment and aversion in nature, it is
not purified; and as long as nature, is not purified, a man is
overpowered, by nature.

The Lord, mentions here the same fact, which he has already
stated in the thirty-third verse of the third chapter, when He -
declared, ""Beings follow their nature.""

So long as, a man acts according to his nature, he will -
become. a doer, will perform actions and will link actions, ‘with -
their fruit. Thus, he will remain dependent, and this dependence
is self-created. If man renounces doership, actions and association _
of actions, with fruit which he has made himself, he can realize
that he is ever untainted (uncontaminated).

Appendix—The sense of doership, action and attachment to
the fruit of action—it is not God’s creation, but it is the man’s
(embodied soul’s) own creation. Therefore the man is responsible
for its renunciation also.

‘Svabhavastu pravartate’—In fact renunciation of affinity for
the world is natural; but because of the perception of naturalness
in unnaturalness, affinity for the world is seen natural. This
individual nature is not natural and untainted but it is one’s
own creation.

Comment:—
'Nadatte kasyacitpapam na caiva sukrtam vibhuh’'—The Lord, -
Who has been termed ‘Prabhuh’, in the preceding verse, has been ;
called 'Vibhuh', here. | 7
| A man, can reap the fruit of action in two ways, by performing
actions himself, or by causing others to perform actions. But, _
the Lord neither performs actions, nor does He cause others to
perform these. So, He has not to reap their fruit.
The sun, provides light to the entire universe and men commit
sins and also perform virtuous actions, but the sun has nothing
to do, with those sinful or virtuous actions. Similarly, nature
and the entire universe, receive power from God and with that
power people perform virtuous and sinful actions. But, those
actions performed by the people, have not the least connection,
with God. The Lord, has given freedom to man, whether he
connects actions with their fruits, or offers actions and their
fruit, to God. He who, by misusing the freedom given by the
Lord, becomes a doer and reaps the fruits of actions, is bound.
The Lord, does not accept these actions and their fruit as His.
But he, who by making right use of freedom, offers his actions
"
676,"Verse 15] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 639
and their fruit to God, is liberated, and the Lord accepts such
actions, and their fruits. : |
As, in the twenty-fifth verse of the seventh chapter, by the ~
term 'sarvasya’ (all), and, in the twenty-sixth verse of the same
chapter, by the term 'KaScana’ (anyone), the Lord has talked
about common people, so has He described by the term ‘Kasyacit'
common people, who regard themselves, as doers and enjoyers
of fruits, rather than about devotees. As far as, devotees are
concerned, the Lord accepts a leaf, a flower, a fruit or a little
water, which is offered to Him, with devotion (Gita 9/26-27).
'Ajanenavrtam jnanam'—The knowledge of the self, is
self-evident to all the people, but this knowledge is enveloped
in ignorance. It is because of this ignorance that beings are
deluded. He, who thinks 'T am the doer’, is deluded (Gita 3/27). -
A man, can wipe out this delusion by discrimination, which
has been bestowed upon him by God. Therefore, in the eighth .
verse of this chapter, it has been said, that a Sankhyayogi should -
ever think, ""I do nothing at all"", while, in the thirteenth verse
it has been said, that he should mentally renounce, all actions ~
by discrimination. 7
All objects, such as a body etc., are constantly undergoing
change, while the self, never experiences any change. When a
man identifies the self, with kaleidoscopic objects, it means,
that he is swayed by ignorance. But, when he realizes that the
self is different, from the kaleidoscopic worldly materials, his
ignorance is wiped out and the knowledge of the self, 1s illumined
automatically. The reason is, that knowledge of the self is veiled,
when one assumes affinity with the evolutes of Nature.
The term 'Ajnana’, does not mean total absence of knowledge,
but it means imperfect knowledge, as there cannot be, total
absence of knowledge. Knowledge of the senses and intellect,
is also imperfect. When a person, attaches importance to this
imperfect knowledge, and is influenced by it, he does not keep
"
677,"— 640 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
an eye on real knowledge—this is known as ‘enveloping of the
knowledge, by ignorance’.
The knowledge of intellect, is more extensive, than that of _
- senses, or that of the mind. The knowledge of intellect; illumines,
the knowledge of the mind and senses, but it cannot illumine
nature, whose evolute it is. When it cannot even illumine Nature,
how can it illumine the sentient, which transcends Nature? Thus,
° the knowledge of intellect, is imperfect. |
: 'Tena muhyanti jantayah.'.—The Lord, by using the term
‘Jantavah'’, has condemned human beings, by saying that those
persons, who do not attach importance to discrimination, are
in fact, animals, because without discrimination there is no
difference, between the two.* A-human being, is a human being
not merely by virtue of human form, but because of his sense of _
discrimination. As far as sensual pleasures are concerned, even
animals enjoy these. But, the aim of human life, is not to hanker -
after them instead, it is to realize, the self or God, Who is free -
from pleasure or pain. Those who know, what ought to be done
and what ought not to be done, deserve to be called strivers. _
He, who believes that he is a doer, and who having the
motive of fruit of action, feels happy or sad—such a man, is said.
to be, deluded out of ignorance.. We are forced to do virtuous
and evil actions. How can we get rid of them? To be happy and
to be sad, is the fruit of our actions. How can we rise above
these? To have such conviction, is delusion.
: Man, (self) is a non-doer, and is also, free from pleasures
and pain. It is out of ignorance, that he becomes a doer and feels
happy or sad, by bringing about union with fruit of actions. The
term ‘tena’, stands for this delusion (ignorance). The ignorant,
out. of delusion feel happy and sad. The same fact, has been
* Food, sleep, fear and sex are common between men and animals. Men
are superior to animals because of their sense of discrimination. Without
discrimination they are just like animals (Canakyaniti 17/17).
"
678,"Verse 15] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 641
pointed out, by the expression ‘tena muhyanti jantavah' (by that,
beings are deluded). .
_ Appendix—As the dark has no power to cover the sun, so a -

has ignorance no power to cover knowledge. The unnatural has
been assumed as natural—this is ignorance by which a man
is deluded. Therefore this is merely a notion, not a fact that
knowledge is covered by ‘ignorance. If a man so desires, then
by attaching importarice to his discrimination, he can destroy
this delusion (ignorance) (Gita 5/16).

In fact knowledge is not covered but intellect is covered. But
to a man, knowledge appears to be covered; therefore here the
term ‘avrta’ has been used. The same fact has been mentioned
in the thirty-ninth verse of the third chapter by the expression
‘Avrtamn jiianametena’ (Gita 3/39). Ignorance is non-existent or -
a negation. It has no existence. A non-existent thing cannot veil
the knowledge. Therefore opposite knowledge viz., perception |
of naturalness in unnaturalness is ignorance*. If the vision of -
unnaturalness is discarded, naturalness automatically reveals
itself, then a man will realize his identity with omnipresent -
God. It is because of individuality that sins and virtues attach
to us; therefore having realized identity with the omnipresent
God viz., by the destruction of individuality, sins and virtues
no more attach to us.

Because of ignorance viz., opposite knowledge (natural intellect
in the unnatural) a man becomes ‘jantu’ (animal)—‘tena muhyanti
jantavah.’ Similarly the embodied soul because of its affinity for
matter (non-self) becomes ‘Jagat’ (world) (matter) (Gita 7/13).

We have regarded the Lord Who is ever identified with us
(the self) as separate and we have assumed the body which is
different from us as identified with us—this is ignorance.

the sun. 16 :
Comment:— -
‘Jiianena tu tadajiianam yesam nasitamatmanah'—The term .
'Tu' (but), has been used to show that, in this verse there is _
description of something different, from the preceding verse.
Whatever, was called 'Ajfidnena' in the preceding verse, has _
been called here ‘tat ajiianam' (that ignorance).
Ignorance, consists in identifying the self with the body,
while knowledge comprises in regarding these as two separate
entities.
If we have an egoistic notion and a sense of mine with the
body and the world—this is ignorance. The self, ever remains
the same, while a sense of 'T and the sense of ‘mine’, change.
In the past, we were children and toys were very dear to us,
but now we are young or old and regard, our wives, sons and
riches etc., as ours. Thus, we see that the sense of 'T', and of
‘mine’, are undergoing change while the self, ever remains the
same. That is knowledge, or discrimination.
The perception of the eternal in the transitory, of the pure in the impure, of
pleasure in pain and of the self in the non-self is ignorance.
"
680,"Verse 16] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 643
Thus a striver should realize this reality through discrimination,
and renounce the sense of ‘I’ and that of 'mine’. This is called !
destruction of ignorance, by knowledge. A person, identifies the _
uniform self, with the kaleidoscopic world etc., because, he does |
not attach importance to discrimination. A striver, who having |
aroused this discrimination, renounces the sense of 'T' and that of |
‘mine’ with the perishable world, his discrimination lights up the
supreme Self, 1.e., he realizes God, who is Truth-Consciousness- :
Bliss consolidated. ) ,
'Tesamadityavajjianam. prakaSayati tatparam'-—-When
discrimination is fully aroused, a striver has no affinity, at all
for the kaleidoscopic world. Then he realizes the self, and then
the Supreme-Self is illumined i.e., the Self realizes Its identity
with the Supreme-Self. | |
The word ‘param’, here as well as, in the fifty-ninth verse of the
second chapter and the thirty-fourth verse of the thirteenth chapter, _
has been used for the Supreme (Supreme-Self or God). -
The term 'prakaSayati’, signifies that, as in the dark, objects are
not seen, but these are noticed when the sun rises, so is the Supreme- 7
Self, Who is ever-attained is not realized because of ignorance.
As soon as ignorance is destroyed, the Supreme-Self, is realized.
Appendix—lIgnorance is destroyed only by discrimination,
not by effort—‘yatanto’ pyakrtatmano nainarh paSyantyacetasah’
(Gita 15/11). The reason is that destruction of ignorance is not
possible by the performance of action and by doing labour. By
doing labour, affinity for the body persists because without having.
connection with the body, no labour is done. Secondly by making
effort to wipe out ignorance, ignorance is strengthened, because an
effort is made to wipe it out only when we accept its existence.
The opposite notion (ignorance) of naturalness in unnaturalness
is self-made. By attaching importance to discrimination that
ignorance is removed.

Comment:— |
[God can be realized by two means—first, He (the reality)
can be realized by renouncing the unreal through discrimination, —
and secondly, by thirst for the real. The unreal can be attained
through actions, rather than through thirst. How God can be
realized through thirst, is explained in this verse.] -
'Tadbuddhayah'—A striver, through intellect should have
a conviction, that the Lord pervades everywhere. He existed -
before the world was created, exists now and will also exist if
the world is being destroyed. This is known as absorbing of the
intellect in Him.
'Tadatmanah'—Here the term ‘Atma’, stands, for the mind.
When a striver resolves, that only the Lord pervades everywhere,
his mind automatically thinks of Him only.
'Tannisthah'—When the mind and the intellect of a striver,
are absorbed in God, he realizes that he is naturally established
in Him. But, so long as, the mind and the intellect do not get
absorbed in God i.e., a striver, does not think and resolve, of
His all-pervasive nature, he cannot realize, that he is naturally
established, in Him.
'Tatparayanah'—Such strivers, instead of having a separate
"
682,"Verse 17] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 645
entity, become one with God. Their identity is merged in God,
and thus they become an embodiment of God.
_ Unless the striver, and the spiritual practice become one, BS
the discipline is not continuous. But, when the striver loses his
egoistic notions, his means merges in the end, because both of
these are identical.
‘Jnananirdhitakalmasah'—Through discrimination (wisdom
or knowledge), between the real and the unreal, a striver gets rid
of the unreal. It is because of his affinity for the unreal, that he
commits sins, and is bound. When his affinity for the unreal is
totally renounced, his sins and virtues, are totally wiped out.
'Gacchantyapunaravrttim'—Attachment to the unreal, is the
cause of rebirth. The Lord declares, ""Attachment to the modes, is
the cause of soul's birth, in good and evil wombs"" (Gita 13/21). -
When our attachment for the unreal is wiped out, there is no
question of our return, to the mortal world. |
A thing, which is finite, moves from one place to another,
but one, which is all-pervasive, wherefrom is it to come and
whither is it to go. God pervades all space, time, objects, -
circumstances, equally. He never moves, and so is the case with
great souls, as they have identified themselves with Him. They
also do not move. The scriptures declare— A God-realized soul,
here and now, merges in God. His vital force, does not migrate
(Brhadaranyaka 4/4/6).
Regarding his so-called body, it is said that he is not reborn.
In fact, the term 'Gacchantt' (go) stands for acquiring the knowledge
of the self, which immediately leads to realization of God who
is ever-realized.
Appendix—When the notion of naturalness in unnaturalness
is wiped out, then no other independent existence besides God
persists and a striver becomes the embodiment of God which
is really axiomatic. Therefore there is no question of his return

Suni caiva Svapake ca panditah samadarSinah
Sages equate a learned and humble brahmana, a cow, an |
elephant or even a dog, or a lowly (outcaste), as these have a
vision of God, in all of them. 18
Comment:— -
""Vidyavinayasampanne brahmane gavi hastini Suni caiva Svapake
| ca panditah samadarsinah'—Here, two adjectives ‘learned’ and _
‘humble’, have been used for Brahmana, in order to show his
perfection, as generally a learned person is not humble, and he
becomes proud of his learning. 7
Dealings of a sage with a learned brahmana, a pariah, a
cow, an elephant and a dog would be different. Equal dealings
are neither proper nor possible. The scriptures also support this
view. A learned and humble brahmana, rather than a pariah is
adored, milk is drunk of a cow, rather than of a bitch, while
an elephant rather than a dog can be used for riding. When the
Lord says, that sages see them with an equal eye, He means to
say, that they behold the Lord, pervading everywhere. Therefore,
they do not see with an unequal eye.
Here, a doubt may arise, how can their dealings be different,
if they have an equal eye? The explanation is, that we see all
the parts of our body (forehead, feet, hands and anus etc.,) with
an equal eye and think of their welfare, yet our dealings with
"
684,"Verse 18] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 647
these are different. When anyone is touched with our feet we
feel sorry and beg his pardon, but we do not do so if he is
touched with our arm. We show reverence for others, by bowing _ -
our head and folding hands, rather than feet. A hand has to be
washed, if it touches anus, but it is not washed, if it touches a
hand. Showing the forefinger and the thumb to someone, have
different meanings, which are well-known to all. In this way, a
man has different dealings with different parts of the body, but
he loves them equally. He, is not indifferent to any afflicted limb.
He, through the likeness of the self, sees equality everywhere,
be it pleasure or pain (Gita 6/32). In this way, the wise also
have different dealings with different beings according to the
difference in their food, qualities, conduct and caste etc., and it
is proper also. They behold the Lord, pervading everywhere and
so they love all beings and think of their welfare equally, without -
having any evil propensities, such as attachment, aversion, pride
and partiality etc. They have an automatic inclination, to remove _
the sufferings of other beings and to console and comfort them,
in the same way as a person tries to remove the pain of any
limb of his body. So, it is said that they see everyone, with an -
equal eye. The Lord, has mentioned of this equality of vision or
even-mindedness, several times in the Gita as ""He, who is equal-
minded, excels"" (6/9); ""He sees the same, everywhere"" (6/29);
“He, through the likeness of the self, sees equality everywhere""
(6/32); “Even-minded everywhere"" (12/4); ""He, who sees the
supreme Lord abiding equally in all beings, never perishing when
they perish, verily sees"" (13/27); and ""He sees the same Lord
equally dwelling everywhere” (13/28). |

Sti Sankaracarya declares:—

A man should be non-dual in feelings, rather than in dealings
(TattvopadeSa).

Now-a-days, people talk a lot, about equanimity. But it must
"
685,"648 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
be understood in the right perspective... .

Equanimity, is not child's play but an embodiment of God.
The Lord declares, ""Those, whose minds get rooted in equanimity, -
overcome the world (birth and death) and realize the Absolute _
(God)"" (Gita 5/19). This state of equanimity, is attained when
others’ pleasure and pain, become a striver's own pleasure and -
pain. The Lord declares, ""O Arjuna, he who through the likeness
of the self, sees equality (equanimity) everywhere, be it pleasure

Or pain, is considered a perfect Yogi"" (Gita 6/32). -

A striver, attains equanimity when he is engaged in removing
the suffering of others, in the same way, as he gets engaged
promptly in removing his own suffering. Explaining the marks
of a saint, Tulasidasa declares—

‘Saints feel happy and sad in the happiness and sadness, of -
others’ (Manasa 7/38/1). |

So long as, a man desires pleasure, he cannot attain equanimity,
in spite of his best efforts. But, when he has a keen desire to-
provide comfort to others, to do good to them, and he thinks
of their salvation, he becomes equanimous. A striver, should -
begin such activity, with his family. He should try his best to
remove the suffering of his parents, wife, sons and other near
and dear ones, even if he has himself to suffer. By doing so,
he will attain peace. Similarly, he should try to remove the
suffering of others. By doing so he will be thrilled with joy.
We should serve, those to whom we are not attached or we
should renounce our attachment for those, whom we serve—the
result will be the same. |

Saint Tulasidasa in the Manasa declares, ""Laksmana serves
Lord Rama and Sita with the same zeal, as that with which, an
ignorant man serves his body"" (2/142/1). |

It is not wise to serve one’s own body, because even an
animal does so. A mother-monkey, loves its youngone so much,
that it does not leave the youngone, even when the latter dies.
"
686,"Verse 18] -SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 649

But, when someone gives it any eatable, it eats itself, without

giving it to its youngone. Even if the youngone tries to eat, the

mother scares the youngone away, as long as attachment is there, —.

equanimity is out of the question. | -
We should serve others, in a disinterested manner. If anyone

goes astray, we should guide. him in a pleasant way to follow

the right path. By doing so, we shall feel peace and happiness.

If we do not guide him, we cannot experience peace. Let any

one try this and see. Similarly, if we invite a thirsty person to

_ have a drink of cold water, it gives us satisfaction, and peace |

of mind. This.kind of happiness or. peace leads us, to salvation

while the desire to seek pleasure, leads us to degradation. In the

same way, when religious discourses are arranged, we should

politely request people to take comfortable seats, so that they may ,

listen to the discourse properly, instead of commanding them, in — -

an authoritative tone. By doing so, we. shall derive satisfaction

and peace. But, if we command them in an authoritative tone, . _

it will reveal our pride which will prick others and we shall |

not be able to attain peace. By such behaviour, we can never

attain equanimity. |
Those, who are engrossed in the welfare of all beings attain .

the Lord (Gita 12/4) because He is a disinterested frend, of all

beings (Gita 5/29). It is He, Who rears all beings, whether they _

- are believers or non-believers. Water quenches the thirst, of both __

the staunch believer and non-believer, the sun, provides light to

both, air helps everyone to breathe, and the earth provides room

to everyone, without any distinction, whether they believe in

God or not. Thus, everybody has an equal share in the things,

created by God. _
Equanimity or equality, does.not mean that food should .

be eaten and marriages should be arranged without taking

into consideration caste, creed or colour etc. Equality, in such

_ dealings leads to degradation. It is, the god of death who has
"
687,"650 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
equal dealings with all, because all the beings whether they are
saints or householders, animals or gods, have to die. .

Animals also have equality of dealings. A dog enters a

brahmana's kitchen with unclean feet, in the same way as it - -
enters the kitchen of a sweeper, because it does not distinguish
between a brahmana and a sweeper. But the same behaviour
on the part of a man cannot be ignored. Equanimity, consists
in removing the suffering of others and in doing good to them.
This equanimity, purifies him and his heart. But if one does not
observe purity in food etc., his heart gets impure which leads
to disquietude. Superficial equality, is against the ordinance of
the scriptures and the decorum of society, and it causes conflict
in society.

The scriptures do not support the view that the brahmanas _ |
(priest class) are high by caste, while the Siidras (labour class)
are low. The brahmanas through preaching, the ksatriyas (the
watrior class) through protection (heroism), the vaisyas (the -
trading class) through trade, and the sidras (the labour class) |
through physical labour, should serve the members of all castes. -
But, it does not mean, that members of other castes should not do
physical labour, while performing their duty. All of them should
labour equally during the performance of their duty. Everyone
should render service to others and co-operate with them with
all the resources he possesses. |

In the past, people followed the varna (caste) system and

asrama (order of life) system and led a happy and peaceful life.
But today the Varnasrama system is being replaced by factions
and groups. In villages people cannot even get water because
the owners of the wells do not allow those people, who support
the candidates of the rival parties, to draw water from their
wells. Among the members of the same family also, there are
feuds because they support different parties. How miserable is
the condition! | | |
"
688,"Verse 19] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 651

If we want to attain equanimity, we should try to remove
the sufferings of others whether they belong to our caste, order
of life, religion or sect etc., or not, and should also do good to a
them. They may be, the devotees of Lord Rama or Lord Krsna or
Lord Siva or they may be muslims or christians etc., we should
equally think of their welfare. We should never be partial to the
people of our own caste or creed or group etc., nor should we
feel happy and sad, when our own group or creed gain victory
or suffer defeat over a rival group or creed etc. We should help
them and satisfy their needs, to the best of our capacity and
‘resources, without having feelings of envy, jealousy, hatred and
pride etc., as upliftment is possible through righteous feelings,
virtues and good conduct. Moreover, we should have the feelings
that all beings should be happy, and free from disease and none
should ever suffer, in the least. Having such feelings, we should -
do good to others—that is equanimity.

Appendix—-A Brahmana, a pariah, a cow, an elephant and a _
dog—{the bodies of) all these are changing every moment and
are going into non-existence but the reality ever abiding in them -
never changes, it ever remains the same. The wise perceive that
reality only. As an ant extracts grains of sugar mixed with sand,
in the same way the discerning eye of the wise perceives the real
entity pervading the unreal world. It means that whether there
is a Brahmana or a pariah, a cow or a dog, an elephant or an
ant; in all these heterogeneous beings, the wise have an equal
eye. In spite of inequality in their dealings, they have never an
inequal eye.

Even here, the whole world is conquered by those whose minds _ Oo
are vested in equanimity. As God is flawless and equal, therefore,
they become merged in God (Brahman). 19
Comment:—

'Yesam samye sthitam manah'—When a person realizes,
that he is established in God or Self, and when he renounces
attachment, aversion, desire and unevenness of mind etc., his
mind and intellect, naturally get established in equanimity.
Though outwardly there is no obvious difference between
the dealings of a great soul and a common man, yet inwardly
there is a lot of difference. The mind of a great soul remains
equanimous, flawless and quiet, while that of a common man,
uneven, defective and disquiet. -

In the morning, when the sun rises, it is not seen in the |
east if it is hidden behind high mountains, in that direction, -
but its light can be seen, on the top of a high mountain in the
west. It shows, that the sun has risen, even if it is not visible, -
in the east. Similarly, those, whose minds and intellects remain
untainted by honour and dishonour, praise and blame, pleasure
and pain, etc., and are free from attachment, aversion, joy and
sorrow, are naturally established, in the self. The reason is, that
for a person without being established in the self, it is impossible
to maintain evenness of mind and intellect.

‘Thaiva tairjitah sargah'—Here the plural has been used in
the term 'taih’, (by those) by the Lord, to explain that all men
can realize God and can conquer the entire world.

The expression ‘Tha eva’, means that even here, during a
lifetime, in this world, they can conquer the world 1.e., can be
liberated from this world.

The body, senses, mind, intellect, beings, objects, incidents
and circumstances etc., are all different from the self. He, who
"
690,"Verse 19] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 653
depends on them, is dependent. He, who attaches importance
to them, and desires them, remains dependent 1.e., is defeated. :
But when he renounces attachment to them, and sincerely gives - .
up desire for them, it means that he has overcome, them. Till,
slavery to desire persists, he is a vanquished, one.
Only, a defeated person wants to win over and subdue others.
In fact no one can defeat others, without subduing himself. For
example, if a king or a scholar, wants to defeat others, he will
have to resort to his army, capability, learning, wisdom etc.
A man, becomes dependent as soon as his desire is born.
This dependence remains, whether desire is satisfied or not. When
the desire is not satisfied, a person remains dependent for want
of the object of his desire. But, when that desire is satisfied,
he depends upon the object, he has acquired, though he does - |
not realize, this dependence because his intellect 1s veiled by
ignorance. He, feels himself to be independent. |
A wise man, becomes totally independent, because he has -
no desire at all, and such a man is victorious, though he has
no desire to overcome, others. He needs nothing, in the world, _
while the world needs him.
Such an equanimous great soul, who has overcome the world,
is not tempted by much mundane pleasure and is not shaken, even
by the heaviest sorrow (Gita 6/22). He has not the least desire for
any beings, objects and circumstances etc. Though he knows of
desirable and undesirable circumstances, and makes effort to be free
from the undesirable ones, yet they have no effect on his mind.
'Nirdosam hi samarh brahma'—All flaws and heterogeneity,
are found in a man, because, of his affinity for nature. But,
God is flawless, equanimous and unattached because, He has
no affinity for nature. |
""Tasmadbrahmani te sthitah'—God, is flawless and equanimous.
Therefore, great souls, whose minds are flawless and equanimous,
are established in God. a
"
691,"654 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
When a man is attached, to the kaleidoscopic and unreal
world, all flaws and heterogeneity are born. As great souls, do
not attach any importance to the unreal, they remain flawless and
equal and so they remain established in God. As, where there is
smoke there must be a fire, because without fire, smoke is not
possible; so are those, whose minds are established in equality,
established in God, because without being established in God,
full equanimity (equality) is not possible. |

When a man himself gets established in God, his mind is
also established in equanimity. It is only when, they have attained
the state of equanimity, that great souls are said to have attained,
God-realization or equanimity. This equanimity, has been called

_ Yoga in the Gita (2/48). According to the Gita, this attainment
of equanimity, is regarded as perfection of human life. __

The topic of Jianayoga (the Discipline of Knowledge), was
started in the thirteenth verse. The term ‘Jantavah' (beings or
animals), used in the plural number in the fifteenth verse, continued -
upto this nineteenth verse. The Lord, by using the plural number,
means to explain that all those people who are deluded, can attain _
God-realization. But, in the present verse the term, 'Brahmani'
has been used. in the singular, which indicates that all people
attain the same God. Every person, whether he is a brahmana
(member of the priest class) or a pariah, attains the same Lord,
Who was attained by great sages such as Sanaka etc.

Appendix—Here the term ‘mana’ should be interpreted as
intellect because it is not the mind which gets established in
equanimity but it is intellect which gets established. Mind is
concentrated in meditation. This is the topic of steadfast intellect.
Steadfastness of the mind persists only in meditation, not while
engaged in dealings but steadfastness of intellect persists constantly.

It is not the steadfastness of mind but the steadfastness of intellect
which leads to salvation. Steadfastness of mind brings about
‘Siddhis’ (mysterious accomplishments). Therefore steadfastness
"
692,"Verse 20] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 655
of the mind is not of so much value as is the steadfastness of
intellect. The Lord in the second chapter also has glorified a man
of steadfast wisdom (intellect). In the next verse also the Lord
has mentioned that an undeluded person with a firm intellect 7 -
becomes one with Brahma (God)—‘sthirabuddhirasammidho
brahmavid brahmani sthitah’. :
By error a striver may not think himself to be an enlightened
soul, therefore this mark has been mentioned that if there is no
equanimity. in intellect, one should understand that he has not
attained Self-realization, this is merely his misconception. The
mark of equanimity in intellect is—freedom from attachment
and aversion, pleasure and pain etc. Having realized the self,
equanimity ever persists in intellect. Intellect never deviates or
stirs from this equanimity. |
Those, whose intellect is established in equanimity, become -
free from attachment and aversion. Their equanimous intellect |
naturally remains firm in the fact that all is God. When there _
is no other entity besides God then who should have aversion
and towards whom? When.only that one ever-existent entity is
realized, then no desire persists, and no disquietude remains. -

_. ""Na prahrsyetpriyam prapya nodvijetprapya capriyam'—To get —
agreeable beings, objects, incidents and circumstances, appealing _
to the body, senses, mind, principles, caste, creed and scriptures,
is called acquisition of 'priya’ (agreeable) and what is contrary
to it. 1s ‘apriya' (disagreeable). When, a striver obtains pleasant
(desirable) beings, objects, and circumstances etc., according to
his desire, he should not feel happy. Similarly, when he meets.

| with unpleasant ones, he should. not be sad. He knows the
desirable and the undesirable ones, but he is neither attached

to the desirable nor has an aversion for, the undesirable. Mere
knowledge of. the agreeable and disagreeable, is not a flaw, if
one remains free from joy or grief. |

: The mind, knows the desirable (pleasant) and the undesirable
(unpleasant), while the doer becomes happy and sad. Though all
actions, are performed by the modes of nature, yet he whose
mind is deluded, by egoism thinks, ""I am the doer,"" feels happy _
and sad. But, he who knows the true character of the self (soul)
and the modes of nature, understands, that it is the modes, which -
are acting on the modes (Gita 3/28), So he knows, that he is
not the doer and thus there is no question for him (the self) to
be happy or sad.

‘Sthirabuddhih'—The self, can be known by the self, without
the help of the instruments, such as the body, senses, mind and
intellect etc. The knowledge, which is acquired with mind
and intellect etc., is imperfect, as it is neither permanent nor
certain (doubtless). But, the knowledge of the self by the self is
permanent, uniform and certain. A great soul, who has realized

_this knowledge of the self, by the self has such a balanced and
firm mind, that there remains, neither any doubt nor option nor

contrary feelings in it. So, he is called 'sthira-buddhih' (one with
firm intellect or understanding). a
_ ‘Asammiidhah'—Commonly, deluded people, do not behold

the omnipresent Lord, ever-pervading everywhere, they believe .
that the world (which is really transitory and unreal), is real.
But, the undeluded, are those who are completely free from -
such belief.
'‘Brahmavit'—God, cannot be realized by a person, who does |
not identify himself with Him. But, when he identifies himself
with Him, without having any separate entity, he realizes Him.
In God-realization, the liberated soul, the means and God, all ,
the three, become one. There remains no trio, only realization
is left. In fact, who has realized God—this cannot be explained.
The reason is, that such a liberated soul, becomes one with God
(Brahma), and he has not the least pride of his achievement, that
he has realized God.
""Brahmani sthitah'—In fact, all beings are essentially and 7
constantly established in Brahma (God), but by an error they
assume that they are established in body, senses, mind and intellect |
etc. So they cannot realize the truth, that they are established in -
Him. But a great soul, in all circumstances, realizes that he is
established in Him, naturally and constantly. | -
An object may be established in another object, but
establishment in God, is distinct from it. When a great soul
identifies himself with God, only God remains, he completely loses
his separate entity. So long as, he thinks that he is established
in Him, it means that he has not fully identified himself with
Him, and he still has finiteness. | | :
Appendix—In sound sleep and in a swoon a man’s affinity
for the body is renounced involuntarily viz., due to ignorance
the mind merges in ignorance. Therefore in these states a man
does not feel pleasant and unpleasant and also bodily pain etc.
But a liberated exalted soul renounces his affinity for the body
discriminately. Therefore he knows the pleasant and the unpleasant
and also bodily pain etc., but he does not feel rejoiced and
agitated, happy and sad in them. His dependence on the body,

sa brahmayogayuktatma sukhamaksayamasnute

When a person is no longer attached to external sense-objects,
he finds happiness in the self. Having completely merged himself _
with Brahma (God), he enjoys eternal bliss. 21
Comment:—

""‘Bahyasparsesvasaktatma—He, who, instead of being attached —
to the body, senses, mind, intellect, life-breath etc., as well as, to
objects of senses, such as sound and touch etc., is attached, only = -
to God, is known as, unattached to external contacts. A striver
whose attachment has not been totally wiped out, but whose aim
has been to wipe it out, should also be included among those
strivers, who have renounced attachment, as they quickly get rid
of it because of their firm resolve. |

This detachment is necessary, in order to attain the state
mentioned in the preceding verse, in which a striver neither
rejoices on obtaining, what is pleasant, nor grieves on getting
what is unpleasant. : |

So long as, a man is attached to sense-objects etc., internally
or externally, he cannot realize the self. All these objects are
transitory and constantly undergo change, but because of attachment
to them a man has not an eye on their kaleidoscopic nature and
derives pleasure out of them. But in fact they cannot provide
"
696,"Verse 21] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 659
pleasure; it is renunciation of affinity for them, which provides
pleasures. Therefore, a man feels pleasure in sound sleep when
he forgets his affinity for sense-objects.

A man, has a wrong notion that he cannot live without - |
external contacts, but in fact, he cannot live with constant
external contacts. To forget, all external contacts he sleeps. Thus
he regains freshness, vitality and health, which he can never get,
in the wakeful state. Therefore, he considers sleep very essential.

Energy, is gained through dissociation, with objects.

When a man goes to bed, he means to renounce his affinity
for external objects, as also, to work after waking from sleep. As
he attaches more importance to work, he does not pay attention
to the renunciation of his affinity, for objects. He sleeps and
awakes having affinity for objects.

It is very surprising that if a person who was our relative -
dies, our affinity, for him continues. The reason is, that the |
assumed affinity can be wiped out only, when the person who .
has assumed it, renounces it. As soon as, he renounces it, he
attains salvation, which is natural.

The affinity with external objects is unreal, while our affinity :
with God is real. A man, assumes his affinity with external
objects, in order to derive pleasure out of them. But it results
in sufferings (Gita 5/22). By realizing this fact, attachment to
external objects is destroyed.

""Vindatyatmani yatsukham'—When attachment to the external
objects is wiped out, a striver finds Sattvika happiness. Happiness
derived out of the affinity, for the external objects, is Rajas (of
the mode of passion). A person goes on enjoying this rajasa (of
the mode of passion) happiness, so long as he does not gain
sattvika (of the mode of goodness), happiness. When he ceases
attachment to the rajasa happiness he gains sattvika happiness.

‘Sa brahmayogayuktatma'—As soon as attachment for the
world is lost, a striver identifies himself, with Brahma (God). As
"
697,"660 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
with the disappearance of darkness, light is revealed, so when
attachment to the world is erased, the striver is identified with
Brahma. Both, happen simultaneously. Yet disappearance of
darkness, is prior to ilumination of light—it is deemed so. Similar, —~
is the case with effacement of attachment and establishment in
God. In the first verse of the thirteenth chapter, it is described,
that the knower of the field (the self), is different from the field
(body), while in the second verse it is said, that the self has Its
identity with the Supreme Self. Similarly, in this verse by the
expression 'bahyasparSesvasaktatma’ (with the self unattached to
external contact), it is explained that the self is different from
the body and the world, this expression 'Brahmayogayuktatma,
elucidates the identity of the self with God. |
Having become detached from pleasure and having found
sattvika happiness, a striver may have a subtle egoistic notion, __
by thinking ‘I am happy’, 'I am wise’, 'I am flawless’, I have
no duty to perform' and so on. In order to get rid of this subtle =_
egoistic notion, it is necessary that a striver, should identify
himself with God totally, otherwise he cannot remain totally
free, from the sense of individuality. -
'‘Sukhamaksayamasnute'—So long as, a striver goes on enjoying
sattvika pleasure, he has egoism (attachment), in subtle form.
But, when he ceases to enjoy this sattvika happiness, his egoism
perishes totally and he realizes God, Who is sentient, uniform
and imperishable. This is known, as eternal bliss. This is also
called infinite bliss (6/21; 6/28), absolute bliss (14/27) and so
on. Having attained this eternal bliss, there is natural attraction
for God, and this attraction is known as supreme devotion
(Gita 18/54). This devotion ever-increases i.e., the Lord, seems to
be revealed in new forms, to such a devotee. In this connection,
there is a point which needs attention. If a striver, thinks that
his devotion was imperfect in the past, but now it has attained
perfection, it means that the striver has not attained perfection,
"
698,"Verse 22] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 661
as he is an aspirant still. But, if in spite of perceiving novelty
in the Lord, he feels that his devotion was supreme in the past
also, it means that he has attained perfection. - -

The pleasures that are born of attachment (with objects), are
only sources of pain, these have a beginning and an end, O son of
Kunti (Arjuna), no wise man finds happiness in them. 22 - |
Comment:—
""Ye hi sarhsparsaja bhogah'—Pleasure is derived from the _
contact of senses, with their objects—sound, touch, colour, taste
and smell. A man, also derives pleasure out of honour, praise,
beings, objects, circumstances etc. Man is not free in acquiring |
sense-objects. If somebody, eulogizes the doctrines we respect,
we feel happy—that is also a sort of enjoyment. It means, to
derive pleasure through beings, objects, circumstances and states
by body, senses and mind is known, as 'bhoga' (enjoyment).
Not only the forbidden pleasure, but also those which
are sanctioned by the scriptures, must also be renounced,
because these are obstacles, to God-realization. Pleasure can be
derived, only by having affinity for insentient (matter), while
it is a must to renounce affinity, for the insentient (matter), to
attain God-realization.
'Adyantavantah'—All the pleasures have a beginning and
"
699,"662 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5

an end, these are impermanent, kaleidoscopic (Gita 2/14) and
insentient, while the self is permanent, unchanging and sentient.
The sense-objects never identify with the self, therefore, the self
cannot gain happiness from pleasure. The self, is a fragment of —
God (Gita 15/7), therefore, it can attain eternal bliss from God
(Gita 5/21) alone. . .

As soon as, a person realizes, that these pleasures have a
beginning and an end, are transitory, and fleeting, the effect of
pleasure and pain, is lessened for him. Therefore, the expression
‘adyantavantah’, is a panacea, to root out the effect of pleasure.

""Duhkhayonaya eva te'—All the pleasures born of contacts,
are only sources of pain. Pleasure is born of pain and ends in
pain. A man feels happy having acquired a thing, in the same
proportion as its lacking was causing pain to him, and again
feels sad having lost it. -

| A libertine cannot escape pains or sorrows, because sensual
pleasures can be enjoyed by having affinity for the insentient _
(matter); and this affinity, for the insentient is the cause of great
suffering, in the form of birth and death.

| In the 'Patafijalayogadarsana’, it is stated, ""A wise man does __

not indulge in pleasures, because these result in three kinds
of pains. These pains are called 'parinamaduhkha’ (pain as a.
result), ‘tapaduhkha (affliction) and 'sarnskaraduhkha'. Moreover,
contradictions in the modes of nature, also result in pain.

Sensual pleasures, which appear like nectar at first, are like
poison in the end (Gita 18/38), because in enjoying these, energy
and objects are lost. So the result is pain. This is '‘parinamaduhkha.'

When a person, beholds others enjoying those pleasures which
he cannot enjoy, because he does not possess those objects, or
when he is afraid to lose them or when he is incapable of enjoying
these in spite of his attachment for them, he is filled with grief,
in spite of the fact, that the objects are available to him. This is
‘tapaduhkha’. He remembers the lost pleasures—this is pain, in the
"
700,"Verse 22] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 663
form of latent impressions. This is called 'sarnskaraduhkha’.
A person, wants to enjoy pleasure because of his inclination
to them, but his discrimination checks him from enjoying them. -
Similarly, while listening to divine discourses, because of the |
mode of ignorance, he feels sleepy he wants to derive pleasure,
from sleep. But because of the mode of goodness, he thinks that
he should avail himself of such golden opportunities, which are
very rare. Thus there is a contradiction or say tussel in the modes
of nature and this internal fight is very painful for strivers.
In the enjoyment of pleasure, a person is dependent because
these can be enjoyed according to one's fate, while he is independent
in God-realization, as this human body has been bestowed upon
him, only to attam Him. Pleasure cannot be enjoyed equally,
even by two persons, while God can be realized by everyone, -
even in this Kali-age, as He was realized in the Satya-age, by
great sages. Pleasures cannot be enjoyed forever, by all persons, |
while God can be realized forever, by everybody. It means, that -
there is a difference in acquiring pleasure i.e., all people cannot
acquire these. But, there is no difference, as for as renunciation -
of pleasures is concerned, all can renounce pleasure.
The word ‘eva’ means that pleasure is, doubtlessly and
certainly, a source of pain. There seems to be happiness, in
them but in reality, there is none in the least.
""Na tesu ramate budhah'—-A wise man, unlike a common
man does not delight in pleasure, because he regards these as
sources of pain. He, does not become a slave to them.
A wise man, knows that all the sorrow, suffering, sin and
hell etc., depend, on a desire for pleasure. Therefore, he who
attaches importance, to this knowledge, is wise. He, who knows
that pleasures are sources of pain, yet, desire them and delight in
them, does not deserve to be called, wise as a wise man, neither
desire nor takes delight in them.
Appendix—The pleasure derived from contact with objects,
"
701,"664 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
| _ persons and actions, is the root of sorrows. He, who enjoys
pleasures, has to suffer pain—it is the rule. In fact the hope, the
desire for pleasures and taking enjoyments, don’t provide happiness _
but they provide sadness. The union of pleasures is transient
and their disunion is eternal. A man by attaching importance
to the transient feels sad. He should think whether the. desire
for pleasure will provide pleasure and end his sufferings. The
desire for pleasure neither provides pleasure nor ends sufferings.
The desire for pleasure in order to wipe out pain, is the root
of pain.
One is—‘suffering pain’ and one is—‘effect of the pain’.
When a man suffers pain, then he has a desire for pleasure;
and when he has the effect of pain, then the desire for pleasure
is wiped out and he has a distaste for pleasure. By suffering
pain, a man feels sad and by the effect of pain, he rises above _
pain. Because of the effect of pain, instead of being engrossed
in pain, he thinks of its reason why he has to suffer pain. By _
reflecting upon it, he comes to know that except attachment to —
pleasure, there neither is, nor was, nor will be, nor can be any
other reason. Any circumstances are also not the reason because _
the circumstances do not ‘stay even for a moment. No person
can cause us pain because he destroys our old sins and enables
us to progress further. The world is also not the cause of pain
because whatever change takes place, is not to provide us pain
but it is to enable us to progress. If there is no change, how
will development take place? Without change how will a seed
grow into a tree? How will Ovum-Semen make a body? How >
will a baby become a youth? How will a fool become learned?
How will a patient become healthy? It means that natural change
leads to development. In the world, change is the quintessence of
progress. Without change, the world would have become static
and motionless like picture. Therefore change is not to be blamed
but the desire to derive pleasure from this change is to be blamed.
God is also not the cause of pain because He is the abode of
"
702,"Verse 23] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 665
bliss, in Him there is not even an iota (trace) of pain. |
‘Na tesu ramate budhah’—A wise (discriminating) man
‘does not delight in pleasures because the desire for pleasure -
is the constant enemy of the wise ‘jnanino nityavairina’ (Gita
3/39). An ignorant person likes pleasures because vices appear :
as virtues because of indiscrimination. All pleasures are born of
evils. If there. 1s no blemish in the inner sense, there cannot be :
any pleasure taking. Only a wise person can perceive his flaws. |
Therefore he does not take delight in pleasures viz., does not |
enjoy pleasures. |
A wise (discriminating) man has no desire for the thing which oO
does not stay with him forever. By using his discrimination he
accepts the truth, “Anything, person, ability and power which
acquired, are neither mine nor for me. Not only this but in infinite -
universes, there is not anything which is mine and which is for
me. Even the most loving thing is not mine forever and will not
stay with me forever.” Therefore a wise man determines that he -
can live happily forever without the objects and persons that are |
not likely to stay with him forever. : -

Comment:— |

‘Saknotihaiva yah sodhum prakSariravimoksanat
kamakrodhodbhavarh vegam'—Every being, possesses unusual -
discrimination but it remains latent in birds and beasts etc., who
know only how to maintain their body. In the life of gods etc., this
discrimination remains concealed because these-bodies are for the
enjoyment of pleasures. In human life also, the discrimination of
those, who hanker after pleasure and prosperity, remains veiled,
but time and again, their sense of discrimination, makes them
realise that pleasure and prosperity, result in pain and sin. A
person, remains entangled in them, because he does not attach
importance to discrimination. Therefore, a person by attaching
importance to discrimination, should make it a permanent feature;
and he has no restriction in doing so. By that he can be free from
evil propensities, such as attachment, aversion, desire, anger etc. -
Therefore, by using the term ‘Tha’ (here) in this world the Lord
exhorts human beings to resist the impulses of desire and anger, _
so that they may be happy forever, by controlling them.

This human body, has been bestowed upon us, so that _
having controlled the impulse of desire and anger, we may attain
salvation. Every human being, without any distinction of caste,
colour or creed etc., is qualified and deserving in controlling
these impulses. | |

A man could die at any moment. So he should be ever
cautious, not to be swayed by desire and anger, and he should
control these, here in this life, before giving up the body. Secondly,
it can also be interpreted that before the body starts functioning
under their sway, these should be controlled.

As soon as, the thought of hankering after pleasure comes
to the mind, a striver, should become alert, that he is a striver
and so it is not proper for him to get entangled in pleasure. He
should immediately renounce such thoughts.

It is because of attachment to objects—believing that these
"
704,"Verse 23] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 667

are beautiful and give pleasure, that—such thoughts crop up. Such

thoughts, give rise to desire to acquire them and we get angry

with persons, who create obstacles, in their acquisition. -
As soon as thoughts of desire and anger come to mind, these

should be renounced otherwise, later it becomes very difficult

to control these urges. As soon as, a thought arises, there is

disquietude, excitement and struggle etc., in the mind. So such

a man cannot be happy. But when he resists these impulses, he

becomes happy. Sometimes, a person can control these impulses

out of fear, in the presence of another man who may be more

powerful, than he. Similarly, he can control these out of greed,

in business etc., in order to earn money. But, this control cannot

make him happy, because in such cases, instead of getting

entangled in desire and anger, he gets caught in fear and greed. -

Moreover, a person, who resists impulses of desire and anger, :

has been called a Yogi. But, no one becomes a Yogi, who has

not renounced thoughts (Gita 6/2). Therefore, for a striver it 1s -

better to renounce thought, as soon as, it comes to the mind,

rather than to resist the impulses of desire and anger. -
A striver, can control desire and anger by realizing the fact

that these are not inherent in him, as the self is permanent, while

they are transitory. Secondly, how can these be in him, when he

knows that he is different from them? Thirdly, a person can be

free from desire and anger (Gita 5/26; 16/22) it means that only

he who is 1n reality free from them, can be free. Fourthly, the

Lord has called desire and anger (the gross forms of attachment

and aversion), the modification of nature (Gita 13/6). So they

remain in nature (prakrti), not in the self, as the self does not |

undergo any modification. Thus, desire and anger do not abide

in the self. He who considers them abiding in the self, invites

them to overcome him.
‘Sa yuktah narah'—The Lord, in the fifteenth verse of this

chapter, has called such persons, '‘Jantavah' (animals), whose
"
705,"668 | SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
knowledge is veiled by ignorance. Here, He has called a person,
who controls the impulses of desire and anger, 'narah' (a man).
It means, that only he who has controlled these urges, deserves
to be called, a man, otherwise, he is just like an animal. -

He, who remains established in equanimity, is called a Yogi. —
He, who by attaching importance to discrimination is not swayed by
desire and anger, is established in equanimity (even-mindedness).

‘Sa sukhi'—Not to talk of men, even birds and beasts cannot
lead a happy and peaceful life, if they are swayed by desire and
anger. So, only a man, who has controlled these impulses is happy,
otherwise evils such as disquietude, volatility and struggles are
born and a man cannot be happy. A person, who depends on
perishable persons and objects etc., and who, wants to derives
pleasure, out of them by having affinity for them, can never be _
happy—this is a rule.

Appendix—In the mind first “sphurana’ an idea (a thought |
which flashes on the mind) flashes. If a thought is accompanied -
with the feeling of reality for it, attachment to it and insistence
on it, it is linked to us and it is transformed into a Sankalpa. _

| This Sankalpa gives birth to contemplation which in its turn
gives an impetus to evil propensities such as desire and anger
etc., (Gita 2/62-63). The topmost priority of a striver should be
not to let the impetus (impulse) be born viz., he should not allow
it to develop into a Sankalpa. Secondly if the impetus however
is born, he should not act according to it. :

Link:—Having described the sad plight of a person, who is
swayed by desire and anger, the Lord, in the next verse, explains
the glory of a person, who is happy within himself.

yo'ntahsukho'ntararamastathantarjyotireva yah

sa yogi brahmanirvanam brahmabhito'dhigacchati

One who is happy in God, rejoices in God and is illumined
in God, that Yogi (Sankhyayog!) identified with Brahma, attains
to the beatitude of God (Brahma nirvana). 24
Comment:—

'Yo'ntahsukho'ntararamastathantarjyotireva yah'—'Antah
sukhah’ (one who is happy within himself), is he, who instead
of being happy in possessing the worldly objects, is happy
only in God. Besides God, none is his object of happiness. He
constantly enjoys God.

He, constantly remains happy within himself and so he needs
no outward (external) objects etc. He remains happy within himself,
because the self cannot inflict pain upon the self, and the self, -
cannot have disinclination, for the self.

The outwardly or external objects etc., cannot be acquired,
by everyone forever, while the internal self can be attained by 7
everyone forever. |

'Antararamah'—(One who rejoices within himself), is he who :
instead of rejoicing in external pleasure, rejoices in the self or in
God, during spiritual practice, as well as in practical life.

The Lord, is. the illuminator and base of all the mundane
knowledge of senses and intellect etc., ‘antarjyotih' is a striver
who ever remains illumined.

Mundane knowledge, has a beginning and an end, while 7
the knowledge of God constantly, remains the same without
undergoing any change at all. A Sankhyayog!, naturally possesses
knowledge, that only God pervades everywhere.

‘Sa yogi brahmanirvanam brahmabhito'dhigacchati'—A
striver, following the path of Sankhya (knowledge), realizes
that he is established in Brahma (God), which shows his
egoistic thinking as he believes 'I am liberated’, 'I am established
"
707,"670 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA - [Chapter 5
in Brahma (God).’ So long as this egoistic notion prevails,
| it means, that he is not a God-realized soul i.e., he has: not
attained perfection. So, such a striver should not be satisfied, -
with this state.
The expression 'Brahmanirvanam’, means the attainment of
' Eternal Peace, without the least disquietude. |
_ When a Sankhyayogi, identifies himself with God, only God
remains, he does not retain his separate entity, in the least, he
attains perfection, or God-realization. In ""Brahma bhuta’ state, a
Striver realizes that he 1s identified with Brahma. But, when his
egoistic notion (individuality) perishes, none remains to realize
this identification. He himself becoming Brahma (God), attains
to Brahma (God).
| Appendix—-Here the term ‘antah’ should mean God rather -
than ‘antah karana’ (internal organ). The reason is that he who is
happy within the internal organ, who rejoices within the internal
_ organ and who is tranquilly illumined within the internal organ, 7
can’t attain Brahma (God). Brahma is attained having renounced
affinity for the internal organ. ~

"
708,"Verse 25] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 671
Comment:— a |
_ ""Yatatmanah'—The strivers, whose aim is God-realization,
have not to control their minds, bodies, senses and intellects, .
but they are instinctively and easily controlled. When, they are
controlled, strivers become free from evils, such as attachment and
aversion, and all their activities are for the welfare of others.
So long as, a striver. regards the body, senses, mind and
intellect as his, and for him, these are not controlled by him; and
they have such evils as attachment, aversion, desire and anger
etc. So a striver is controlled by them. Therefore, a striver should
not regard these as his, and for him. By doing so, they come
under his control. Here the expression 'Yatatmanah', has been
used, for those cautious and alert strivers, who do not regard
the body, senses, mind and intellect as theirs, and who consider
these as different from the self. | | -
_ ‘Sarvabhitahite ratah'—Egoistic ideas are the main stumbling
block for a striver following Sankhyayoga, in the way of God- -
realization. By effacing egoism, in order to realize the automatic .
identity with God, it is necessary to have sentiments.of the welfare, .
of all beings. Those, who rejoice in the welfare of all beings,
can easily wipe out their egoistic thoughts.
He, who wants to identify himself with the all-pervading |
Lord, must remain careful about the welfare of all beings. As a
| person, is careful about the welfare of all the parts of his body,
which have different shapes, names and functions, so does a
striver, think and work for the welfare of all beings, without
any distinction of caste, creed, colour, order of life and spiritual
. practice etc. He beholds the Lord, pervading every being, equally.
Therefore, when a person gets engrossed in the welfare of all
beings, his selfishness easily comes to an end, and he realizes
his identity with God.
‘Chinnadvaidha'—So long as, a striver does not have a firm
resolve to realize God, he has duality, in his mind. But when
"
709,"672 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 5
he has a firm resolve, his doubt or duality disappears, and he
is promptly engaged in spiritual practice.

'Ksinakalmasah'—Affinity for nature (prakrti) is the root, -
of all sins and evils. When a striver realizes, that he (the self)
is different from nature and its evolutes, such as body, senses,
mind and intellect etc., he accordingly becomes free from all
sins and evils.

'Rsayah'—The term 'Rs', means knowledge. He who attaches
importance to knowledge (discrimination), is a 'Rsi' (sage or
holy man). In the olden days, sages attained God-realization,
by leading a householder's life. In this verse also, there is a
description of those strivers, who practise spiritual discipline
with discrimination, in order to realize God while performing
mundane duties. Therefore, strivers who attach importance to -
their discrimination, are also sages (holy men).

'‘Labhante brahmanirvanam'—In fact, Brahma (God) is
attainable by all human beings. But having identified himself -
with the kaleidoscopic body etc., a person has a disinclination
for God. When his affinity for the perishable objects, such as the -
body etc., is renounced, all sins, evils and doubts are destroyed,
and he attains Brahma (God), Who pervades everywhere.

The Lord, explains by the word 'Labhante' (attains), that a
Sankhyayogi merges in Brahma (God), in the same way as waves
merge in sea. As waves, are not different from the sea, as both
of them are one and the same, in the same way, the soul and
the supreme soul, are one and the same.

Appendix—From the view-point of the people a Jnanayog! is
seen to be devoted to the welfare of others (sarvabhutahite ratah)
but in fact he does not do good to others but good (welfare) to
others 1s naturally done by him.

"
710,"Verse 26] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 673

the excellence of such God-realized souls. -

To those wise, who are freed from desire and anger, who have
subdued their minds and who have realized the self for them the
beatitude of God (Brahmic bliss) pervades on all sides. 26
Comment:— |
'Kamakrodhaviyuktanam yatinam'—The Lord declares,
that in the God-realized souls, there remains no trace of evil -
propensities, such as desire and anger etc. Those evil propensities
are born, when man has affinity for the unreal perishable objects
(body, senses, mind and intellect etc.). But when he realizes his -
identity with God, he has no attraction at all for the entire world,
including his body and mind etc. So, there is no question of the -
birth of evils, such as desire and anger, in him. If a striver has
desire and anger even in subtle forms, he should not consider
himself, a liberated soul.
Desire for perishable objects, is 'Kama'. A man, has a desire
only when he lacks something. In‘ Asat (unreal) always there
is deficiency or lacking, while the real self is not wanting in
anything. But, when he (the self) identifies himself with the
unreal, he feels something lacking in him. This want, gives
birth to desire. If desire is not satisfied, anger is born. Thus,
there is no desire in the self, but when It identifies Itself with
the unreal, It seems to have a desire. So how can those, who
have no identity with the unreal and who have realized the self,
experience privation?
Strivers, feel that they are not swayed so much by desire
"
711,"674 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
and anger now, because of their spiritual practice as they were
influenced in the past, without spiritual practice. It shows, that
these feelings have lessened through spiritual practice. It means, _
that they can be wiped out also, by spiritual practices.
Strivers realize (1) desire and anger are not so frequent as
they were in the past, (1) they are not so strong as they were,
in the past, (111) their duration is not so long as, it was in the
past. But, sometimes a striver feels otherwise i.e., he feels that
they are more forceful now, than they were in the past. The
reasons for that are (i) through spiritual practice, attachment for
pleasures is perishing, but perfection is not attained, (ii) because
of the purity of heart and mind, a little desire or anger, seems
too much to a striver, (iii) a striver, feels bad, if anything goes
against his wish but he does not care about it. But this feeling
accumulates. At last, the accumulated feelings blow up, even at i
the slightest provocation. Other people, are also surprised why |
he lost his temper, so easily. _
Sometimes, a striver judges himself by his inclinations, and
holds that he has attained perfection. But, in fact so long as, -
he realizes that he has attained perfection, it means that still
he has some trace of egoism left (individuality) and he has not
attained perfection.
""Yatacetasam'—The mind, is not subdued, so long as, a man
is attached to the unreal. But when great souls renounce this
attachment to the unreal, their minds are subdued.
'Abhito brahmanirvanam vartate viditatmanam'—Those great
souls, who have realized the self, which is the aim of human
life, are called 'Viditatmanam’.
Such great souls, here as well as hereafter, remain established,
in Brahma (God), the abode of eternal peace. As a common
man, while performing different activities, remains established in
his body constantly, so does a great soul remain established in
Brahma constantly, while undertaking different activities, because

he has nothing to do with that non-Self (Asat). :

Comment:— .
'‘SparSankrtva bahirbahyan'—All objects, except God are

external. ‘Shutting out external object’ means, that external

objects should not be thought of. .
The affinity for the external objects, is renounced in the

path of Action, through service, while in the path of knowledge

through discrimination. Here, the Lord declares that this affinity

can be renounced, through meditation. In meditation, when a

striver meditates only on God, he has a disinclination for external
* The path of meditation is an independent means for a striver to realize God

and it can also be used by the strivers following the paths of Action, Knowledge

and Devotion. Chanting the Lord's names, meditation, good company and study

of the scriptures are useful and necessary for every striver. -
"
713,"676 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
objects. It is not the external objects, but his assumed affinity
(attachment) for them, which is an obstacle to God-realization.
'CaksuScaivantare bhruvoh'—Here the expression 'Bhmvoh
antare’, may stand for, fixing vision between the eyebrows as -
well as, for fixing it at the tip of the nose (Gita 6/13).
During meditation, if the eyes are completely shut, a striver
may feel sleepy and if these are completely open, the scene and
objects which are before his eyes, may draw his attention and
create an obstacle. In order to, remove these distractions, it has
been said that with half-closed eyes, the gaze should be fixed,
between one's eyebrows. |
""Pranapanau samau krtva nasabhyantaracarinau'—The breath
exhaled, is 'prana’ while the breath inhaled is 'apana’. The speed
of ‘prana breath’ is fast, while the speed of ‘Apana breath’ is slow. -
In order to, regulate the process of exhalation and inhalation, so
that both of these may take equal time, first, the apana breath
is inhaled, through the left nostril, and then the prana breath is -
exhaled, through the right nostril. Then, the apana breath is inhaled
through the nght nostril and the prana breath is exhaled, through _
the left nostril. This process of exhalation and inhalation, should
take equal time. Through constant practice the flow of the prana
and the apana breath, becomes even, gentle and subtle (thin).
When, there is no sensation of air inside or outside the nostril
and in the throat etc., it should be understood, that the flow of
the prana breath and apana breath, has become even. When this
flow bcomes even, (because of the aim of God-realization), the
mind starts meditating on God. This control of the breathing
process, has been described here, because it plays an important
role, in the path of meditation.
'Yatendriyamanobuddhih'—There are two _ sources of
knowledge—senses and intellect. In between the two, the mind
has its place. A man, is to be cautious, whether his mind is
under the influence of senses or intellect or both senses and
"
714,"Verse 27-28] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 677 |
intellect. Senses, tempt the mind towards sense-objects, while
intellect guides it to think of the consequences. Those people,
whose minds are swayed by senses, indulge in worldly sensual
pleasures, while those, whose minds are guided by intellect, do -
not rejoice in pleasures born of contact (Gita 5/22).

Generally, strivers' minds are controlled, both by senses
and intellect. A sort of struggle goes on, in their minds. They,
neither attach full importance to their discrimination, nor do they
enjoy, worldly pleasures. This dualism (struggle) is an obstacle
to meditation. Therefore, the Lord means to say, that the mind
should be controlled by intellect (discrimination), rather than
by senses.

'Munirmoksaparayanah'—A striver, whose aim is God-
realization, has been called here, 'Moksaparayanah’. As the Lord,
pervades everywhere all the time, He is attainable to all. But He -
is not quickly attained, by people, because they have not a firm
resolve. As soon as they have a firm resolve, He will be realized. -
In fact, the aim (resolve) is pre-determined, because this human
body has been bestowed upon human beings, so that they may
attain God. But, they forget this aim. So they have to realize -
this aim. When they realize this aim, they will have a desire for |
God-realization. This desire, wipes out all the worldly desires
and leads strivers, to God-realization. The Lord, has used this
expression 'Moksaparayanah’, so that a striver may realize, that
his aim is God-realization. :

In all the spiritual disciplines—of Action, of Meditation, of
Devotion and of Knowledge etc., a firm resolve, (aim) plays a
very important role. How can a striver attain perfection or God-
realization, if he has not a firm resolve (aim) to attain Him? So
emphasis has been laid here on a firm resolve by the expression,
'Moksaparayanah’, in the path of meditation.

""'Vigatecchabhayakrodho yah'—We are angry with a man,
who is a stumbling block to the satisfaction of our desires, if
"
715,"678 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
he is weaker than us. But we are afraid, if he is stronger than
us. Similarly, we are afraid of death, if we have a desire to live
and are angry with those, who do not let us fulfil our desires.
Therefore, desire is the root of fear and anger. If a man has only |
the aim of God-realization, he can be free from fear, anger and
desires. As soon as, he is free from desires, he attains liberation
(salvation), as it is the desire to acquire objects and to be alive,
which leads him, to the bondage of birth and. death. A striver
should think seriously, whether he can acquire objects and be
alive, by escaping death merely by having desires. If it is not so,
he should have a firm resolve that he has to realize God only.
By doing so, he can be immediately liberated. But, if he has a
desire to acquire objects and to live, the desire will never be
fulfilled and he cannot be free, from the fear of death as also
from anger. Therefore, it is necessary to be desireless, in. order -
| to be liberated. | |

Things are not acquired by mere desires. To get a thing or -

- not to get a thing, does not depend upon mere desire, but it is
God's dispensation. Then, what is the difficulty in discarding
desires when they cannot procure us objects? No one, can -
escape death and acquire things by desiring. But if desires are
renounced, life can be blissful. If a person has no desire to live,
even death will provide him joy. Life becomes sad, when he has
desires and these are not satisfied; and death appears horrifying,
when he has a desire to live. Therefore, he who has renounced
the desire to acquire things, as well as to live is liberated, even
during this life and he becomes immortal.

'Sad4 mukta eva sah'—The assumption of affinity for the
perishable objects, is bondage while renunciation of this assumed
affinity, is liberation. He, who is liberated is not at all influenced,
by any incident, circumstance, praise, blame, favour, disfavour,
life and death etc. |

The expression 'Sada mukta eva’, shows that in fact, a striver
"
716,"Verse 29] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 679
(the self) is ever liberated, but he cannot realize the reality,
because of his assumed affinity (attachment) for the perishable
world. As soon as, this assumed affinity is renounced, he realizes -
his natural state of liberation or salvation. :
Appendix— ‘Shutting out external objects’ means to detach the
self from the body “I am not the body; the body is not mine and
the body is not for me.” Every striver will have to accept these
three facts whichever spiritual discipline he may follow. If we
don’t accept our affinity for the body, salvation is axiomatic.
In the twenty-fourth verse the term ‘antah’ was used, therefore
here the term ‘bahya’ (external) has been used. In fact there is
nothing external but it is merely an inclination. The term ‘bahya’
is used when we assume that there is another entity but in fact
there is only one entity. Therefore the expression ‘sparsankrtva a
bahirbahyan’ means there should not be the assumption at all
of any other existence besides the Divinity.

Comment:— -
'Bhoktaram yajiiatapasim'—When a person, performs any
good action, he regards the body, senses, mind, intellect and
"
717,"680 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 5
objects etc., with which he performs actions, as his own; and he
regards the person, for whom good action is performed, as the
enjoyer. If he worships a god, he considers, the god as enjoyer,
and if one renders service to a hungry man by offering him _—
food, he considers that hungry man, as the enjoyer of food. In
order to dispel this misunderstanding, the Lord declares that only
God is the enjoyer of all good actions, because He is seated in
the hearts of all.* Therefore, the Lord should be considered the
enjoyer of all virtuous actions, such as adoration and offering
food and water etc., to anyone. A striver, should aim at the Lord,
rather than at beings. a oO

In the twenty-fourth verse of the ninth chapter, also the Lord
declares, ""I alone am the enjoyer of all sacrifices (yajiias).”

Secondly, the body, senses, mind, intellect and objects etc., -
with which virtuous actions are performed, are not a person's
own, these belong to God. By an error, he regards them as his
own; and by regarding them as his own, and performing actions —
for himself with them, he becomes an enjoyer of those actions.
Therefore, the Lord exhorts him, to perform all actions only for -
Him. By doing so, those actions will not bear fruit for him, and
his affinity for actions will be renounced. |

It is desire, which influences a man to perform evil actions.
When he, having renounced desire, performs all actions only for
God, he cannot perform evil actions; and his affinity for virtuous
actions, is also renounced, by performing actions only for Him.
Thus, having renounced affinity for all actions totally, he attains
the Supreme Peace. Oo oo

'SarvalokamaheSvaram'—There may tk different lords, in
different worlds, but all of them are governed by God. So He
is the Supreme Lord of the lords, of all the worlds. It means
that only God is the Lord of the entire creation. So, how can an

* ""He is seated in the hearts of all"" (Gita 13/17); ""I am seated in the hearts of
all"" (Gita 15/15); ""The Lord abides in the hearts of all beings"" (Gita 18/61).
"
718,"Verse 29] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 681
honest man regard anything of the world, as his own?
- Generally, people regard, the bodies, senses, minds, intellects,
life-breaths, families, riches and property etc., as their own,
but they say that God is the Lord of the entire universe. Now -
the question arises, whether it is wise to say so. No, when
people regard, themselves as an owner of every person and
object etc., what remains there is whose lord He is? Therefore,
only he who regards nothing as his, can call, God as the Lord
of the entire universe. |
A man is free to make the right use of objects, such as body
etc., but he is not free to regard these as his own. If he, instead
of regarding these as his own, offers them to God, by regarding
them as His, he attains Supreme Peace. |
‘Suhrdam sarvabhitanam jiiatva mam santimrcchati'—Those,
who know* that God, Who is the Lord of the lords of all the -
worlds, is a disinterested friend of all beings; and no one else
does them so much good as He, and no one preserves them and -
loves them so much as He, they attain Supreme Peace. Why
should we be full of fear, worry, disturbance and disquietude
etc., when the omnipotent Lord is the disinterested friend, of -
all of us?
Only God and his devotees, are interested in the welfare of
living creatures, in a selfless manner. There is nothing unattained
that should be attained (Gita 3/22) by. Him; therefore, He is
naturally a disinterested friend of all. A devotee, also thinks of
the welfare of all beings and does good to them (Srimadbhagavata
3/25/21). The disinterested nature of devotees, has descended
upon them, only from God. |
God is the Enjoyer of all sacrifice and austerities. He is the
great Lord of all the worlds, and He is the most disinterested
friend, of all beings. Out of these three facts if strivers accept just

If they accept all the three, God, is realized instantaneously.

'Desire’, 'a sense of mine for worldly objects’ and ‘disinclination -
for God’, are the three stumbling blocks to God-realization. The
Lord, by the expression 'Bhoktararh yajiiatapasam', means to say,
that a striver should have no desire and should do nothing for
himself. By the expression 'Sarvalokamahesvaram' He means to
say, that he should regard nothing as his i.e., he should renounce
the desire for pleasure, and should not lay claim to objects and
persons. By the expression 'Suhrdam sarvabhutanam’, He says
that he should regard only God as his. If he accepts one of these
facts the remaining two are automatically translated into practice
by him, and he realizes God. -

A man, can renounce desire for pleasure, only if he does not |
regard any being or object as his. If he has a sense of possession
over them, he will expect some reward or the other, from them.
When a striver renounces the desire for pleasure, his sense of = __
mine, is renounced; and if he renounces the sense of mine, his
desire for pleasure is renounced. When he renounces his senses -
of mine for all objects and persons, only God remains his, and
he realizes his real affinity, for Him. As soon as, the desire for
pleasures is renounced, or the sense of ‘mine’ is renounced, or
the striver realizes his real affinity for God, he attains Supreme
Peace, because if he translates anyone of these into practice, the
remaining two, are automatically translated into practice.

A man, should perform action and also know the art of
their performance. He cannot perform actions properly and
scrupulously, without either of the two. Therefore, in the third
chapter, the Lord has laid special emphasis on the performance
of actions, but has also said, that a striver should know what
action is; in the fourth chapter He has laid special emphasis on
the knowledge of the true nature of action, and also mentioned
the necessity of performing action. In the fifth chapter, the Lord
"
720,"Verse 29] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI | 683
has described both the paths of Knowledge (Sankhyayoga) and
of Action (Karmayoga), as means of God-realization, yet He
has declared, that the path of Action is superior, to that of
Knowledge. In this chapter, the Lord having systematically
described the paths of Action and Knowledge, in answer to
Arjuna's question has dealt with the path of meditation, in brief
and of his own accord described the path of Devotion, in the
last thereby expressing his aim that every striver should follow
this path which is the best of all.

Sixth Chapter
INTRODUCTION -

In the beginning of the fifth chapter, Arjuna asked Lord |
Krsna, which of the two, the Discipline of Knowledge or the
Discipline of Disinterested Action, is better. Lord Krsna replied,
""Both of them lead to supreme bliss, but Yoga of action is
superior to the Yoga of knowledge (5/2).""
- Lord Krsna described, upto the twenty-sixth verse of the fifth
chapter, how these lead to supreme bliss. Then, He described
in brief the Discipline of Meditation, in two verses, which is
helpful in the Discipline of Knowledge as well as Action and it
leads to supreme bliss, independently. Then, He concluded the
fifth chapter, by explaining the glory of devotion towards Him _
out of His own wiil.

Lord Krsna in the sixth chapter further explains, the superiority
of the Discipline of Disinterested Action. -

anasritah karmaphalam karyam karma karoti yah
Sa sannyasil ca yogi ca na niragnirna cakriyah
The Blessed Lord said: |

He who undertakes action without desiring its fruit, is both
a Sannyasi (Sankhyayogi) and a Yogi (Karmayogi). He is not a
Sannyasi (renouncer), one who has merely renounced the sacred
fire (ritual) and is not a Karmayogi, who has merely stopped all
actions. (1)
Comment:—

‘Anasritah karmaphalam'—Lord Krsna, appears to say, that a
"
723,"686 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 6
man should not depend on men, things, incidents, circumstances
and actions etc., because they are all perishable and kaleidoscopic,
and he himself, being a fragment of God, is imperishable and
constant. So, how can the perishable, satisfy the imperishable? -
Man thus feels a void. Moreover, he gets attached to them :
and that attachment is the cause of his birth in good and evil
bodies (Gita. 13/21). If he-renounces this attachment, he may
realize emancipation which is axiomatic. In fact, he is naturally
emancipated. But, it 1s because of attachment that he cannot
realize this emancipation. Therefore the Lord declares, that a
person should discharge his duty for duty's sake, without having
any attachment to the fruit of action. Abandoning the fmit of
action, a Yogi attains peace in the form of God-realization;
whereas, he who works with a selfish motive, being attached
to the fruit of action, is bound (Gita 5/12). -
A man, without depending on anyone of the three
bodies—physical, subtle and causal, which are the fruits of
actions, should use them in the welfare of all beings. He should, -
render selfless service to others, with the physical body, think
of the welfare and salvation of others with the subtle-body, and -
offer stability (trance) acquired through the causal body, for the |
welfare of the world. These bodies belong to the world, not to
us and so, they are for the service of the world, not for us. They
have their identity with the world, while they are distinct from
the self. Not to depend on these bodies means, ‘not to expect
the fruit of action’, and to work for the welfare of the world
means, ‘to discharge one's duty’. One who, discharges one's
duty for duty's sake, without expecting its fruit viz., serves the
world, with worldly things. Being a Karmayogi, is extolled as
a Sannyasi in this verse, and one who renounces mineness from
the worldly things, is a Tyagi.i.e., Yogt.
The result, of discharging duty without expecting its fruit,
will be that he will not develop new attachment, as he does not
"
724,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI | 687
perform actions for himself; and old attachment will perish, by
doing good to others. By performing actions, his impulse for
actions will also disappear. Thus renunciation of attachment, _
will spontaneously lead to salvation. The desire, to get hold
of the perishable is bondage, and to renounce this desire is,
emancipation. The method to attain emancipation, is that one
should not depend on the perishable viz., should not have any
affinity for it. | |
'Karyam karma karoti yah'—'Karyam’' and ‘duty’ are
synonyms. What can be easily performed, is a must, and what
can never and be forsaken, is called a duty. Discharge of duty
is not impossible, not even hard. What ought not to be done, is
not duty, it is 'Akartavya’ (that should not be done). Activities,
which ought not to be done are of two types. (1) Those that are _
beyond our capacity. (2) Those which are forbidden by scriptures
and traditions. Such activities, are never to be done. The gist
is, that we should resort to prescribed duties without expecting -
any return, with a detached spirit, for the welfare of others. One
should, discharge one's duty, in accordance with the ordinance _
of scriptures, for the welfare of others and without expecting its
fruit, in order to do away with attachment for action, as well |
as its fruit. | .
Actions, are performed, with two attitudes of mind—for
obtaining worldly things and for wiping out attachment for
actions and their fruits. The inspiration to perform actions, with
the latter attitude, is given here. :
'Sa sannyasi ca yogi ca'—He who, discharges his duty in
the above mentioned way, is a Sannydsi and a Yogi. He is a
Sannyasi, because he discharges his duty without attachment for
action and its fruit and is a Yogi, because he remains equanimous
in pleasure and pain, while discharging his duty.
His sense, of doership and enjoyership, is destroyed by doing
actions without expecting any reward. Thus all his links with
"
725,"688 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
actions, and the fruits are, totally cut asunder. Therefore, that
Karmayogi has been called a ‘Sannyasi.'
_ Arjuna thought it better to renounce the physical performance -

of actions and thus be a Sannyasi. So, in 2/5, Arjuna said, that it
was better to live on alms, than to wage war. So Lord Krsna, says
to Arjuna, ""O Arjuna, the conception you have about a Sannyasi
is not right. He, who discharges his duty for duty's sake, without
being attached to the fruit of action, is a real Sannyasi.""

""Na niragnih'—By forgoing household fire viz., 'Havana' and
sense-objects etc., a person, is not a Sannyasi in the real sense.
Till he has. importance and attraction for material objects, he
cannot be a real Sannyasi. : |

""Na akriyah'—Generally, people think that a Yogi, is he
who abandons all things and actions, and leads a secluded _
life in a state of trance. But, Lord Krsna wants to say, that a
Yogi, is he who discharges his duty, by ceasing to depend on
the perishable viz., without expecting any fruit from action. A -
secluded life, with senses under control, may inspire man to attain
some accomplishments (Siddhi), but it cannot lead him to God- _
realization. By merely discarding actions physically, he cannot be
called, a Karmayogi. A Yogi, in the real sense, is he who performs
his duty and having no dependence at all, on perishable objects.

A man, has an instinct for action. So sometimes, it is
observed that good strivers who attempted to devote themselves
to adoration and meditation in solitude, had to engage themselves
in performing actions, for the welfare of others, by giving up
their secluded life. The momentum of the impulse for action, is
pacified, only when actions are performed selflessly solely for

| the welfare of others. In that case, equanimity is attained and

that equanimity leads to God-realization. |

The feelings, of egoism (I'ness) and attachment or Mineness,
"
726,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 689
are man-made. First, a man accepts that he is a householder, but
when he becomes a Sadhu, he says that he is a Sadhu. Thus his _ |
egoism changes. Similarly, he has attachment for a thing which :
he possesses. But, when he gives it to someone, permanently, he
has no attachment left for it. It proves, that feelings of egoism
and attachment, are not real but are only assumed. Had they been
real, these might not have ceased to be, because 'The real, never
ceases to be' and if it ceases to be, it means that it is not real,
but is unreal, as ""The unreal has no existence’ (Gita 2/16).
The Self (soul), which is the base of egoism and attachment,
is a fragment of God and is ever-existent and has identity with
God, Who pervades everywhere. In the self, there is neither
egoism nor attachment, but man by identifying himself with the a
body and the worldly things, accepts these as in him. Actually,
he is free and capable of identifying himself with them. But, it
is upto him, whether he accepts this identification or does not. -
It is not so, that he is not free or capable to breaking off, this
identification. It is, he himself who has accepted this affinity
with the body and the world, and not otherwise. Therefore, he
who can assume this connection, can also snap it. Every human
being, is free to accept that he is a householder or a Sadhu. —
Similarly he can accept things as his own or not his. He accepts,
that he is a baby, a boy, a youth and an old man at different
stages of life. Similarly, he accepts toys as his own in babyhood
or boyhood while in youth and old age he accepts money and
property etc., as his own. Thus, he can accept an affinity or
renounce it. This affinity, can be renounced easily, because it
is based on mere assumption.
The Self is eternal while the body and the world, are transient.
Therefore, affinity between the eternal and the transient cannot
be everlasting. When the self accepts this affinity, it seems that
egoism and attachment are part and parcel of the self and it is
difficult to renounce them. But it is wrong. This affinity is not
"
727,"690 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
real, it is only an assumed one. Because the self is the uwluminator
and the onlooker, while the body is an object to be illumined and
looked on; the Self is beyond space, while a body is confined -
to space. The self is sentient, while the body is insentient; the ,
self is the knower, while the body is to be known. The Self is
the knower, till relation with the body is there. In the absence of
this relation, the Self is Knowledge-incarnate. In that knowledge,
there is neither ‘I’, nor 'mine’. There is total negation of egoism
and mineness. Thus, they are poles apart. The self, actually is
none else, but the Absolute, Who neither has, nor had, nor will
have egoism and attachment, or mineness in the least. |
Appendix—The entire universe from an ant upto the abode
of Brahma, is the fruit of action. The world is formed of objects,
persons and actions. Everything is acquired and is-lost, there is ~- :
union and disunion of every person, and every action begins
and ends. The man, who having renounced dependence on the
three—things, persons and actions, discharges his duty, is a true :
Sannyasi and a Yogi. He who, without renouncing the desire.
for the fruit of action, renounces mere sacred fire, is not a true ~
sannyasi and he, who renounces performance of actions, is not
a true Yogi. The reason is that a man gets bound by desire for
the fruit of actions, not by fire or actions.
In the third verse of the third chapter the Lord mentioned
the two fold path—the path of knowledge and the path of action.
Then in the fourth and the fifth verses of the fifth chapter the
Lord mentioned that both Sankhyayoga and Karmayoga bear
the same fruit. Now the Lord with the same notion declares
that he who has renounced the desire for the fruit of action, is
a real Sankhyayogi and a real Karmayogi. It means that by mere
cessation of the functions of the mind a man does not become a
Yogi. He becomes a Yogi only when he renounces the desire for
the fruit of actions. The reason is that so long as the the desire
for the fruit of actions persists, by cessation of the functions
"
728,"Verse 2] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 691
of mind ‘Siddhis’ (occult powers or accomplishments) can be
achieved, but salvation can not be attained.

who is a Sannyasi is a Yogi. So, in the next verse, Lord Krsna
explains the relationship between Karma Sannyasa (Discipline
of Knowledge) and Karmayoga (Discipline of Action).

O Pandava, what they speak of as Sannydsa, know that to ~
be the same as Karma Yoga; for none becomes a Yogi without
renouncing thought of the world. 2
Comment:— a |

'Yam sannyasamiti prahuryogarn tara viddhi pandava'—In the
beginning of the fifth chapter, Lord Krsna explained, that the Yoga ;
of Knowledge and the Yoga of Action, both lead to Supreme
Bliss (5/2), and the supreme state, is attained equally by both
the means (5/5) viz., both of them are the same. Similarly, here
He points out, that as a Sannydsi is a renouncer, a Karmayog, :
is also a renouncer.

In the ninth verse of the eighteenth chapter also, Lord Krsna
says, ""An action which is performed as a duty, giving up attachment
and fruit, is regarded as ‘Sattvika’ form of renunciation."" By
this renunciation, a man becomes a renouncer, or a Yogi, as
he totally gets detached, from objects and actions. Similarly, a
Sannyasi renounces doership, and is thus a renouncer. It means,
that there is no difference between a Yogi and a Sannyasi viz.,
both are the same. Therefore, Lord Krsna, in the third verse of
the fifth chapter, said, ""The Karmayogi should ever be considered
"
729,"692 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
a Sannyasi (renouncer), for he has transcended the pairs of
opposites, such as attachment and aversion.""

""Na hyasannyastasankalpo yogi bhavati kaScana'—Different -
thoughts come into the mind. The thought for which there is
attachment or aversion of the mind, becomes a 'sankalpa' (pursuit of
the mind). Without renouncing that pursuit, no one can become a
Yogi (Sankhyayogi or Karmayog!), but he is a voluptuary, because
union (affinity) for God is Yoga’, and one who has a desire for
pleasure, is a voluptuary, not a ""Yog?’, because instead of attachment
for God, he is attached to pleasure. But, when he renounces, the

_ desire for the unreal, he becomes a renouncer and realizes his
eternal union, with God. As men are sensual, so are birds and
animals, because they have also, not renounced pursuits of the mind.

It means, that so long as there is the least affinity for the Se
unreal, a man cannot become a ""Yogr’, in spite of a lot of practice,
trance and a secluded life, according to the gospel of the Gita.

Though the process of Discipline of Sannyasa, and that of 7
Yoga, are different, yet as far as renunciation of the pursuits of
the mind is concerned, both are, one and the same. -

aruruksormuneryogam karma  k4ranamucyate

yogariidhasya tasyaiva Samah karanamucyate

To the contemplative soul (muni) who desires to attain to the
height of Karmayoga (in the form of equanimity), action without
motive, is said to be the means. For the same person when he
masters Yoga, serenity (tranquillity of mind) is said to be the
means, to God-realization. 3
"
730,"Verse 3] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 693
Comment:—
‘Aruruksormuneryogam karma kdranamucyate'—He, who
desires to rise to the heights of Yoga (equanimity), action without :
motive, is spoken of as the means. Every human being, who .
is born, nourished and is living his life has been dependent on
others. Al] his possessions, body, senses, mind, intellect and ego
all are evolutes of nature. Therefore, till he through these does
not render service to others, he will not rise to the height of
Karmayoga, or in other words, he will not attain equanimity. It
means, that a man should discharge his duty, by rendering service
to others with all his means, because whatever means (including
his body, senses, mind, intellect and ego) he possesses, belong
to society; and all the things have identity with the world, not
with the self. By rendering service to others, the flow of actions, -
will be directed towards the world, and man himself will attain
equanimity. The same fact, has been explained, by Lord Krsna
(in Gita 4/23), ""He, who performs actions, for the welfare of -
others, his actions melt away viz., do not lead him to bondage.""
And, in Gita 3/9 He declares, ""Man is bound by actions, other -
than those performed for the sake of sacrifice viz., he is bound,
when he performs these with a selfish motive.""
How is action without motive, the means to rise to the heights
of Karmayoga (equanimity)? The answer is, that our equanimity
will be judged, only when we perform actions. While performing
actions if we aim to remain equanimous, in pleasure and pain,
it means that our action, is the means to rise to the height of
Yoga, otherwise not.
""Yogariidhasya tasyaiva Samah karanamucyate’'—Affinity for
the unreal, causes disquietude, because the Self is eternal and
permanent, while all the worldly objects such as bodies etc.,
are transient and kaleidoscopic. But when the Self accepts his
affinity with them and foresees their destruction or they actually
perish, he becomes disquiet. But, if he utilizes them in rendering
"
731,"694 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA _ [Chapter 6
service to others, his affinity breaks off, he rises to heights of
Yoga and attains, tranquillity. If he enjoys that. tranquillity, it
will delay his progress. But, if he does not get attached to it,
: and does not enjoy it, that tranquillity becomes the means of
his God-realization. |
Appendix—The striver who desires to attain to the height
of Karmayoga (equanimity), action without motive is said to be
the means; and the serenity thus attained, is-the: means to God-
realization. It means that an action is not the means to attain
God but serenity attained by renouncing affinity for actions, 1s
the reason. This serenity is a means rather than an end. ©
‘When actions are performed discriminately, attachment
(impetus) to actions is wiped out, because actions have no power
to wipe out attachment but through discrimination it is possible. = -
He, who desires to attain to the height of Karmayoga, performs
_ all actions discriminately. When discrimination develops, then
/ a striver realizes helplessness in the fulfilment of his desire —
and feels a lack (shortage) in its unfulfilment. No one wants
dependence and shortage but a man does not get rid of these :
_two by having a desire. '
Having attained to the height of Karmayoga, a striver should
not be pleased because this pleasure will arrest his progress
and so God-realization will be delayed (Gita 14/6). As a boy
takes interest in games and sports, but when he grows up, he
starts taking interest in earning money, then his taste for play
is naturally wiped out. Similarly until God is realized, a striver
relishes serenity. But if he does not relish that serenity and
becomes indifferent to it, his relish is naturally wiped out and
very soon he realizes God. - |
To attain to the height of yoga, action is the means viz.,
while performing actions for the welfare of others without any
selfish motive, a striver gets detached from all actions etc., then
he attains to the height of yoga. Actions come to an end but
"
732,"Verse 4] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 695
yoga (equanimity) ever persists. |

A Karmi (Bhogi) performs actions and a Karmayogi also
performs actions but there is a vast difference in their aims. The -
former performs actions to satisfy his desire, while the latter :
performs actions in order to renounce attachment. A ‘Bhogi’
(pleasure-seeker) works for himself while a Karmayogi works
for others. Therefore though both are equal as far as performance
of actions with attachment is concerned, yet the striver who
works for others in order to renounce attachment, attains to the
height of yoga. A yogi’s equanimity will be judged only when
he performs actions without attachment ‘vrddha nari pativrata’

(an old woman is chaste).

What has been called ‘Sama’ (serenity)) here, the same has |
been called ‘prasada’ (placidity or purity of mind) (Gita 2/64). If a -
striver does not take delight in this serenity, he attains everlasting
peace (Supreme Bliss) (Gita 6/15). Renunciation of the fruit of
action leads to supreme peace (Gita 12/12). If a striver does not :
take delight in peace (serenity), he attains uninterrupted relish
(Self-realization) and if he is not satisfied with ‘akhanda rasa’ -
(unbroken relish), he attains infinite Bliss (supreme love). |

yada hi nendriyarthesu na karmasvanusajjate

sarvasankalpasannyasi yogaridhastadocyate

When a man ceases to have any attachment, either for the
objects of senses or for actions (Karma) and has renounced all
thoughts of the world, he is said to have attained Yoga and is |
called Yogariidha. 4
"
733,"696 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
Comment:— .

""Yada hi nendriyarthesu na karmasvanusajjate'—Firstly, a
striver should not be attached to objects of five senses—sound,
touch, colour, taste, smell; to favourable circumstances, incidents, _
men, comfort, respect and praise etc. He should not enjoy them,
and should not be pleased with them. He should remain detached,
by thinking that all of these are transient and perishable.

The means to get detached from the objects of senses, is not
to derive pleasure out of fulfilment of desires. One should not
be pleased with desirable objects, circumstances, incidents and
persons etc. If he derives pleasure out of sense-objects, these
enhance attachment. Therefore, a striver should, neither desire
favourable circumstances, nor derive pleasure out of them. In ~

_ this way, his’senses will not get attached, to sense-objects. _

Secondly, a man feels absence of favourable objects etc.,

_ without acquiring these and having acquired them, he becomes
: a slave to them. Actually, he is a slave in both the cases. First, _
he was a slave because he wanted to acquire them, and then he
became a slave, lest they should slip away. But in the second -
case, he does not realize his servility. He rather feels, that with
their acquisition he is free. This is mere deception. Similarly,
deriving pleasure out of favourable circumstances, is a deception,
as such pleasure, spoils his nature and gives birth to desire,
to enjoy pleasure, again and again. This desire for pleasure,
misleads him to the shackles of birth and death. To desire, and
to expect favourable circumstances, and then to feel happy on
their acquisition is the root of all miseries and sins. If this desire
is discarded, a man attains equanimity. _ )

: Thirdly, whatever extra money and objects, besides our
necessities, we possess are not ours, they are of the poor and the
needy. So, we should hand these over to the poor and the needy
people, and should think that by doing so, we are free from debt.
Thus, we shall not get attached, to objects and riches etc.
"
734,"Verse 4] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 697
'Na karmasvanusajjate'*—As a striver, should not be attached
to objects of sense, he should also not be attached, to actions and
their fruits. If action is performed well, it gives pleasure, but if -
it is not, it gives pain. This pleasure or pain, is attachment by
action. So a striver, should perform actions carefully and efficiently
without being attached to them, because they are transient, while
his self, is eternal. So how can they have any effect on him? He
is affected only, when he is attached to them, and that attachment
misleads him to the cycle of birth and death. So, he should not
be attached either to objects of senses or to actions. By doing —
so, he becomes completely detached from nature, which consists
of only actions and objects. Thus he attains Yoga.
Here a point needs attention that generally there is attachment
to actions for their fruits and the fruits are the pleasures. So, if ~
this attachment for pleasure perishes, attachment to actions will
also perish. Then, why has Lord Krsna mentioned cessation of ;
attachment to actions? The reason is, that there is an independent
attachment for actions also. Even without a desire for fruit,
there is a momentum of impulse for actions; so a man wants: -
to perform an action. A man, ceases to have that attachment
by performing actions, either for others or for God. So, Lord
Krsna, in the twelfth chapter, first exhorted Arjuna to seek to
attain Him, through Yoga (Discipline) of practice. But, if he
was unable to practice, Lord Krsna asked him, to be intent on
performing actions for Him (12/10). It means, that a striver who
cannot concentrate his mind, on God and if there is an inner urge
for actions, he should perform actions, only for God. Thus, the
attachment of a striver, who follows the Discipline of Devotion,
* Here the term 'Karmasu' has been used in the plural number which shows
that the man who is attached to actions has a desire to perform several actions
and reap their fruits. But in the forty-fifth verse of the eighteenth chapter the
term ‘Karmani' has been used in the singular number in order to show that a man
free from attachment performs several actions with one intellect that he has to
perform his duty.
"
735,"698 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
will be blotted out. Similar, will be the result, in case of a striver
who follows the Discipline of Action, if he performs actions,
for the welfare of others. oo -
- As there is, attachment for action, there is also attachment,
for inaction. A striver, should have no attachment for inaction
also, because inaction causes idleness and laziness, which are
""Tamasika' traits; while attachment to action, misleads to futile
- pursuits with ""Rajasika’ traits. |
How long will a striver take, to rise to the height of Yoga?
To answer this question, Lord Krsna has used the terms ""Yada’
~ and ""Tada' viz., ‘when' and ‘then’. It means, that as soon as, he
ceases to have any attachment for the objects of senses, and for
actions, he attainsYoga.

Man himself, being. a fragment of God, is eternal and - |
free but he gets attached to the perishable worldly bodies and
objects, the evolutes of nature and this attachment leads him to
bondage. If he has a firm determination, not to enjoy worldly —
objects and actions today, he will at once attain Yoga, because
Yoga (equanimity) is axiomatic. We do not realize it (the real), -
because we are attached tothe unreal. |

‘Sarvasankalpasannyasi'—Out of all 'sphuranas’; the 'sphurana’,
which is pleasing and to which we are attached, becomes a
‘sankalpa'. | Lo

This 'sankalpa' proves to be pleasant or unpleasant, because of
favourable or unfavourable circumstances. A man, has attachment
to favourable circumstances, while he has aversion for the
unfavourable ones. Thus, this 'sahkalpa’ being always harmful
leads to nothing but bondage. It is conducive, neither to Self-
realization, nor to selfless service or to devotion to God or for
good relations, with the family. Thus, a striver should renounce,
this 'Sankalpa’, by thinking that it involves neither one’s own
welfare nor of the world, it is conducive neither to the service of
the family nor to God-realization (Self-realization). So, a striver
"
736,"Verse 4] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 699 ,
should be free, from all 'sankalpas' (thoughts of the world).

If a striver, does not get attached to the thought, it is a
'sphurana’. If a 'sphurana’ does not assume the shape of a 'sankalpa’, -
it vanishes naturally. This 'sphurana’, should also be renounced,
because it wastes time though it does not cause much harm and a |
downfall. But a striver must renounce 'sankalpas', because without
renouncing them, he does not attain Yoga; and without attaining
Yoga he does not realize God. Something remains to be done by him
and his human life is not successful. He does not develop devotion
to God and he does not, become totally free from sufferings. _

In the second verse of this chapter, the Lord declares, by a
negative inference, that none becomes a Yogi without renouncing
thoughts of the world, while in this verse He declares more —
positively that a man attains Yoga, by renouncing thoughts of -
the world. It means, that a striver should have no thought of
the world in the least. : |

(i) God has bestowed this human birth, the last of all births -
upon us, by His grace for our salvation. So, we have not to waste
this valuable time of human life, in futile thought of the world.

By thinking so, the pursuit of mind, can be renounced.

(ii) A striver, following the Discipline of Action, has to :
discharge his duty, without attachment (Gita 3/19) at present, —
while the thoughts that come to his mind, are either of the past
or the future. So a striver, should not be entangled in them.

(iii) A striver, following the Discipline of Devotion, should
think that God is existent here and now, He is his and is in
him, while the thoughts that come to the mind, are either of the
past or the future. So, it is a blunder to think of the pursuits,
which do not exist now, but not to think of God, Who has His
existence now. By thinking so, a striver should renounce all
thoughts of the world.
"
737,"700 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6

""Yogariidhastadocyate'—Equanimity, in success and failure, is
called Yoga (Gita 2/48). Attainment of equanimity is attainment
of Yoga. Equanimity leads to God-realization. In the second verse
of this chapter, Lord Krsna declared, that none becomes a Yogi _
without renouncing the thoughts of the world, and here, He has
declared that by renouncing all thoughts of the world, a man is
said to have attained Yoga. It proves, that all the Disciplines as
that of Knowledge, or that of Action, lead to attainment of Yoga
(Gita 5/5) as both disciplines culminate in the renunciation of
all thoughts of the world.

Appendix—What is the mark of the yogi who has attained
to the height of Karmayoga? For this the Lord has mentioned
three factors—not to be attached to objects (things and persons),
not to get attached to actions; and to renounce ail thoughts
of the world viz., to renounce one’s own will. It means that
he should not be attached to sensual pleasures and actions
and should not insist from within that it should occur and it _
should not occur. He, who is neither attached to objects nor
to the lack of objects; is neither attached to actions nor to the _
lack of actions and who has no ‘Sankalpa’ (projection of the
mind), is said to attain to the height of Karmayoga. It means
that he should not insist on availability or non-availability of
objects, union or disunion of persons and performance or non-
performance of actions (Gita 3/18).

A striver should reflect upon whether there is anything which
will ever stay with us and with which we shall ever stay. Is
there any person who will ever live with us and with whom we
shall ever live? Is there any action which we shall ever go on
performing and which will ever be performed by us? Neither
a thing nor a person nor an action will ever stay with us. One
day we shall be devoid of a thing, a person and an action. If
we accept their disunion at present and get detached from them,
then freedom from the bondage of worldly life is axiomatic. It
"
738,"Verse 4] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 701
means that the union with things, persons and actions is transient
but their disunion is eternal. By accepting the eternal fact, the
eternal divinity 1s attained and no lack remains.
Detachment from sense-objects and actions means—freedom
from desire and from. the sense of doership. If a striver is not
attached to pleasures and objects, he becomes free from desires;
and if he is not attached to actions, he becomes free from the
sense of doership. Being free from desire and from the sense
of doership, he naturally gets established in the self. In fact he
does not get established but he is already established but he does
not realize it because of his desire and the sense of doership. If
there is absence of desire and the sense of doership, the striver
realizes his self-evident abode in the self.
As while writing, we use a pen and we put the pen in its BS
original position as soon as the writing is over, similarly a striver
should use the body, while working and put (leave) it in its -
original position as soon as the work is over viz., should get
detached from it; then after every action he will be established
in yoga (equanimity). If he is totally detached from actions, he .
will attain to the height of yoga. . :
Attachment to Kriya (pleasure) and objects (prosperity) leads
to ruin (downfall) (Gita 2/44), therefore a striver should neither
be attached to actions nor to the fruit of actions (Gita 2/47, 5/12).
He should not enjoy pleasure born of his resolve viz., he should
not derive pleasure from the fulfilment of his resolve. He should
not resolve even for his salvation because the resolve for salvation
strengthens (the existence of) bondage. Therefore renouncing all
worldly thoughts he should remain quite indifferent.

uddharedatmanatmanam natmanamavasada yet

- atmaiva hyatmano bandhuratmaiva ripuratmanah

Let a man emancipate himself by his own self; and not degrade
himself; for he himself is his friend as well as his enemy. 5
Comment:—

'Uddharedatmanatmanam'—A man should lift himself by his
own self. It means, that he should lift himself, above the body,
senses, mind, intellect and life-breath, because all of these belong _
to matter (nature) and have identity with matter, while his self,
is a fragment of God and has identity -with Him. It also means, -
that he should lift himself from the limited 'T’, to the unlimited :
‘Self. So, for God-realization, there is no need to depend, on
the insentient, the unreal, because attachment for the unreal, or _
dependence on the unreal, is the main obstacle to God-realization.
There is no need of the body, senses, mind and intellect, to attain
God Who is one's own. He, is in him, exists now and here,
because the real cannot be attained by the unreal, the real, can
be attained by renouncing connection with the unreal.

Secondly, as it was explained in the previous verse, a
man should cease to have any attachment for objects, actions
and thoughts, and raise himself above them. It is everyone's
experience, that objects, actions and thoughts, have a beginning
and an end. They are born and decay; are united and disunited,
but his self remains the same, without the least modification. |
Therefore; detachment from these means, lifting himself by his
own self.

Man possesses discrimination, by utilizing which, a striver
"
740,"Verse 5]. SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 703
can lift himself and can realize God. A striver, by following the
Discipline of Knowledge, can discriminate between the real and
the unreal, and thus get established in his own self. A striver, _
following the Discipline of Devotion, accepts that he is God's
and God is his, and this feeling leads him to God-realization. A
striver, following the Discipline of Action, by using discrimination,
utilizes the so-called body, senses, mind and intellect in rendering
service to others and thus by breaking off his affinity with them,
gets established, in his own self. Thus, his discrimination leads
him to God-realization, whatever discipline, he may follow.
Think of—T am not body’, because the body changes, while
J remain the same; ""This body is not mine’, because I cannot keep _
this body healthy, and in my possession, as long as I wish; ""This
body is not for me’, because if it had been for me, I might have -
not had any other desire. Secondly, this body is changeful, while :
I am eternal. How can this kaleidoscopic body, be of any use to
the eternal 'Self'? Thirdly, if it had been for me, it would have -
lived with me forever, but it does not live. Therefore, if a man
thinks seriously, and sticks to the thought, 'I am not body’, ""The
body is not mine’ and ""The body is not for me’, he will realize
God spontaneously.
Now, a question arises, why Lord Krsna has said, that a
man should lift himself by his own self, when God, preceptors,
saints and scriptures, also lead a man to God-realization. The
answer 1s, that all of them will lead us to God-realization, only
if we have faith in them; and it depends upon us, whether we
have faith or we do not. It is, because of the lack of faith and |
desire, that several incarnations of the Lord, and many saints and
liberated souls, could not enable us to realize God. But, those
who had faith in them, realized Him. Therefore, a striver by
having faith in them and by obeying them should realize God. It
"
741,"704 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6

is an unique opportunity for us, that this human body has been
bestowed upon us in this Kali-Age, so that we may realize God,

not only once, but several times during this life. But, we can -
realize Him, only when we ourselves want to do so. |

Secondly, man has degraded himself, as he has accepted his
affinity for the world, the world has not accepted that affinity, —
which breaks off, every moment. If one does not accept any
new affinity, he may realize God.

""Natmanamavasadayet'—He, should not degrade himself. It
means that he himself being uniform and sentient, should not
enslave himself, by having dependence on the transient and
insentient worldly objects, such as riches, ranks etc. By virtue
of his riches and ranks, he assumes himself to be elevated. This
elevation, is of his virtues rather than his own. This dependence —
amounts to his degradation. But, how shocking and surprising it
is, that he regards this degradation as promotion, and dependence ”
as independence! |

‘Atmaiva hyatmano bandhuh'—A man, himself is his friend,
when he accepts that there is no need for mundane things, such -
as body, senses, mind, intellect etc:, in God-realization. Secondly,
he should have faith in his guide, in God, saints and scriptures.

They will lead him to God-realization. By having this faith, he
himself is his friend.

‘Atmaiva ripuratmanah'—He himself, is his enemy, when
he accepts his affinity with the worldly body, senses and
mind etc. : |

In the second line of the verse, the term ‘Eva’ (only), has
been used twice, to emphasize the fact, that he and only he
himself, is his friend and foe; anyone else, neither is, nor can
be his friend and foe. By accepting his affinity with the world,
he is his enemy and by accepting no affinity in the least, with
the world, he is his friend.

Appendix—A man himself, rather than anybody else, is
"
742,"Verse 5] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 705
responsible for his salvation (God-realization) or for his downfall.
God has bestowed upon us this human body and he has also
gifted us with all the requisites. Therefore for salvation no other ~
person is needed, similarly no one else is responsible for our
fall. The person himself by becoming attached to the modes,
takes repeated birth and death (Gita 13/21).
Preceptor (spiritual guides), saints and God lead a man
to salvation when a man himself has faith and belief in them,
accepts them, has an inclination towards them, takes refuge in
them and carries out their orders. If he does not accept them as
their own, how will they lead him to salvation? They can’t. If
he does not became a disciple, what will the ‘guru’ (spiritual
guide) do? As other persons will provide food to a (hungry)
man but the hunger should be his own. If he has no hunger of —
his own, what is the use of the food provided to him by others?
Similarly if a striver is not sincerely devoted to his aim, what is :
the utility of the gospel preached by the spiritual guide, saints .
and exalted souls?
There is never lack of spiritual guides, saints and God. There -
have been many great saints, preceptors and incarnations, but we
have not attained salvation. It proves that we have not accepted
them. Therefore we ourselves are responsible for our salvation
and ruin. He, who thinks others responsible for his salvation and
fall, can never attain salvation.
In fact God is present, the preceptor is present, the supreme
truth is present and ability and strength in a striver are also
present. The only obstacle to their revelation, is the attachment
to the perishable pleasures. The responsibility to wipe out this
attachment to pleasures, goes to the striver because he himself
has been attached to them.
Initiation (initiating or being initiated) is not the principle of
the Gita. A man is his own preceptor, therefore he has to preach
the gospel to his own self. When all is God (Vasudevah sarvam),
"
743,"706 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 6

then who except God is a preceptor and who will preach the
gospel and to whom will he preach it? Therefore the expression
‘uddharedatmanatmanarh’ means that instead of perceiving defects -
in others, a man should perceive defects in his own self and try

to get rid of them and preach the gospel to himself. He himself
should become his preceptor, he himself should become his
leader and he himself should become his ruler.

he himself, his friend or enemy? The Lord, provides an answer,
in the verse that follows. |

SRNR SATA FS:

SIS MATA ATH STAN .

bandhuratmatmanastasya yenatmaivatmana _jitah

anatmanastu§ Satrutve vartetaétmaiva Séatruvat

To him, who has conquered his self by himself, his own self
is a friend; but to him who has not conquered the self, his own
self acts as his foe. 6
Comment:—

""Bandhuratmatmanastasya yenatmaivatmana jitah'—Nothing
resides, in a man except, the pure self. He does not at all depend,
on the lower self viz., body, senses, mind and intellect etc. He
renounces his dependence on these altogether, and gets established
in his own self. He is the one, who has conquered himself.

How to know, that a man is established in his own self?
When his mind is set well in equanimity, it means that he is |
established in his own self, because the Absolute is, free from
blemish and is equanimous (Gita 5/19). It means that by being
established in the Absolute he has conquered himself by his
own self. Actually he was already established in the Absolute,
"
744,"Verse 6] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 707
but he could not realize it, as he had assumed his body, mind .
and intellect etc., as his. .

In this world, a man cannot defeat anyone without the help -
of others, and this help of others, means his own defeat. How? :
For example, if you want to defeat others, either with arms or |
with arguments, you have to depend on arms or arguments, then |
only, you can defeat others. It means that you are first defeated, :
by arms or arguments. Thus one cannot conquer others, without
his own defeat. But, one who has no need of others, in the least,
conquers himself by his own self, and he himself, is his friend.

'Anatmanastu Satrutve vartetatmaiva Satruvat'—He, who thinks,
that the body, senses, mind, intellect, riches and prosperity etc.,
are necessary, for him and who depends on them, is his own foe.

He thinks, that by accepting these as his own, he has controlled -
them and conquered them. But, the fact is, that he has been

defeated by them. When he takes his defeat as victory, it means
that his own self, is his foe. |

The term 'Satrutve', means that a man by depending on
worldly things, and by accepting his affinity with them, works _
as a foe for himself, as he himself, is sentient, but he attaches
importance to the insentient and depends on them. The more
claim, he lays on material objects, the more he becomes, a slave
to them. Further, he harbours desire for respect, honour and fame,
that lead to his fall. He concedes, that he is elevating himself
but actually it is the reverse. This proves, that he himself, is his
own enemy, in disguise.

How surprising it is, that a man by attaching importance to
matter, by forgetting God-realization, as the real aim of human life,
wants to maintain the memory of his so-called body, and name
by his photos and statues, during the lifetime, as well as after
death! Thus, he in spite of being sentient (self), gets entangled
in the slavery of matter, (non-self) and acts as his foe.

By using the term ‘Satruvat', Lord Krsna means to explain, :
"
745,"708 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
that a man by accepting his affinity with the body, senses, mind
and intellect etc., thinks that he has become their master but
actually he is their slave. Though, he does not think of harm
to himself, yet the consequences are harmful and ruinous, and
so Lord Krsna has declared, that his own self acts as his foe,
because, dependence on the mundane, finally misleads a man,
to the cycle of birth and death.
Appendix—If a man has not the sense of ‘I? and ‘mine’ in
respect of his body, he himself is his friend and if he has the
sense of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ in the body, he himself is like an enemy
to himself viz., by giving existence to the non-self, he acts like
an enemy to himself. ‘Satruvat’—-Whatever loss an enemy causes,
the same loss he himself incurs. In fact as much loss a voluptuary
does to himself, so much loss can’t be done even by an enemy. -
If we perceive in the right perspective, we come to know that
an enemy does only good to us. He cannot do evil to us. The -
reason is that he can have an access only to objects, he can’t
reach the self. Therefore what more can he do than to destroy
the perishable? The destruction of the perishable will do us -
good only. In fact we sustain loss only, if we nurse ill-feelings.

The self-conquered one whose mind is perfectly calm, in the
midst of antithetical pairs, such as cold and heat, favourable and
unfavourable, joy and sorrow, honour and dishonour, is in constant
communion with, the Supreme-Spirit. 7
"
746,"Verse 7] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 709
Comment:—
[In the sixth verse, the term 'Anatmanah' (of unconquered
self), and the term 'Jitatmanah' (of the self-controlled), have been _
used. It means that man who accepts his affinity of ‘I'ness and
‘Mineness', with the body etc., his own self, acts as the foe.
But a self-controlled person, who does not accept his affinity,
with mundane objects, such as body etc., as his own self is his
friend. In this way, the man of unconquered self, ruins himself,
while a self-controlled man, remains in communion with the
Supreme-Spirit. ]
'Jitatmanah'—One, who has not the least, affinity with the
mundane, such as body, senses, mind and intellect etc., is self-
disciplined or self-controlled. Such a self-controlled man, does
good to himself, as well as to the world. | _
'‘Sitosnasukhaduhkhesu prasantasya'—Here, ‘Sita’ and ""Usna’
do not denote only cold and heat, ‘Sita’ and 'Usna’ are merely, -
objects of touch. A self-controlled person, is really he who :
controls all senses, from sense-objects. Therefore, ‘Sita’ and
'‘Usna’, cannot be taken in a limited sense. They denote, favourable -
and unfavourable circumstances. It means, that one should not
be pleased with favourable circumstances and incidents etc., or
displeased with unfavourable circumstances and incidents etc.,
but remain perfectly calm, in the midst of the two.
In favourable circumstances, a man feels a sort of, coolness,
while in unfavourable circumstances he feels a kind of warmth.
A striver, should be cautious that his permanent peace is not
disturbed, by this seemingly cold and heat. He should not be happy
and sad, with favourable and unfavourable circumstances.
Now let us try to understand what ‘Joy’, and ‘Sorrow’, imply: :
(i) Generally, people think that a person who lives in luxury
is joyful, but one who cannot enjoy luxuries, is sorrowful.
(ii) A man, does not possess even the bare necessities of
"
747,"710 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
life, but is satisfied with what he possesses, and is joyful, while
the man who leads a life of luxury is worried at heart, lest the
luxuries should be lost and is sad or sorrowful. _
In the Gita, 'sukha’ and ‘duhkha’, have been described,
in two ways. The favourable circumstances and pleasure
derived out of these is called ‘sukha’. Similarly, unfavourable
circumstances and sorrow derived from these is called 'duhkha’.
Where in the Gita it is said, 'samaduhkhasukhah' (12/13; 14/24),
'sitosnasukhaduhkhesu samah' (12/18), it means, that he remains
evenminded in 'sukha’, and ‘duhkha'. But where the Gita says,
‘Dvandvairvimuktah sukhaduhkhasanjfiath’, there, it refers to
the void of 'sukha' (pleasure) and ‘duhkha (pain). In the former
case, ‘sukha' and ‘duhkha’, have their entities but one remains
equanimous, without being affected by them. In the latter case, _
there is no entity of either 'sukha' or ‘duhkha’. In sum total, both
lead to the same goal. | | -
Now, a question rises, why Lord Krsna, has used two pairs _~
of opposites 'Sita and Usna'’ (coldandheat) and 'Sukhaduhkha’
| (joy and sorrow), when ‘cold’ and ‘heat’ also stand for favourable = -
and unfavourable circumstances. The explanation, is that past- _
actions result in favourable and unfavourable circumstances,
while actions of the present, result in success and failure, (joy
and sorrow). But a self-controlled man, remains perfectly calm
and serene, in both states.
This explanation, seems to fit the context, because the
expression 'Nendriyarthesu anusajjate', used in the fourth verse
of this chapter, has been referred to here, by the expression ‘Sita-
Usna’', while the expression 'Na karmasu anusajjate’ used there has
been specified by the expression ‘Sukha-Duhkha’. It means, that |
where it is mentioned that he remains detached in favourable and
unfavourable circumstances as a result of the fruit of past actions,
while in success and failure, as the fruit of present actions. Here,
it is mentioned that he remains calm, in both cases.
"
748,"Verse 7] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 71

'Tatha mandpamanayoh'—He is perfectly calm in honour and
dishonour also. Now, a question arises, that honour or dishonour,
is also a result of actions of the past, and therefore, is included _
in favourable and unfavourable circumstances. The explanation,
is that in favourable and unfavourable circumstances, no one else,
becomes an instrument, while in honour and dishonour (including
praise and censure), someone else, becomes the instrument. But,
the self-controlied man remains calm, whether he is honoured
or dishonoured, by others. |

In honour, a striver should not think that it is the result of
his virtuous or good actions, but he should consider it, a virtue of
the person who has shown honour to him. While, he should think _
of dishonour, as a result of his past actions, and feel obliged to
the other person, who has purged him of his sins, by becoming
an instrument of dishonour. Thus a striver, will become calm
in honour and dishonour.

'‘Paramatma samahitah'—Equanimity, in cold and heat, joy and -
sorrow, honour and dishonour, proves that he has attained God-
realization, because without internal bliss, a man cannot remain
calm, in both favourable and the unfavourable circumstances,
success and failure or honour and dishonour. Therefore, Lord
Krsna, in the Gita has declared in 5/19, ""Men whose mind is
established in equanimity, have conquered, the mortal plane"";
and in 6/22, He declares, ""Getting into the infinite beatitude of
the Self, he does not reckon any other gain greater than that,
and wherein established he is not moved, even by the heaviest
affliction"" and so on.

Appendix—He, whose own self is like a friend viz., who has
not the sense of ‘I’ and ‘mine’ in the body, remains equanimous
and unaffected in favourable and unfavourable circumstances,
pleasure and pain, honour and dishonour. Such a man is an
"
749,"712 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA (Chapter 6
enlightened Karmayogt viz., he has realized God—this should
be recognised. The reason is that favourable and unfavourable
circumstances, pleasure and pain, honour and dishonour are -
fleeting but God ever remains the same. .

same, is spoken of, as one who has attained God-realisation. 8
Comment:— a _

' Jianavijhanatrptatma'—It is in the context of the, Discipline
of Action. So here, the knowledge how to perform an action is
‘Jnana’, and equanimity in success and failure is, ""Vijhana’.

, _ Action, thought and trance, performed respectively with

the physical, subtle and causal body, for one's own self, is not
knowledge (Jiiana), because it and its fruits have a beginning
and an end. But himself being a fragment of God, is eternal.
So, how can the transient and insentient, satisfy the eternal and
sentient? This knowledge, that actions and their fruits cannot
satisfy his own self, is knowledge (Jiana). By having this
knowledge, when a person remains equanimous in success and
failure, that is called ""Vijfiana’. He himself gets satisfied with
‘Jnana’ and 'Vijiana'. Thus for him nothing remains to be done,
to be known and to be achieved.

'Kiitasthah’'—'Kuta’, is a block of iron on which things made
of iron, silver and gold etc., are hammered into different shapes,
by smiths, but it remains the same. Similarly, the self-disciplined

'Vijitendriyah'—A striver, following the Discipline of Action,
has to conquer the senses, because while performing actions, he
may have attachment and aversion. Therefore, Lord Krsna in 12/11 OB
has said, ‘Subduing your mind, senses etc., relinquish the fruit
of all actions.’ It means, that in abandoning the fruit of action,
senses have to be subdued. Thus a striver who, while following
the spiritual discipline remains careful in subduing his senses,
his senses, are finally conquered when he realizes God.
‘Samalostasmakaficanah'—To a Yogi, a clod, a stone and
a piece of gold, are the same. In dealings, he knows the value _
of each one of them. So, he keeps gold.in the shelf, while lets
a clod and a stone, lie outside. But he remains equanimous, in
gain and loss. He views all the things of the world, with an
equal eye, because he knows that all of these, are transient. He 7
remains established in God, Who pervades everywhere equally, ;
and His axiomatic equanimity, abides in him. | -
'Yukta ityucyate yogi'—Such a Karmayogi, satisfied with
‘Jnana’ (knowledge), and 'Vijnana’ (equanimity), unshaken in all oe
circumstances, with senses subdued, and equanimous, is spoken
of as a Yogi viz., one who has attained Yoga or equanimity.

He, who regards well-wishers, friends, foes, neutrals, mediators,
the hateful, the relatives, saints and sinners, all alike, stands out
supreme. 9
Comment:—
[In the eighth verse, there is description of equanimity in
"
751,"714 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
objects, while here there is description of equanimity, in persons.
The objects, cannot perform any action, while persons perform
actions for themselves as also, for others.-So, it is difficult for .
them. to have equanimity in them. Therefore, the person who =
has a benevolent and impartial, attitude to all and regards them
alike, even after noticing differences, in their conduct stands
out supreme. ] .
‘Suhrnmitraryudasinamadhyasthadvesyabandhusu'—-One, who
is engrossed in the welfare of others, like a mother, without any
selfish motive, is called 'Suhrd' (disinterested friend), while one
who returns good for good, is a friend.
The foe, is he who does evil to others without any cause,
but the hateful is one, who does evil to others, having some
selfish motive or any other cause. — | -
The neutral, is he who remains indifferent, to two groups or
men, if they are fighting and the mediator, is one who desires -
compromise, for the welfare of both. -
He has a benevolent and impartial attitude, towards his
relatives, as well as those hostile, to him. -
'Sadhusvapi ca papesu samabuddhirvisisyate'—His dealing,
with saints and sinners, is different but he thinks about the
welfare of both of them, and also does good to them equally,
because according to him all persons, are different manifestations
of the same Divinity. As the Lord, is a disinterested friend, of
all beings (Gita 5/29), the Yogi is also a disinterested friend, of
all beings, (Srimadbhagavata 3/25/21).
Here, Lord Krsna, by using the phrase 'Sadhusvapi ca papesu’,
means that if he regards saints and sinners alike, he will regard
all people alike, because men are judged by their actions. The
Lord, also lays emphasis on conduct (actions), by declaring,
""Whatever a great man does, the same is done by others""
(Gita 3/21). If he regards men who perform virtuous actions,
"
752,"Verse 9] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 715
and also those who perform evil actions alike, it means, that
he stands supreme, because it is difficult to have a benign and
equanimous attitude for the sinners.
In the world, people generally have a tendency to observe
actions of others. By doing so, they cannot observe their real
self, that remains the same, while actions always undergo
changes. Secondly, they specially observe, evil actions of others
which mislead observers to degradation, because, by doing so,
they attach much importance, to those evil actions. Therefore,
Lord Krsna in this verse, has explained that a Yogi regards
saints and sinners alike, because he believes that God alone,
creates the phenomenon and so, all that is God. Thus, the Yogi
stands supreme.
;
According to the gospel of Gita, ‘Equanimity is called ;
‘Yoga’ (2/48). One who attains equanimity does not need any :
other virtue, for God-realization. He becomes wholly virtuous
spontaneously, and he conquers the mortal plane (5/19). In Visnu _
Purana, Prahlada has said, that equanimity is God's adoration
(1/17/90). We can attain, such a significant equanimity, by
being free from evil. The means to be free from evils, are (1) Do
not regard anyone as evil. (ii) Do not do any harm to anyone.
(1) Do not think ill of anyone. (iv) Do not perceive evils in
others. (v) Do not hear evil of others. (vi) Do not speak ill, of
others. By following these six rules, we shall be free from evil.
As soon as, we are free from evil, we shall become virtuous,
because virtue is our real nature.
We make efforts, and follow the spiritual discipline, in order
to, become virtuous. But, we do not become virtuous, because |
we do not renounce evil, altogether and even a fragment of an
evil, arouses pride of having virtue, which leads us to several
other evils. But when evil are rooted out, we become virtuous,
"
753,"716 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
spontaneously. When we become virtuous, we automatically,

do good to others. By doing so, all the world provides us the
necessities of life, without our asking and without working hard.
Thus, we cease our dependence, on the world. This freedom —
from dependence, on the world, enables us to attain equanimity,
which is axiomatic and then we have nothing to do, we become
liberated souls. .

Appendix—The sphere of evenness (equanimity) is different
from that of unequality. God is equanimous (equal) and the world _
is uneven. An enlightened Karmayogi remains equanimous, even
having different dealings with different persons. He regards a
clod, a stone, a piece of gold, a well-wisher, a friend, an enemy,

a neutral, a mediator, the hateful, a saint and a sinner alike,
though dealings with them can neither be the same, nor should
be the same and cannot be done the same. The reason is that __
he has realized, ‘there is. nothing else besides God’. _
- If there is an idol of Lord Visnu made of gold and there is -
toy-dog made of gold, both having the same weight will also
cost the same. Lord Visnu is the best and most venerable Deity __
while the dog is a mean and untouchable animal, in outward
dealings there is a vast difference between the two but as far
as the metal, gold is concerned, there is no difference between
the two. Similarly in the world there is outward diversity among
people as a friend, a foe, an exalted soul, a wicked person;
good, bad, gentle, vile, virtuous, sinful, righteous, immoral,
learned and foolish etc., but in essence all of them are only
the manifestation of God. Only God has revealed Himself in
different forms. He who knows this fact recognizes Him, others
don’t recognize Him.
- While bathing, when soap is applied to the body, if the
body is seen in a mirror, it looks bad and clumsy. At certain
parts, marks like blisters appear, somewhere lines appear. But
the person does not feel sad that he is suffering from a disease.
"
754,"Verse 10] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 717
The reason is that he knows that these marks will be rubbed
off when the body is washed in water. Similarly all beings are
the manifestations of God but outwardly they appear different -
because of difference in bodies and their nature. In fact in spite
of their different appearance, they are the manifestations of
God but it is because of our attachment and aversion that they
appear different. |
The fact which was mentioned in the second verse of the fifth
chapter by the expression ‘Karmayoga Visisyate’ (Karmayoga is
superior to Sankhyayoga), the same fact has been mentioned here
by the expression ‘samabuddhirvisisyate’. An equanimous person
remains untainted. Untaintedness leads to yoga while taintedness
leads to “‘bhoga’. There is equanimity in the three yogas but it
is specially important in Karmayoga, because Karmayoga being ~
the worldly spintual discipline, a Karmayogi faces more oddities .
in life than other yogis. ;

Link: —Equanimity (evenness of mind), which is attained -
by the Discipline of Action, is also attained by the Discipline
of Meditation. So Lord Krsna, while starting the subject of
meditation, gives inspiration for meditation.

A Dhyanayogi, should constantly engage in meditation, living
alone in seclusion, having subdued his mind and body, and having
got rid of bonds of desires and possessions for enjoyment. 10
Comment:—
[Here Lord Krsna is describing in detail, the Discipline of
Meditation, which was referred to in brief, in the twenty-seventh
"
755,"718 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
and twenty-eighth verses of the fifth chapter. Here, the word
""Yoga', which has been derived, from the root ""Yuj samadhau'
means, controlling the activities of the mind.]
‘Aparigrahah'—Meditation, is practised by disinclination for
the world, and inclination for God. For its practice, the first means
to be adopted, 1s 'Aparigrahah’. 'Aparigrahah' means freedom from
accumulation of possessions. Nothing, should be accumulated for
one's pleasures, because mind is attracted towards possessions
and pleasures, and so it cannot be engaged in meditation.
""Nirasih'—It means, that a striver should not be free from
outward prosperity and pleasures only, but also should get rid
of desires and hopes for prosperity and pleasures, because these
are all obstacles to God-realization. Therefore, a striver should
always be aware of these desires and hopes. |
'Yatacittatma'—Even, by renouncing pleasures and prosperity,
and also desire for them, there is possibility of attachment. -
Therefore, a striver should keep his body and mind under control. -
By controlling them, new attachment will not be aroused. The
means to control them, is that no action should be performed -
being attached to it, because attachment leads a body to laziness
and idleness, and senses, to pleasures, and mind, to the thought
of pleasures and futile thinking. |
""Yogi'—A Yogi, is one who is devoted to meditation,
- whose aim is only God-realization, rather than enjoyment and
accomplishment.
‘Ekaki'—A striver, should live alone, without any assistant,
because in company he is likely to be engaged in conversation.
In the absence of company because of attachment to him he
is likely to be haunted by that. Thus he will not be able to
meditate on God. |
'Rahasi sthitah'—A striver, should live in seclusion, on the
banks of a river, or in a forest, or a temple, or a lonely room,
meant for adoration and meditation only. The atmosphere, should
"
756,"Verse 10] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 719
be such, that there is no hindrance in meditation.

‘Atm4nam satatarn yufijita'—Thus a striver, living alone in
seclusion, as mentioned above, should concentrate his mind on -
God, with a firm determination to be engaged only, in meditation
without having the least thought, of worldly affairs, whatsoever _
might happen. He, should be on the alert, because alertness is
spiritual discipline.

A striver, should think of God, not only at the time of
meditation, but also while performing other actions, without
any attachment to these, because the thought of God, helps
in meditation, while the thought of God in meditation, helps a
striver in thinking of Him, during his mundane affairs. It means,
that a striver should always remember that he is a striver viz.,
he should always remember God, and think of Him, even when -
he performs worldly actions. He should harbour, no thought of
any worldly transaction, otherwise it will be a hindrance, in his :
meditation. Therefore, while sitting for meditation, he should :
have a firm resolve, that he has to meditate only on God,
whatever may happen. By this resolve, it will be easy for him -
to meditate on God.

A striver has a complaint, that he cannot concentrate his mind,
on God. The reason, is that he wants to concentrate his mind on
God, without breaking off his affinity, for the world. Therefore,

a striver should break off his affinity, for the world as it is this
affinity or attachment, or a sense of mine, which influences the
mind. Therefore, a striver can concentrate his mind and engage in
meditation, by only having the aim of God-realization and being
detached from all persons and things etc. If such detachment is
not there, these will haunt his memory. : |

Initially, Arjuna was prepared to wage the war and he also

got prepared at last. But, in between he thought that to wage
"
757,"720 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
war was a sin. Thus, it was a question, of performing an action
or not to perform it. So, it arose in the context of the Discipline
of Action. But how other disciplines, such as of Knowledge,
Devotion and Meditation were explained, in Gita. | - |
Arjuna retreats from the war, because he thinks that sin,
would. accrue to him, by killing his kinsmen. So he requests.
Lord Krsna, to tell him what was good for him (2/7; 3/2; 5/1).
Therefore, Lord Krsna explains to him, the different means
including gifts, rituals, penances, study of the Vedas and different
kinds of disciplines leading to God-realisation. But, in all the
means, Lord Krsna has emphasized the fact that the aim to attain
perishable things, is the main obstacle, to God-realization. If a
striver, has only the aim of God-realization, and performs actions
with equanimity those actions, would lead him to salvation or
God-realization. a -
Appendix—Karmayoga,* Jnanayoga and Bhaktiyoga are the
Karananirapeksa disciplines (independent of sense and other 7
organs) but Dhyanayoga (the Discipline of Meditation) is a
Karanasapeksa discipline (dependent on sense and other organs).
Now the Lord starts the description of Dhyanayoga. :

Having well arranged his seat (Asana) in a clean and unpolluted

place covered by KuSa-grass, a deer-skin and a cloth, one over the

other, neither too high, nor too low. 11 — ,

Comment:— oe

- ‘'Sucau dese'—The place, is pure in two ways—{(i) A naturally

pure place such as the bank of the Ganges, a forest and the place

near a holy basil, myrobalan (Arnvala), Pipala tree etc. (ii) Place

cleaned with cow-dung and by sprinkling water, or by removing

two inches of soil from the surface. A clean place of natural

beauty, invigorates and elevates the mind.
'CailajinakuSottaram'—According to the text a Kusa-grassmat,

a deer-skin, and a cloth, should be spread one over the other*

yet there should be spread a Kusa mat below, a deer-skin in |

the middle and a cloth at the top. The deer-skin should be of a -

deer, which is not killed, but which is dead, in the natural way,

as the skin of deer, which is killed is regarded, as impure. If a -

deer-skin, is not available, a rug can be spread. Over the rug, -

soft cotton cloth should be spread. KuSa-grass, is supposed to be

made from the hair of, boar-incarnation of the Lord and thus is ~

considered holy. Deer-skin is spread over a KuSa-grass mat, so

that Kusa-grass may not prick the skin and an electric current

of a body, may not pass through the KuSa-grass, to the earth, as

a deer-skin is a bad conductor, of electric current. A soft cotton

cloth is spread over the deer-skin, so that the bristles of deer-skin,

may not stick into the body and the striver feels comfortable.
‘Natyucchritam natinicam'—The seat of the plank-bed,

should neither be too high, nor too low, because if it is too

high, a striver while meditating may doze off, fall down and be

injured; but if it is too low, creeping insects, may disturb him

in his meditation. -
* The order of the text does not seem reasonable and proper because KuSa-

grass pricks the body. Therefore, it should be interpreted as a KuSa-grassmat

below, a deer-skin in the middle and a cloth at the top, because the order of the

meaning is more forceful than the order of the text.
"
759,"722 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
'Pratisthapya sthiramasanamatmanah'—The platform or the
plank-bed, should be fixed firmly. Moreover it should belong
to him and be used by him only, because there may be bacilli -
in it, of others, if it is used by them. Similarly, a striver should SO
have his own rosary, a bag for the rosary, and a spoon, used
in religious ceremonies etc. Not only this, but according to the
ordinance of scriptures, a striver should not use the seat, shoes
and shirts etc., of others, otherwise he has to be a sharer in their
virtues and sins. One should not sit, on the seat of saints and
ascetics because, it is a dishonour to them. If one touches their
seats and clothes etc., with feet, then it is also, a sin.

While seated on his seat, concentrating the mind and controlling
the thinking faculty (citta) and the senses, he should practise Yoga, 7
for self-purification. 12
Comment:— a
[After explaining the kind of a seat, now Lord Krsna, in
the twelfth and thirteenth verses, explains the process, how one
should practise meditation. ]
‘Tatra asane'—This phrase, has been used for the seat
with a KuSa-grassmat, a deer-skin and a cloth, described in the
previous verse. |
""Upavisya'—He should sit still on the seat, in a comfortable
posture, as 'Siddhasana’, 'Padmasana’ or ‘Sukh4sana’, etc., without |
moving the body. It is said, about the posture that a striver
should be able to sit in that posture continuously for three hours,
without moving the body. By doing so, the mind and life-breath
"
760,"Verse 12] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 723
naturally become calm, and free from volatility. Volatility of mind,
does not allow the body to remain motionless. The motion of
the body and urge for action do not allow the mind, to remain _
steady and calm. Therefore, it is very essential that the body
should remain motionless.
'Yatacittendriyakriyah'—Whiule seated, the mind and the senses
should be kept under control. A striver should control his body,
senses and mind, even in practical life, otherwise they cannot be
controlled easily, while he meditates. It means, that he should
lead a regulated and disciplined life, as has also been pointed
out, in the sixteenth and seventeenth verses of this chapter.
‘Ekagrarh manah krtva'—While meditating, he should make
a firm resolve, that he has to engage himself only in meditation.
If however, worldly thoughts crop up, he should think, that it is -
time only for meditation and not for worldly thoughts. If time
passes in worldly thoughts, no useful purpose will be served, and 7
he will be a loser, both ways. Thus, he should concentrate his -
mind, on God, without having any thought of mundane affairs.
Even then, if a worldly thought comes to the mind, he should -
neither support it nor oppose it. By doing so, the thought will
disappear as it is transitory. The thought, affects him, only if
he accepts his affinity with it, but if he remains indifferent to it
will automatically perish, because it is perishable and transient.
In the world, there are good and bad actions. If we do not have
any affinity with them, they would not affect us. Similarly during
meditation, if we do not have any affinity, with thoughts, our
mind will not get tainted. It will remain calm and composed.
'Yufijyadyogamatmavisuddhaye'—One should practise the
Yoga of meditation for self-purification. Desire for worldly things,
pleasures, honour, praise, name and fame etc., is impurity of the
self, and by renouncing all the desires, to have the only aim of
God-realization, is self-purification. : :
Yoga, is a power which can be used either for accomplishing
"
761,"724 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6

worldly pleasures, or for God-realization. If it is used ‘for worldly

accomplishments, it cannot be helpful in self-purification or

God-realization. But if it is used for God-realization, it will be

conducive to God-realization. | : Te

sampreksya nasikagram svam disaScanavalokayan

Let him hold the trunk, head and neck straight and steady,
gazing at the tip of his nose, without looking around. 13
Comment:—

‘Samam kayasirogrivarn dharayannacalam'—The portion of -
the body from the neck to waist, is called ‘Kaya’ (trunk), while ;
the portion from neck to top is called, head. All postures are -
useful, from meditation and health point of view. Out of those
postures, Lord Krsna has taken the essential feature, necessary
for meditation, 1.e., to keep neck, back and head in a straight -
position. While meditating, the trunk, head and neck should be
held straight, so that the spinal cord may remain vertical. In this
posture, the mind becomes calm and concentrated quickly. If one
bends forward, he feels drowsy, if he bends backward, there is
stupor and if he bends sideways, he becomes capricious. If he
feels drowsy, he should walk a little, and then again with a firm
determination, should repractise meditation by holding the trunk,
head and neck straight.

'DisaScanavalokayan'—-He should not look in any direction,
because by looking here and there, the neck will bend, which will
disturb his meditation. So the neck should be held straight.

'Sampreksya nasikagramm svam'—He should look at the tip
of his nose, with his half-closed eyes. If he closes his eyes, he
"
762,"Verse 14] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 725

may feel sleepy. But if the eyes are open, he is likely to look

at the other objects within sight and so there may be distraction

in meditation. Thus, Lord Krsna means to say, that he should ee
keep his eyes half-closed, because by doing so, the eye-balls

assume steadiness and seem as if they are looking at the tip of

the nose.

‘Sthirah’'—He should sit steady, without any activity of the
body or senses, just like a statue continuously for three hours.
Moreover, there should not be any activity of the mind also. By
doing so, he will overcome the strain of the posture and will
become ‘Jitasana’ (conqueror of the posture).

Appendix—Here gazing at the tip of the nose is not important
but concentration of the mind is important.

Link:—Blissful meditation (Yoga) on God, (endowed with -
attributes and form) and the good flowing out of it, have been -
explained, in the next two verses.

Serene and fearless, firm in the vow of celibacy, with mind
controlled, the vigilant Yogi should sit meditating on Me and having
Me alone, as the Supreme Goal. 14
Comment:—

'Prasantatma'—Serene-minded, is he who is free from
attachment and aversion. Attachment and aversion of the striver,
whose aim is only God-realization, without having any worldly
desire, (by becoming languid) perish, and with the disappearance
of attachment and aversion, a striver attains peace, which is
spontaneous. It means, that attachment and aversion, born of
"
763,"726 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
the affinity for the world, disturb serenity or peace. One, who
attains this peace, is serene-minded. | a
""Vigatabhih'—Fear of disease, censure, dishonour and |
death arise, only because man accepts the affinity of 'T'ness and
Mineness, with the body. But when he abandons this affinity, he
becomes free from all fears, because he thinks that even if the
body perishes, it will make no difference as his mind dedicated
to God, he will attain salvation, the ultimate goal of life.
""Brahmacirivrate sthitah'—Here, it does not mean only vow
of continence, but also includes that a celibate should lead a
disciplined and controlled life, according to the order of his
preceptor, free from sensual pleasures, honour, praise and comforts
etc. He should not in the least, enjoy worldly things in any state,
under any circumstance, either during meditation, or in practical
life, but use them only as necessities of life. -
‘Manah samyamya maccittah’'—Having controlled the mind _ -
of all worldly affairs, he should think of God's form, play, -
virtues, glory and excellence etc. It means, that by shutting out
all worldly thoughts, he should devote his mind to God only. _
The thoughts that come to mind, are either of the past or the
present. So he should neglect them, by thinking that these have
no existence at present. Moreover, the world actually does not
exist, 1t merely seems to exist, while God existed in the past,
exists now and will also exist, in future. So, he should think of _
Him, instead of thinking about the world.
""Yuktah'—He should remain vigilant, in diverting his mind
from worldly affairs and concentrate it on God, even while engaged
in worldly affairs, because vigilance during engagement in worldly
affairs, will help him in meditation, and that awareness during
meditation will be helpful to him, in his practical life.
'Asita matparah'—While sitting, he should have the only aim
of God-realization, without having any other desire, or lust or
attachment or mineness, in the least, as has also been pointed
"
764,"Verse 15} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 727
out, in the tenth verse of this chapter.
Appendix—To consider any special trait as one’s own is to
invite demoniac nature in oneself. Therefore the Lord by the SO
term ‘matparah’ mentions that the striver following the path of
meditation should depend on Him. By depending on God, evils
(flaws) are quickly removed and the striver is not proud of his
speciality. This is the special trait of devotion.
In this verse ‘mana’ and ‘citta’—these are two terms which
are synonyms have been used. With ‘mana’ anything is reflected
upon time and again and with ‘citta’ only one thing is thought
of. Therefore here the expression ‘manah satnyamya maccitah’
means that the world should not be reflected upon viz., detach
‘mana’ from the world and with ‘citta’ he should think of God
viz., concentrate ‘citta’ on God. _

Thus, constantly meditating on Me, the Yogi of controlled

Comment:—
""Yogi niyatamanasah'—One, who has controlled his mind is
called ‘'Niyatamanasah’. A Yogi's mind, can be subdued, only if
his exclusive aim is God-realization, without having any affinity
for the world. Affinity for the world, does not allow the mind
to be subdued.
A striver commits an error, if he thinks that he is a
householder, having some caste, creed and colour etc. Thus
he cannot meditate. A striver, should think that he is a striver,
"
765,"728 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
whose only aim is to meditate on God. His aim is not to attain,
mystic power. Thus, by changing his ‘I'ness, he will be able to
concentrate his mind, on God. With the change of 'T’ sense, the - = — |
inner sense would automatically change. |
- Yuiijannevarh sadatmanam'—The word 'Evam’ (thus), has

been used for meditation and concentration of mind, described
from the tenth to the fourteenth verses.

""Yunjan atmanam’ means, that a striver should concentrate
his mind on God, diverting it from the world. 'Sada' means that
he should practise meditation regularly, in seclusion and daily
life, always having the aim of God-realization. Such practice,
leads to an early success.

'Santim nirvanaparamam matsamsthamadhigacchati'—This
is a state, when established, nothing further remains to be |
attained. This state, is called Supreme-Peace or Supreme-Bliss  _
‘or emancipation or salvation. A striver, attains peace by breaking _
off affinity with the world, while he attains Supreme-Peace, by
attaining God-realization. The process of meditation, culminates
in 'Nirvikalpa sthiti', (state of mind where there is absence of _
all thoughts). But, this is also a state, as it does not remain
constant, as there is deviation from it, at times. This is not
God-realization. Further to it, there is 'Nirvikalpa bodha’, which
is Self-realization (God-realization). This is called Supreme-
Peace. The same Supreme-Peace (in 5/12) has been called,
'‘Naisthikim Santim' (final peace) and (in 9/31) 'Sa$vacchanti'
(Eternal Peace). |

natyasnatastu. yogo'sti na caikantamanasnatah
na cati svapnaSilasya jagrato naiva carjuna
Yoga is not successful for him who eats too much, nor for ~
one, who does not eat at all; or for him who sleeps too much, nor
too little. 16 .
Comment:—
'NatyaSnatastu yogo'sti'—Yoga is not possible, for him who
eats too much.* Too much eating, causes thirst for water. So he
has to drink much water. Too much water, makes the stomach
heavy and the body too. If he overeats, he becomes dull and
lazy, and may suffer from indigestion, which causes disease in
the body. So he cannot concentrate his mind, in adoration and
spiritual practice etc. So how can Yoga be possible for him? .
'Na caikantamanasnatah'—Yoga, is also not possible, for ~
him who eats too little. If he is underfed, he will feel hungry,
think of food again and again, and become weak. His body, will :
languish and life will become hard to live. He will be inclined to ;
keep lying down. It will be hard, to sit for meditation. Thus he
cannot concentrate his mind, on God. So how is Yoga possible -
for him?
""Na cati svapnasilasya'—Oversleep, makes a striver idle,
lazy and inert. In oversleep, the striver cannot sleep soundly,
and so different thoughts come to the mind. Thus, oversleep is
a hindrance to the practice of meditation. | |
‘Jagrato naiva carjuna'—This Yoga is not possible for him,
who sleeps too little. By keeping aware he feels drowsy, and
cannot practise meditation. |
Men, of sattvika disposition, while having spiritual discussions,
narrating and listening to lives of saints, devotees and incarnations
of God, have so much joy and get so much engrossed in them,
that they do not feel drowsy, at all even by remaining awake,
*If a person's food is less than that of others but is more than his appetite,
it is known as too much.
"

throughout a night. This wakefulness helps them reach a state,
which transcends the three modes of. Nature (prakrti).

Similarly, devotees in adoration, loud chanting and constant — —. ~~... ~
remembrance of God, are so much engrossed, that they do not
feel hungry. This cannot be said as 'not eating’ (3t19d:) because
all doings by men while devoted to God, become ‘Sat’.

yuktaharaviharasya yuktacestasya karmasu

yuktasvapnavabodhasya yogo bhavati duhkhaha

Yoga which brings out the cessation of the travails of the world _
is accomplished only by him, who is moderate in diet and recreation,
temperate in action and regulated in sleep, and wakefulness. 17 _
Comment:—_ . | -

""Yuktaharaviharasya'—Food (livelihood) should be earned,
by honest means, it should be pure, easily digestible, light, a -
bit less than necessary and items of food must be in accordance
with, the ordinance of scriptures and Ayurveda. Recreation, such
as physical exercise and walking etc., should be resorted to,
moderately.

""Yuktacestasya karmasu'—All actions, should be performed,
according to one's caste, creed, country, condition and capacity,
following the ordinance of the scriptures, and happily for the
welfare of others. , :

""Yuktasvapnavabodhasya'—One, should be moderate in sleep.

He should remain awake in the day, go to bed early at night,
and rise early in the morning. Here, the term 'Avabodhasya’,
(wakefulness) has a special meaning, that a striver should be
spiritually aroused, as this human life has been bestowed upon
him, to attain salvation. The term ""Yukta’ (moderate), means, that
"
768,"Verse 17] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 731
similar rules do not apply to all the persons for diet, recreations,
actions, sleep and wakefulness. But, everyone should be moderate
in them, according to circumstances he is in. -
'Yogo bhavati duhkhaha'—Thus, the Yoga of a Yogi, who ©
is moderate in diet, recreation etc., brings about a cessation of
the toil and troubles of the world.
There is an exceptional difference between, yoga (meditation)
and bhoga (pleasure). In 'yoga’ there is abnegation of ‘bhoga’.
In 'bhoga' there is not total negation of ‘yoga’. In 'bhoga’, what
happiness a man derives, is a result of disconnection of the contact
with the unreal. But, man does not pay attention to this fact, and
thinks that there is pleasure in contact, with worldly things. So,
he gets attached to sense-objects. He cannot experience yoga,
which brings about the cessation of miseries, of the world. In | ~
this Yoga, there is total negation, of worldly enjoyment. oO
|
This verse on meditation, is useful for all strivers. By following
it, they may attain salvation. There are, four factors described in 7
it—(1) moderate in diet and recreation, (2) moderate in action,
(3) moderate in sleep and (4) moderate in wakefulness.
We have twenty-four hours, at our disposal. If twenty-four
hours are divided say into four parts, we get six hours for each of
the above activities (1) six hours for eating, recreation and physical
exercise etc., (ii) six hours for actions for earning livelihood viz.,
farming, business and service etc., (iii) six hours for sleep and _
(iv) six hours for wakefulness viz., meditation; adoration, constant
remembrance and loud chanting etc., for God-realization.
These can also be divided into two parts (i) Income and
(11) Expenditure. Actions and wakefulness, ‘are the means of
income, while eating, recreation and sleep involve expenditure.
For income and expenditure, we have two kinds of capital—(i)
worldly riches (capital) and (ii) age.

recreation earning (spiritual
a livelihood discipline)

Let us first think about worldly capital (worldly riches). If
a person ears more, it is alright, but if his expenses are more
than income, it will not be good, it will ruin him. If a person,
devotes only four hours to eating and recreation etc., he may
devote eight hours to his profession, earning his livelihood.

Now, let us think about age. If he gets refreshed by four hours' ~—
sleep, he should devote eight hours to worship, meditation and
spiritual discipline. This spiritual discipline, should be enhanced -
everyday because we have come to be born for God-realization,
not for accumulation of mundane wealth etc.

Secondly; we should remember God, while earning our —
livelihood and also, while we go to bed. At bed time, a striver
should think that he has to devote time to devotion and adoration,
while lying in the bed. While lying down if he sleeps, it is alright
but he should not aim at sleeping. Again, when he wakes after
sleep, he should be engaged in adoration, meditation, devotion
and study of scriptures etc. While discharging his duty, or
performing actions, he should always remember, God. Thus each
and every activity of his life would become part and parcel of
one's worship. |

Appendix—The verses sixteen and seventeen are certainly
useful for the strivers following the path of meditation but they
are also very useful for strivers following other paths. |

yada viniyatam cittamatmanyevavatisthate

nihsprhah sarvakamebhyo yukta ityucyate tada

When the perfectly controlled mind is fixed on the self (Atman)
alone, free from desires for enjoyments, then the person is said to
be, an achiever of Yoga. 18
Comment:— |

[In this chapter, from the tenth to the thirteenth verses, there
is description of the seat and posture suited to meditation. In -
fourteenth and fifteenth verses, there is description of meditation -
on God (with attributes and form), with its fruit. In, sixteenth and
seventeenth verses, there is mention of regulations for all strivers -
of meditation. In the verses, from the eighteenth to the twenty-
third, there is description of meditation of the self with its result.]

""Yada viniyatam cittamatmanyevavatisthate'—'When a well
disciplined mind,* free from the thought of the world, gets
established in the self, whichever remains the same, without
any modification.’ In the self, there is enjoyment or bliss which
does not, let the mind deviate from it and thus the mind by
having this relish, gets engrossed in it. |

* The five stages of the mind are—'Mudha’, 'Ksipta’, 'Viksipta’ (confused),

‘Ekagra' (concentrated) and 'Niruddha’ (tied up). In the first two stages a striver
is not entitled for Yoga. The person with a Viksipta (confused) mind is entitled
for Yoga, his mind sometimes rests but sometimes does not rest in the self. When
the mind is concentrated, that is called ‘Savikalpa samadhi’. But the next stage is
when the mind is completely settled then that is called 'Nirvikalpa samadhi’ or
Yoga. Here in 'Viniyatarh cittam' as well as in the fifteenth verse of this chapter,
there is the hint of ‘Savikalpa samadhyr’.
"
771,"734 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 6
""Nihsprhah sarvakamebhyo yukta ityucyate tada'—When one
is completely free, from desires for all objects and pleasures,
here, as well as hereafter, he 1s called a Yogi. Se
The terms 'yada' (when) and ‘tada’ (then), denote that as soon
as, a person with disciplined mind, rests in the self alone, free
from desires for enjoyments, he becomes a Yogi.
In this verse, there are two important aspects—one is, that
the mind should rest in the self, and the other is, that it should
be free from desires, for all objects etc. It means, that when
the mind gets focussed in self, it does not think of any objects,
persons or circumstances etc., as it gets engrossed in the self.
Similarly, if mind rests in the self, the Yogi, becomes completely -
free from all desires, lust and aspiration, etc. Not only this but
he has no desire, even to have the bare necessities of life, and -
then he is a yogi, in the true sense of the term. 7
The same state, has been hinted at, in the fourth verse of this
chapter, for a Karmayogi, when the Lord declares, ""When a man -
ceases, to have attachment for sense-objects, or for actions and
_ renounces all thoughts of the world, he is said to have attained,
Yoga (6/4). The difference is, that a Karmayog! performs actions,
for others only. So, he gets totally detached, from actions and
objects. Then, he attains Yoga. A Dhyanayog! concentrates his
mind on the self, and when the mind gets established in the
self, he has no desire for actions and objects, not even, for the
bare necessities of life. It means, that a Karmayogr's desires, are
first wiped out and then he attains Yoga, while a Dhyanayogi's
mind, first gets established in the self, and then his desires are
wiped out. Thus, a Karmayogi applies his mind to the service
of the world and gets established in the self, while along with
the mind Dhyanayogi himself gets established in the self.

- yathaé dipo nivatastho nenhgate sopama smrta

‘As a lamp in a windless place, does not flicker’, this is the
simile used to describe the disciplined mind of a Yogi, practising
meditation, on the Self. 19
Comment:— |
'Yatha dipo nivatastho nengate sopama smrta, yogino
yatacittasya yuiijato yogamatmanah'—As a flame of a lamp, in
a place perfectly sheltered against wind, does not flicker, but
remains steady, in the same way when the mind of a striver,
rests in the Self alone, it becomes free, from all desires. -
The Yogi, who has subdued his mind, is called ""Yatacittasya’. -
In the preceding verse, such controlled mind has been described -
as 'Viniyata’. a
There is no place without wind, which exists everywhere. _
Somewhere, it is in its active form, while at other places, it is
inactive. Here, the term 'Nivatasthah’, does not refer to total lack
of wind, it rather refers, to the absence of its active state. |
Now, a question may arise, why the mind has been compared,
to the flame of a lamp which may flicker, and not to a mountain
which neither flickers nor shakes. The answer is, that unlike a
mountain, the mind does flicker like a flame. It is very difficult,
to keep a flickering item steady. So, it has been compared to a
flame. Secondly, as there is light in a flame, there is awareness
of God, in the mind. Though, in sound sleep and a trance, there
is an equal forgetfulness, of the world, yet, in sound sleep mind
merges in ignorance, and so there is no awareness, of the self.
In a trance the mind remains conscious of the Self. Due to these
reasons, an illustration of the flame has been given, here. This
fact, has also been pointed out, in the twenty-seventh verse of

yatroparamate cittam niruddham  yogasevaya

yatra caivatmanatmanam paSsyannatmani tusyati

When the mind, disciplined by the practice of Yoga becomes
tranquil and when the Yogi beholding the Self (Atman) by his
Self, he is contented in the self. 20
Comment:—

""Yatroparamate cittam niruddham yogasevaya, yatra— -
caivatmanatmanam pasyannatmani tusyati'—The determination to -
practise meditation on the self is ""Dharana’, while the continuous
flow of the mind, towards the self, disregarding other thoughts, _
is called ‘Dhyana’ (meditation). Meditation, has three aspects,
the meditative, (one who meditates), the act of meditation and
the aim to be achieved viz., self. So long as, there is knowledge |
about the three, it is meditation. But, when the mind gets so
much engrossed, in the aim, that nothing remains except the aim,
that state is called 'Samadhi' (trance). This is called 'Sarhprajnata
samadhi’. After practising it for a long time, it changes into
‘Asamprajnata samadhi’. The distinction between the two, is that
in the former, consciousness of the trio, regarding by way of the
object and its name and the relation between the name and the
object of meditation, persists. But in the latter, only the object
of meditation remains, by becoming oblivious of the two. The
former, is also called ‘ekagra' (concentration of mind), while the
latter 'niruddha’ (tied up state). :

The ‘samadhi’ (trance), of 'niruddha’ state, (tied up state)
"
774,"Verse 20] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 737
is also of two types—'sabija' (with seed) and ‘nirbija’ (without
seed). In the former, because of subtle desire ‘Siddhiyan’,
(accomplishments) appear. These accomplishments, are in the Te
form of worldly riches, which are obstacles to God-realization
or Self-realization. Therefore, regarding these as meaningless,
a Yogi, becomes quite indifferent to them, and then he rises to
the height of 'Nirbija samadhi' (trance without seed), which in
this verse has been referred to as 'Niruddham'’ (tied up. state of
trance).
In meditation, while having disinclination for the mundane,
a striver gets joy or peace, which is far superior, to mundane
pleasures. This joy, enhances as a striver rises to the higher
states of trance, by practising meditation. While progressing he
reaches the stage of 'Nirbija samadhi’ (trance without seed). If -
he does not enjoy ever that state of joy, then he is satisfied in
the self by the self. a ;
‘Uparamate'’ (attains quietness) means, that mind, being
insentient cannot catch the self, which is sentient. So, it becomes
quiet and at that moment, a Yogi ceases all affinity for the -
mind. oe
‘Tusyati’ means, that he is not satisfied with anything, else,
except the self. | |
The gist, of this verse is, that a Yogi realizes the self in
him, by his own self, as the Self ever remains, the same. Our
affinity, with the world, is the only obstacle to realize it. When
by meditation the mind becomes tranquil a Yogi's affinity with
the mind, and the world, is renounced and he realizes, the Self
in his own self.
The aim of human life, can be achieved by, both the Discipline
of Meditation, as well as the Discipline of Action. But, there is
a little difference between the two. In meditation, when the mind
"
775,"738 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
of a striver becomes peaceful, and does not enjoy the state of
trance, he is satisfied, in the self by the self. In the Discipline
of Action, when a striver abandons all desires of the mind, he mn nen
is satisfied in the self by the self (Gita 2/55). Se
In the Discipline of Meditation, when the mind is absorbed
in the Self, a Yogi experiences, trance. When he does not enjoy
that state, his affinity with the mind is broken off, and he is
satisfied in the self. :
In the Discipline of Action, when there is tendency of all
the actions, senses, mind, intellect and body etc., for the welfare
of others, all desires, are abandoned. As soon as, desires are
abandoned, the Yog?'s affinity, with the mind is broken off, and
he is satisfied in the self. : .
Appendix—The mind is not concentrated on the self, it can’t -
reach the self but it becomes indifferent. The reason is that the mind _
belongs to a different class from that of the self. The mind is lower _ |
(insentient) nature and the self is higher (sentient) nature. Therefore
the self rests in the self—‘atmanatmanam paSyannatmani tusyati’. -
‘Beholding the self by the self’ means that the self cannot
be perceived by senses but it can be perceived only by the self.
Whatever is thought of with the mind, that is only of sense- |
objects (the non-self), rather than of God. Whatever is determined
. With the intellect, is of the objects of the intellect, not of God.
Whatever is described with the tongue, is of the objects of the
tongue, not of God. It means that with the mind, intellect and
tongue there is reflection, determination and description which
are the evolutes of Prakrti (non-self). But God is realized by
having dissociation with the mind, intellect and tongue viz., by
renouncing affinity with them.*
* Tf thereis the only aim of God-realization, then reflection, determination and
description with the mind, intellect and tongue are not improper, but they became
the means to the end. But if a striver gets satisfied in them and thinks that he has
attained perfection, then that satiation becomes obstacle to his aim.
"
776,"Verse 21] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 739
Here the Self-realization which is attained by the Discipline
of meditation, the same is attained by Karmayoga (path of action)
(Gita 2/55). The difference is that ‘Dhyanayoga’ (Discipline of 7
Meditation) is dependent on instruments (Karanasapeksa) while
Karmayoga is a ‘Karananirapeksa’ (independent of instruments)
discipline. In ‘Karanasapeksa’ discipline, renunciation of affinity |
for Matter (non-self) is delayed and there is possibility of a -
striver’s deviation or downfall from Yoga. | :

vetti yatra na caivayam sthitascalati tattvatah _
When he feels that supreme and transcendental bliss while his
discrimination remains fully awakened, and wherein established, -
the said Yogi, never moves away from reality (tattva). 21
Comment:— |
'Sukhamiatyantikam yat'—The bliss which a Yogi feels, 1s
infinite and there cannot be any bliss greater than this because
it transcends the three attributes (modes) and is axiomatic. This
bliss, has been called an imperishable bliss (5/21), infinite bliss
(6/28) and absolute bliss (14/27).
This bliss, has been called infinite here, because, it is
superior to Sattvika joy, which is born of placidity of mind by
meditation, on God. This infinite bliss, is not born, but it is
unborn and axiomatic.
'Atindriyam'—This supreme bliss, transcends sensual pleasures.
It means, that it is superior to rajasika joy, which is derived
from the contact of senses with their objects. It is beyond our
"
777,"740 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
power, to obtain rajasika joy because it is beyond our power to
obtain individual's desired sense-objects. So, we are dependent
to obtain these, while there is no such dependence in attaining a
infinite bliss. That can be felt in the self by one's own self. In
attaining it you don't require any individual, any sense-object
and even your mind and senses. You are quite free in having
: it by your own self.
'‘Buddhigrahyam'—It means, that it is superior to the tamasika
joy, which arises from sleep, indolence and carelessness. A man
derives joy from sound sleep, but in sound sleep, his mind is
‘merged. Joy is also derived from indolence and heedlessness but
at that time mind is not awake and. discrimination is lost. But
in infinite bliss, the mind is not merged, nor is discrimination
lost. It is beyond the access of intellect, being an evolute of _
matter, while bliss, is the characteristic of the Self, which is
beyond matter. 7 -
Thus in this verse, it has been explained that the supreme ~
bliss, is far superior to the sattvika, rajasika and tamasika joy,
and it transcends all the three modes. | -
'Vetti yatra na caivayam sthitaScalati tattvatah'Y—A Yogi feels
bliss in his own self, and established there, he does not move
from reality viz., this bliss continues endlessly and spontaneously.
When, the muslims imprisoned Sivaji's son, Sarhnbhaj1, made him
blind and removed his skin off, to force him to embrace their
religion, but he did not do so and thus he did not go astray and
discard his religion. It means, that nothing can force a person
to move away from his beliefs. When no force, makes a person
to change his beliefs, how can anyone force a Yogi to deviate
from supreme bliss, or how can he himself abandon that supreme
bliss? He cannot.
It means, that a man never moves from Supreme Bliss,
because it is a characteristic of the Self (Soul). He changes only,
when there is the least affinity with matter. Thus, by affinity for
"
778,"Verse 21] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 741
matter, a man may have a fall, even from a trance. So long as,
he has affinity for matter, his self cannot merge, in the Cosmic
Self, because matter is always active. oo

Appendix—Having realized the self, a Dhyanayogi feels
imperishable and integral bliss which is atyantika (infinite) —
(supreme) viz., it is superior to Sattvika joy; ‘atindriyam’ viz.,
it is superior to Rajasika joy and ‘buddhigrahya’ viz., it is
superior to Tamasika joy.

When the Lord declares the imperishable bliss as
‘buddhigrahya’ He does not mean that it can be intuited (attained)
by intellect. The reason is that intellect is the evolute of Prakrti,
then how can it have an access to the bliss which transcends
Prakrti? Therefore the purpose in declaring it as ‘buddhigrahya’
is that it is superior to Tamasa joy. The joy, which is derived -
from sleep, indolence and carelessness, is Tamasa (Gita 18/39).
In sound sleep intellect merges in ignorance; and in indolence ;
and heedlessness, intellect does not remain fully awake. But -
in self-evident imperishable bliss, intellect does not merge in
ignorance but remains fully awake—jfanadipite’ (Gita 4/27). -
Therefore it has been called ‘buddhigrahya’ because intellect
remains awake but intellect has no access to it.

As in a mirror there is reflection of the sun, the sun is not —_
there, similarly in the intellect there is reflection of that bliss,
the bliss is not there; therefore it is called ‘buddhigrahya’.

It means that the integral bliss is far superior to Sattvika,
Rajasa and Tamasa joy, it transcends them. In spite of being
called as ‘buddhigrahya’, it totally transcends intellect.

The self associated with the intellect (Prakrti) is ‘buddhi-
grahya’, not the pure Self. In fact the self cannot be attached to
Prakrti but he (self) assumes his attachment to Prakrti—‘yayedarh
dharyate jagat’ (Gita 7/5). |

And, having gained which state he does not reckon any other
gain greater than that, and wherein established, he is not shaken
even by the greatest affliction. 22 :
Comment:—
""Yam labdhva caparam labham manyate nadhikam tatah'—
When a person, expects more happiness in something else, than
what he possesses, there is every possibility of his reverting -
to that. A man, wants to attain Supreme Bliss, or infinite |
bliss, and he runs after sleep, indolence and heedlessness, the -
*  tamasika joys. But he abandons these, because he feels that the
joy derived from the contact of the senses with their objects
is more pleasant than this one. He abandons it, also when he -
feels that Sattvika joy which is born by placidity of mind, by
meditation on God, is superior to it. He abandons it too, when
he feels, the Supreme Bliss. There is no greater bliss than this.
By gaining this, he has nothing else to seek, because there is
no gain, greater than this. ~
""Yasminsthito na duhkhena gurunapi vicalyate'—A man, may
also abandon something, if it results in affliction in spite of its
gain. A man, may abandon an attempt to achieve a goal, if he
feels that there is some danger. But here Lord Krsna, says that
a Yogi having been established in the Supreme Bliss, cannot
be shaken even by the greatest suffering. If he is hanged or his
limbs are broken to pieces, or his body, is ground to powder
between mill-stones or his skin is stripped off his body, or, his
body is put into boiling oil, yet he is not shaken.
"
780,"Verse 23] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 743
_ Why is he not shaken even by the greatest punishment? The
reason, is that a Yogi established in the Supreme Bliss, has no
body consciousness. So the harm inflicted on the body, does mn
not affect him. He feels pain or affliction, only if he identifies
himself with matter (Gita 13/21). But, when he by breaking off
his affinity, with matter, is established in the Supreme Bliss, of
the self, afflictions or sufferings cannot have any access to him,
and so he is not shaken even by the heaviest suffering. ,
Appendix—tThis verse is the touchstone for all disciplines.
A striver following any discipline—Karmayoga, Jnanayoga,
Dhyanayoga and Bhaktiyoga etc., should test himself on this
touchstone. In order to know his state this verse is very useful for
a Striver. Every being has an aim to wipe out sufferings and to
attain bliss. Therefore every striver should attain the state described -
in this verse. If this state has not been attained, it means that
his spiritual discipline has not attained perfection. A striver may :
not discontinue his practice or he may regard his imperfection -
as perfection, so this verse should be the criterion. )

A man can attain such a rare state—in which there 1s endless -
gain and there is not an iota of suffering but by indulging in |
accumulation and enjoyments he causes limitless harm to
himself.

'Tam vidyadduhkhasamyogaviyogarm yogasaijiitam'— Our
union with pain and birth is the result of accepting our affinity
with the world, and this affinity is merely assumed not real. We
can be delinked from this union, because it is merely assumed,
and is not natural. However, strong, our assumption may be,
and it may be for a long time, we can cut it asunder, as it is
impermanent. As soon as, we are disconnected from this union,
with pain (body and world) we attain Yoga i.e., we feel our union
with the Self, which is constant, eternal and spontaneous. But we
forget this latter union, because of our accepting affinity, with
the world. By breaking off this affinity, our memory is revived. —
Therefore, Arjuna in the seventy-third verse of the eighteenth _
chapter, says that he has regained his memory. It means, that _
Arjuna has not gained anything new, but he has regained his
memory, that he has a constant union with God (Self).

Here in this verse, Lord Krsna has defined Yoga, as -
disconnection of union with pain, while in 2/48, he has defined
it as equanimity in pleasure and pain. In fact, both, the definitions
are one and the same, because equanimity in pleasure and pain,
turns into a state of separation from union, with pain.

Patafijali has defined Yoga, as the control of mind
(Yogadarsana 1/2) and when the mind is controlled, one rests
in the Self (1/3). But in the Gita, Lord Krsna has defined Yoga,
as in this verse, one’s union with the self, which is axiomatic.

The term 'tam' (that), has been used for a state of a Yogi of
disciplined mind. This state has been hinted at, by the term ‘Yatra’
(where), in the first half of the twentieth verse of this chapter,
where it has been mentioned that the mind attains quietude. In
the second half of the twentieth verse, where it is mentioned
that a Yogi gets established in the self. In the first line of the
"
782,"Verse 23] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 745
twenty-first verse, He explained the importance of supreme bliss,
by using the term 'yat’ (which), while in the second line, by using
the term 'Yatra' (where), He explained the state of a Yogi. In CS
the twenty-second verse, He explained gain by the term ‘Yam’
(which), and 'yasmin' (in which). Thus, Lord Krsna by using the
term 'Yat'*, six times from the twentieth verse to the twenty- |
second verse, has explained the singular state of a Yogi. The
same state, has been glorified here, by the term ‘tam’ (that).
'Sa niScayena yoktavyo yogo'nirvinnacetasa'—This Yoga of
meditation, should be practised by a striver, by having the aim
of attaining Yoga (equanimity) with determination and with an
undistracted mind, as has been described from the eighteenth
verse to the twentieth verse of this chapter. In order to, realize
this state of equanimity, a striver should have a fixed mind, -
that he has to attain Yoga (equanimity), even in the face of all
temptations and afflictions. | -
'‘Anirvinnacetasa’ means, that a striver should not feel
despondent and distracted in attaining that Yoga, in spite of
obstacles and afflictions. He should think, that he has to realize -
God, perfection or equanimity even if, he has to spend years
and births together, and even if he has to face most serious |
afflictions. He should think, that he has wasted innumerable
births and suffered tortures in hell, but has not attained his aim
of God-realization, though his past sins have been destroyed. So,
he should devote his full time (span of his present life), power
and resources to, realize Him.
Appendix—The division of worldly union viz., Sarnyoga is
different from that of Yoga. There is ‘Sarnyoga’ with that object
(or person) or action with which we can’t stay forever and which
can’t stay with us forever. There is “Yoga’ with that with whom
we can stay forever and who can stay with us forever. Therefore
in the world there is ‘Sarhyoga’ with one another and with God
**Yatra', ""Yam' and ‘Yasmin’ are the words formed from the word 'Yat’. |
"
783,"746 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 6
there is yoga. In fact there is no union with the world and no
disunion from God viz., whatever we gain in the world is not
permanent hence it is no gain at all and God is never separate == = ~~ = —
from us. The assumption of the union with the world and disunion
from God is ignorance and it is the greatest blunder of a man.
Certainly there is disunion from the worldly union but there is
no disconnection at all from the union with God. |

A man wants union (with worldly things) but he has to
face disunion, therefore the world is said to be the abode of
sorrows—duhkhalayamasasvatam’ (Gita 8/15). A desire leads to
the union with pain (sufferings). If a striver is free from desires,
there is no union with sufferings and there is union with God.

The union of an embodied being with God is eternal.
This axiomatic eternal union is called ‘Yoga’. This eternal -
union prevails in all places, all the time, in all actions, in all ;

| things, in all persons, in all states, in all circumstances and in -

all incidents. It means that there has neither been, nor is, nor
will be nor can be any disunion from this eternal union. But by
assuming connection with the unreal (body) the eternal union
is not realized. As soon as there is separation (renunciation of
connection) from the assumed union with the unreal in the form
of pain, the eternal union is realized. This is the chief Yoga of
the Gita and in order to realize this yoga there is description
of Karmayoga, Jnanayoga, Dhyanayoga and Bhaktiyoga etc.
But these disciplines (paths) will be called “Yoga’ only when
there is total renunciation of affinity with the unreal and there
is realization of eternal union with God.

The Lord has defined Yoga in two ways—

(1) Equanimity is called Yoga—‘samatvath yoga ucyate’
(Gita 2/48). | |

(i) Termination of union with pain in the shape of the
worldly transmigration (travails of worldly life)—‘tarh vidyad-
duhkhasamyogaviyogam yogasanjiiitam’ (Gita 6/23).
"
784,"Verse 23] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 747

Fither call it equanimity or call it disconnection of union
with pain in the form of the world—both are one and the same.
It means that by getting established in equanimity, there will be _
disunion from the union with the world, and by the disunion
of the union with the world, a striver will get established in
equanimity. By anyone of these two, the eternal union with God
will be realized. If we see from the subtle point of view that ‘tarn
vidyadduhkhasamnyogaviyogarm yogasaiijiiitam’ is the first stage |
and ‘samatvarh yoga ucyate’ is the later stage in which there is
attainment of ‘naisthikisanti’ (everlasting peace), ‘paramasanti’
(supreme peace) or ‘atyantika sukha’ (eternal bliss).

Equanimity is being attained naturally and sufferings are
also disappearing naturally. Only that is attained who is ever
attained and only that is renounced which is ever renounced. The _
attainment of the ever attained is called Yoga and renunciation
of the ever renounced is also called yoga. The pleasures that are -
derived from the contact with sense-objects, persons and actions -
are only sources of pain viz., they cause sufferings (Gita 5/22).
Therefore union with the world rather than disunion causes -
sufferings. There is no disunion of the joy (bliss) which is
attained by disunion (renunciation of affinity) from the world
because it is eternal. When there is disunion in both union and
also disunion, it means that disunion is eternal. This eternal
disunion is called ‘Yoga’ in the Gita.

God being ever-existent is called ‘Is’ and the world being
never really existent is called ‘Not’. A vital fact is that while
we try to perceive ‘Is’ then pure ‘Is’ is not perceived but if we
observe ‘Not’ as negation, pure ‘Is’ to intuited. The reason is
that while we perceive ‘Is’ we make such perception through the
mind, intellect and other such ‘Vrttis’ then ‘Is’ to be perceived.
‘Is’ associated with such ‘Vrttis’, but while we perceive ‘Not’
then our ‘Vrttis’ themselves being ‘Not’ will be also shunned
and pure ‘Is’ will be intuited. As while removing rubbish, the
"
785,"748 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
broom is also discarded after removing rubbish as it is also
rubbish and the (clean) house remains. It means that ‘God
pervades everywhere’—by reflecting upon it with the mind and ---...=-
by. determining it with intellect, our connection with “Vrtti’ will
persist. But ‘the world is separating from us every moment’—thus
by perceiving the world as non-existent, our affinity with the
. world and the “Vrtti’ will be renounced and pure Supreme Reality
(God) will remain.

Completely giving up all desires arising from thoughts of the -
world, and restraining the senses, from all sides, by the mind. 24
Comment:— | |
[The state, which is attained by disinterested action (6/1—9),
is attained by meditation on God with attributes and form (6/14-15),
as by meditation on the self (6/18—23), is also attained by
meditation on the Absolute, Who is formless and attributeless,
which is described here. ] :
‘Sankalpaprabhavankamamstyaktva sarvanaSesatah'— Thoughts
of worldly things, persons and incidents etc., come to the mind,
when the man is either attached to or hateful for these and, it
becomes a 'Sankalpa’ (pursuit of the mind). This seed of pursuit,
sprouts and grows into a plant of desire. It should happen and it
should not happen—this is desire. Thus desire born of thought,
should be completely abandoned. :
"
786,"Verse 25] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 749
The term 'Kaman' (desires), which is itself plural, yet to
emphasize that all the desires of different kinds, should be
abandoned another term 'Sarvan' has also been given here. Te
'Asesatah' means, that the seed of desires should be completely
destroyed, otherwise it may sprout and grow into a forest of
desires stretching for miles and miles.
'Manasaivendriyagramar viniyamya samantatah'—Objects of
five senses—sound, touch, colour, taste and smell, should be
fully restrained by the mind. ‘Samantatah' means, that the mind |
also should not think of sensual pleasures, and in the mind there
should not be any temptation for worldly praise, honour and
comfort etc., in the least. One, who practises meditation should
resolve, to renounce affinity for all material objects. -
Appendix—First there is ‘Sphurana’ (mere flash of thought)
and then it is changed into ‘Sankalpa’ (pursuit of the mind). -
When we take ‘Sphurana’ as existent and get attached to it and ~
further we insist on its implementation then it changes into a
‘Sankalpa’. ‘Sphurana’ is like the glass of a mirror in which no -
photograph of a man its taken but ‘Sankalpa’ is like the film of
a camera which immediately catches the impression.

be done, to give up all desires and to restrain the senses.

One's intellect (mind) fixed firmly, he should gradually attain

"
787,"750 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
Comment:—

'‘Buddhya dhrtigrhitaya'—A striver, should not feel dejected
and disappointed, that he has not been successful, in meditationon -
God, after practising for a long time. He should have patience and
determination, that he has to attain God, whatever may happen,*
because there is no gain better than this. Thus, he should control
his intellect, without caring for worldly pleasures, praise, honour
and comfort etc.

'Sanaih sanairuparamed'—In being indifferent, to worldly
pleasures, he should not make haste, but he should become
indifferent gradually, and finally achieve quietude. He should
have neither attachment nor aversion, for pursuits of the mind. If
we abandon a thing there is a possibility of a feeling of aversion
persisting for it but there should not remain even a trace of the -
feeling of aversion for any object of the world. It is said that we
should become indifferent to it. Here, attainment of an attitude of
indifference has also been mentioned, because God, the sentient -
is beyond the access of mind, being as evolute of matter; which
is insentient. As a lamp, which receives light from the sun cannot -
illumine the ‘sun, so mind, which receives energy from God,
cannot have access to Him but can be indifferent to the world.
Secondly, in the world, there is nothing but affliction, therefore,
it is futile to think of the world. So, one should become quiet,
tranquil and indifferent.

‘Atmasamstham manah krtva'—God pervades everywhere,
even in thoughts, so thoughts are nothing, except God, who is
their base and illuminator. Secondly, God is eternal and always
the same, without any modification, while persons, things and
circumstances etc., are born and they decay viz., and have
no existence. So fixing the mind on God, and having a firm

* He should have an iron determination that he will not leave his seat without
realizing God even though his body may get parched and even his skin, flesh and
bones may decay.
"
788,"Verse 25} _. SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 751
determination of the existence of God, alone he should not
think at all. , , Ce
‘Na kificidapi cintayet'—It has already been said, that he
should not think of the world. God is all-pervasive, he should
also not think so. By that, his affinity with the mind, will persist.
A meditator, and the mind, will have their existence, so having
resolved, that God pervades everywhere, he should not think
of anything else. Thus by becoming tranquil, he will realize
the ever-existent self which has already been described in the
twenty-second verse. |
The most important fact, is that God (manifest or unmanifest),
pervades everywhere—in all persons, things, incidents, -
circumstances and actions and there is never any modification .
in Him, while matter always undergoes modifications. As a diver _ .
dives, into an ocean and perceives water all-around, similarly, a
striver, should feel God all-around and also, in him. The only -
aim of mankind, 1s to realize God, Who is ever realizable,
but He is not felt, because we divert our attention towards
perishable things. |
_ Jf we had an exclusive devotion to attain Him, our mind
would be automatically concentrated, on Him. Ether is around
us and so is God, but we do not pay attention to it. Therefore, a
striver abandoning all thoughts of the world, should be indifferent
and quiet. He, while concentrating his mind on God, commits
an error, that he opposes a thought that comes to the mind, and
then has affinity for it. Similarly, he has affinity for a thought,
if he is attached to it. Therefore, a striver should neither oppose
any thought nor support it, he should only remain indifferent
and attain tranquillity or quietude. |
All projections and distractions of the mind, are transient,
so if these are born, they would decay, certainly. We should not
"
789,"752: SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
accept our affinity for them. We should accept our affinity for
God, who pervades everywhere. When, we confine ourselves
to a body, our separate entity, comes into existence that, 'T am’. a
This individuality is also encompassed by God, who is limitless,
even, tranquil and also truth, knowledge and bliss as well as, the
illuminator of all things and actions. All objects and actions are
illumined by one light. This light, has a relation either with all
objects, actions and persons, or with none. This light, remains
as it is. Similarly, God as light, has no relation with objects and
actions etc., these objects and actions are transitory, while the
: Lord is without origin. Being established in Him, one should

not think of anything.

One, 'Cintana' (thinking), is done, while the other is automatic.
We should not resort to it (thinking). If some thought crops us, -
we should remain neutral and indifferent. An ice-cube (block
of ice), dropped into water is water, and is also: surrounded by
water. Similarly, all projections and distractions are within God, -
and God is in them.

Moreover, when a striver meditates upon, the memory past -
incidents etc., comes to mind, which have no current existence.
But, a striver by accepting their existence, strengthens them. So,
he should remain indifferent to them, without having attachment
or aversion. for them. They will perish, in the same way as, they
are born. We have a constant affinity, with God, we are His,
and He is ours. So, a striver by accepting the fact, that he is
always established in Him, should sit quietly without thinking of
anything else. He should not accept his affinity with a thought,
that comes to his mind itself. By doing so, the thought will
perish, and he will be fixed in God, because he always remains
fixed on Him.

Waves rise in a sea, but in water there is neither, sea nor
waves. Similarly in God, there is neither world nor thoughts. Only
He pervades, equally everywhere. Clouds appear and disappear
"
790,"Verse 25] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 753
in the sky, but the sky remains, the same. Similarly, while
meditating, thoughts come to mind and slip away while God
who is everywhere, remains the same. God is all-around, inside Te
as well as, outside. Everything, sentient or insentient, animate or
inanimate, 1s God Himself. He is both at hand and far away. He
is incomprehensible, because of His subtlety (Gita 13/15). He
is All Truth, All Knowledge and All Bliss. Everywhere, there
is bliss, bliss and only bliss.
While, discharging duties and performing actions, we should
accept that God is all-pervading and undivided. It will help us in
meditating, on God, while meditation on God will be helpful to us
in our practical life, viz., in remembering Him, when we perform
our duties. Therefore, a striver while meditating in seclusion or
performing actions in society, should always accept that God -
pervades everywhere, in all, the time, persons, things, incidents
and actions etc. So, we should always remain established in :
Him, without thinking of anything else. -
Appendix—The Discipline of Meditation is of two types—
(i) to concentrate the mind (ii) to renounce affinity for the mind ~
by discrimination. Renunciation of affinity by using discrimination
immediately leads to salvation. In the world so many virtuous
and sinful actions are done but we have no connection with
them, similarly we have no connection with the body, senses,
mind and intellect. This is known as ‘uparati’ (indifference). We
should have no connection with the ‘Vrtti’. In ‘Srimadbhagavata’
is mentioned— |
sarvam brahmatmakam tasya vidyaya’tmamanisaya
paripasyannuparamet sarvato muktasarisayah
(11/29/18)
The devotee who follows the above-mentioned discipline
(worship of God with all actions of mind, tongue (speech) and
body) has the determination, “AI] is God”. Then by this spiritual
knowledge, being free from all kinds of doubts, perceiving God
"
791,"754 -SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
pervading everywhere, he should become ‘uparama’ (indifferent)
viz., “All is God’—even this should not be thought of but God
should be seen face to face. | | 7 Ro

God as in the form of eternal-existence pervades all places,
time, actions, objects, states, circumstances, incidents etc., equally.
Places and time etc., have no existence but God ever exists. So
first a striver should have the determination with the mind: and
intellect “God exists’. Then he should give up this determination
also and be quiet viz., he should think of nothing. He should
think neither of the self nor of non-self, nor of God, nor of the
world, nor of union, nor of disunion. If he thinks of anything,
the matter (inert) will be thought of. The reason is that if he
thinks of anything, ‘Citta’ (mind) will accompany him. If an
instrument (Citta) accompanies him, the world will not be :
renounced because an instrument is also a part of the world.
Therefore in ‘na kifcidapi cintayet’ there is disconnection from
‘Citta’ (the instrument) because when an instrument is not with ~ |
him, then there will be real meditation. Even in the most subtle
reflection, “Vrtti’ persists. But when there is no reflection, the -
‘Vritti’ disappears. Therefore a striver should be indifferent to
reflection even. As, the soil mixed with water slowly settles down
naturally when the water is still, similarly all evils (flaws) by
keeping quiet slowly calm down naturally, ego melts and the
real self (the Reality) (free from egoism) is realized. |

Here the terms ‘Sanaih Sanaih’ have been used for giving up
“Vrtti’. By using the words ‘Sanaih Sanaih’ the Lord means to
say that the striver in order to be indifferent, should not apply
force, should not make haste because the impression gathered
through life after life, are not wiped out hastily. Haste makes
volatility firm and permanent but ‘Sanaih Sanaih’ (gradual effort)
destroys volatility.

Without connection with Prakrti, there can’t be any ‘cintana’,
‘manana’ (reflection) etc. If a striver thinks of the Supreme Reality,
"
792,"Verse 25] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI : 755

the mind will be used; if he determines, intellect will be used;

if he sees, the eyes will be used; if he hears, the ears will be

used and if he says anything, the tongue will be used. Similarly -
if he assumes ‘Is’, then assumption and he who assumes will

persist, and if he negates ‘not’, he who negates will remain.

If he renounces the sense of doership, “I am not a doer’ this

subtle ego will persist viz., by renunciation, the thing renounced

and he who renounces will remain. Therefore a striver should

become ‘uparama’ (indifferent) viz., he should neither assume

nor negate nor receive nor renounce but should accept the self

evident and natural Divinity and become quiet from within and

from without. ‘I have to keep quiet’—this insistence (pursuit of

the mind) should also not be maintained, otherwise he will have

the sense of doership. ‘Quietude’ is self-evident or automatic (it -
requires no initiative).

A striver should give up these four—‘I’, ‘thou (you)’, ‘this’ |
and ‘that’, and then only ‘Is’ (Reality) remains. He should accept —_
that self-evident ‘Is’ and should not think of anything. If a
thought comes to the mind, he should have neither attachment -
nor aversion to it, he should neither be pleased nor displeased
with it, he should consider it neither good nor bad nor he should
accept it in him. He should not think of anything but if a thought
crops up, that is not harmful. Air blows, sometimes it is hot,
sometimes cold, it rains—we are not to be blamed for these
occurrences because we have no connection with them. We are
blamed if we are connected with matter. Therefore if any thought
crops up, be indifferent to it, don’t get mixed with it viz., we
should not hold, “I think or ‘thinking’ is done in me.” But we
should hold, “Thoughts come to the mind and I (self) have no
connection with the mind.”

In the expression “atmasamstham manah krtva’ the term
‘manah’ stands for intellect because volatility is the trait of
mind and steadfastness is the trait of intellect. Therefore the :
"
793,"756 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
term ‘atmasarnstham’ means that instead of volatility, there
should be steadfastness. As “This is a particular village’—when
this assumption becomes firm, we have not to think of it again |
and again, similarly ‘God exists’—if this assumption is firmly oe |
rooted, then we’ll have not to think of His existence repeatedly. .
Therefore whatever is self-evident, what is the need to think of
it? So by thinking of the self, the self is not realized because
by thinking of the self, the thinker remains and existence of the
non-self persists. When we assume the existence of the non-self,
then we’ll renounce the none-self and think of the self.

‘Na kincidapi cintayet’—this is also known as ‘Cupa Sadhana’,
‘muka satsanga’, and ‘acintya ka dhyana’. In it there is neither
‘an action’ through the physical body nor there is ‘thinking’
through the subtle body nor ‘constancy’ (trarice) through the
causal body. In it senses are inactive, mind is also composed, -
intellect is also silent viz., there is no activity of the body, senses,
mind and intellect. All are silent, no one speaks. Whatever was _
to be seen, has been seen; whatever was to be heard, has been
heard, whatever was to be spoken, has been spoken; and whatever
had to be done, has been done; now there is no interest (taste) -
in seeing, hearing, speaking and doing etc.,—in such a state
‘Cupa Sadhana’ (silent discipline) is practised. This discipline
is superior even to trance because in it affinity for intellect
and ego is renounced. In ‘samadhi’ (trance), ‘laya’, ‘viksepa’,
‘kasaya’ and ‘rasasvada’—these four flaws (obstacles) persist
but ‘Cupa Sadhana’ is free from these flaws. “‘Cupa Sadhana’
(silent discipline) is devoid of Vrtti.

By whatever cause, the restless and unsteady mind wanders away, —
he should restrain it and continually concentrate it, on God.* 26
Comment:—
'Yato yato niscarati manaScaficalamasthiram _tatastato |
niyamyaitadatmanyeva vasam nayet'—Mind does not remain
steady, in the aim fixed by a striver. So it is called unsteady. It
thinks of worldly pleasures, and objects so it is called, restless. It
means, that it neither is fixed on God, nor renounces the world.
Therefore, a striver should restrain the mind from worldly objects
and thoughts, with discrimination, and place safely it at the feet
of the Lord. He should be cautious in subduing the fickle and
unsteady mind. He should, not be lax in it. It means, that a striver -
should understand, that the base and illuminator of those objects
and thoughts, is only God. This is concentration on God. -
(i) A striver, should restrain the mind when it is diverted to -
persons, things and circumstances etc., and concentrate it, again
and again, on God.
(ii) All the beings and things, in this universe are manifestations
of God. So he should understand, that whatever thought comes
to his mind, is nothing but God. Thus, he should concentrate
his mind, on God.
(111i) Mental rubbish stored inside the mind begins to come
out at the time of meditation, because when one was busy with
other activities, it could not find an outlet. By thinking thus, a
striver should not be perturbed. He should, rather continue his
efforts to concentrate, his mind.
this verse.
"
795,"758 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA __ [Chapter 6
| (iv) A striver cannot meditate on God, because he meditates
on Him, by accepting himself as of the world, while really he
is God's. Therefore, he should accept the reality, ""I am only
God's, and only God is mine. I am not of the body and the
world, and the body and the world, are not mine."" By accepting
affinity for God, which is a reality the mind will automatically
- . be concentrated on Him. : :
| (v) A striver, should not leave any part of work, pending. He
Should, either do the work first, or remove its thought from his
mind, and then start meditation on God, with a calm mind.
a (vi) He should do away with all pursuits and distractions of
_.the mind, by offering these as an oblation to the fire-god.
| (vii) He should, wink his eyes several times and then shut
these. By winking, as the outward scene is cut off, so are the _
pursuits and distractions of the mind, eliminated.
| (viii) He should exhale air forcibly from his lungs two or three
times, and then hold his breath as long as he can. Then, he should =~
| Start breathing slowly and come to a natural state of breathing.
By doing so, pursuits and distractions of the mind, disappear.
_ Appendix—lIf according to the preceding verse, a striver may
- not practise silent discipline, then he should restrain the mind
from worldly objects and thoughts, and concentrate it on God.
_ An excellent means to fix the mind on God is that wherever
the mind wanders, there he should perceive (see) God and
| whatever thoughts come to the mind, they should be regarded
as the manifestation of God.
: There is a vital point that so long as a striver assumes any
_ Other entity besides God, his mind cannot be totally restrained.
The reason is that so long as we recognize any other entity,
attachment can’t be totally wiped out and without total destruction
of attachment, mind can’t be totally controlled. If attachment
. persists, mind can be restrained to a certain extent by which
worldly ‘siddhis’—-accomplishments are achieved but Divinity
"
796,"Verse 27] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 759
is not attained. If any other entity is assumed, then the mind is
controlled for sometime and then there is deviation viz., there
are two states—trance and relapse. The reason is that without -
assuming the other entity, two states are not possible. Therefore
the mind can be totally restrained by assuming that there is no
any other entity besides God.

upaiti Santarajasam brahmabhiitamakalmasam
Great sattvika happiness, truly comes to the Yogi, whose mind -
is calm, whose passions are subdued, and who is without sin. 27
Comment:— | | .
'Prasantamanasam hyenam yoginam sukhamuttamam, upaiti
Santarajasam brahmabhitamakalmasam'—' Akalmasam' (sinless),
is he, who is free from tamas disposition, such as obtuseness,
inactivity, heedlessness and delusion (14/13). _
'Santarajasam' (whose passions are subdued), is he, whose
rajas propensities, of greed, activity, undertaking of actions with a
selfish motive, restlessness and a thirst for enjoyment, are subdued.
‘Prasantamanasam’ (one of peaceful mind), is he, whose mind,
becomes calm because he renounces all tamasika and rajasika
passions, and is free from mundane pursuits and distractions.
Here, the term 'Prasanta' means, that a Yogi, does not accept the
mind as his own and so his mind, becomes free from attachment
and aversion. Thus, his mind becomes calm, naturally.
‘Enam’ (this), has been used for the Yogi who attains
"
797,"760 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
tranquillity, as explained in the twenty-fifth verse. Such a Yogi,
attains sattvika happiness.
| In the second half of the twenty-third verse, the Lord offers an —
inspiration to practise the Yoga of meditation, with determination.
He, who practises this Yoga, verily attains sattvika happiness.
The term ‘hi’ used here denotes this certainty.
‘Sukhamupaiti'—It means, that a Yogi has not to make effort
to attain that Supreme Bliss, but it verily comes to him.

The sinless Yogi thus, submerging his self always in God, _
easily enjoys, the infinite bliss of oneness with the Brahma (the —
Absolute). 28
Comment:— _
- 'Yufijannevam sadatmanarh yogi vigatakalmasah'—Here the
_ term ""Yunjan’ does not mean, to fix the mind on God through
practice. It significies one's identity, with God. This identification
is not through mental pursuits. A Yogi constantly unites his self
with God, and thus becomes free from the feelings of egoism, |
and mineness. This freedom from mineness and egoism, means
freedom from sins, as affinity of egoism and mineness, with the
world is the root of sins. |
The phrase ""Yufijannevam’, in the fifteenth verse, has been
used for the Lord with attributes, while here it has been used
for the Absolute viz., the Lord without attributes. Similarly, in
the fifteenth verse, emphasis has been laid to fix the mind on
God, through practice, by the term 'Niyatamanasah’, while here
by the expression ""Vigatakalmasah', emphasis has been laid on
"
798,"Verse 29] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 761 :
renouncement of affinity, with, non-self. There, the mind by
meditating on God, is absorbed in Him and thus the world is
renounced, while here by renouncing affinity with the world, the ~
Yogi gets established in God. Thus, the result ot both, is the same. .
‘Sukhena brahmasamsparSamatyantam sukhamasnute'—In |
unity with God, the feeling of 'T’ does not exist, nor does there
remain its least impression. Infinite bliss 1s the state, in which a
Yogi is immersed in God, and loses his identity. A Yogi attains
this bliss, which has been named ‘Imperishable Bliss’ (5/21)
and ‘Supreme Bliss' (6/21), all these names denote the same,
Divine Bliss. an

The Yogi, whose mind is steeped in Yoga, looks on all with an
equal eye, sees his self present, in all beings and all beings mere
as appearance within his self. 29 |
Comment:— :
'Iksate yogayuktatmd sarvatra samadarsanah'—The Yogi sees
the same divinity in all. As toys made of sugar in the shape of
various birds, animals and men are of the same stuff, sugar; |
various arms and weapons of iron; various toys made of clay
and various ornaments of gold, likewise it is the self, that has
assumed various forms in the universe. So, a Yogi sees the self,
in all objects and beings.
'Yogayuktatma'—It means, that the mind of the Yogi,
by constant practice of meditation is absorbed in the self,
"
799,"762 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
and then his affinity, with the mind breaks off, which has
been indicated by the expression, ""Sarvabhitasthamatmanam
sarvabhutani catmani."" : _
- 'Sarvabhiitasthamatmanam'—As a worldly person, sees himself
in all his limbs, a Yogi, sees his self, in all the creatures. As
in a dream, different persons, animals and objects are a man's
Own creation, and they all disappear when he awakes, similarly
a Yogi, sees his own Self, in all beings because there is no
such existence of the world, as in a dream, it is transient and
kaleidoscopic. It means, that whatever he sees, is his Self.
‘Sarvabhitani catmani'—He sees all beings, as assumed in
the self. As different colours, are born of light and are seen only
in light, and as different objects born of the sun, are seen only
in the light of the sun; so does a Yogi, see that all beings are -
born of the self, merge in the self and are perceived, as assumed
ones, in the self. It means, that one sees the entire creation, as
a manifestation of the self, only. 7
In this verse, it is mentioned that a Yogi sees the Self
present in all beings, but it is not said that he sees all beings, —~
present in the Self. The reason is, that the Self exists in all
the creatures, but the creatures do not have their existence, in
the Self, because they are born and decay, while the Self ever
- remains the same. |
His dealings may differ, with different creatures, but he sees
all, with an equal eye, as he sees the same divinity, in all.

yo marh pagyati sarvatra sarvarh ca mayi pasyati |
tasyaham ha pranasyami sa ca me na pranasyati
He, who sees Me (the universal Self) present in all creatures, _ -
and sees all beings existing in Me, I am never out of sight for him, |
nor is he ever out of My sight. 30
Comment:—
'Yo mam pasyati sarvatra'—A devotee, sees Me in all
persons, animals, birds, gods, demons, things, incidents and
circumstances. When Brahmaji, stole cowherds and calves,
Lord Krsna Himself assumed the form of cowherds and calves
with their flutes, clothes and ornaments etc.* This drama of His —
manifestation, continued for one year, but nobody could know
it. One day, Balarama, the elder brother of Krsna, saw cows,
leaving their young calves who were left at home, run towards -
the big calves. Then, by intuition he realized, that Lord Krsna
had manifested Himself, as those calves. Thus, a devotee sees
God, pervading, everywhere. -
'‘Sarvam ca mayi pasyati'—He sees, all beings existing in
Me. As Lord Krsna shows Arjuna His divine form, He asks | :
him to behold the entire creation, both animate and inanimate |
in His one limb (11/7). Arjuna also says, ""O Lord, I behold in
Your body all gods and multitude of different beings"" (11/15).
Safijaya also says, ""Arjuna then saw the whole universe, with
its many divisions within His body"" (11/13). Thus, a devotee
sees the whole creation existing, in Him.
""Tasyaham na pranasyami'—-When a devotee sees everywhere
Me in each and every object, how can I be out of sight for him?
I always, remain within his sight.
* Lord Krsna assumed the forms of cowherds and cows, the same, in number,
bodies, limbs, sticks, horns, flutes, leaves, nets made of strings and the ornaments.
Their age, habits, nature, names, behaviour and states were all the same, as those
of original ones. At that time, the voice of the Vedas, that the whole is the form
of Lord Visnu, embodied itself (Srimadbha. 10/13/19).
"
801,"164 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
| 'Sa ca me na pranasyati'—When a devotee sees God

everywhere, God also sees him everywhere, because Lord Krsna
declares, ""However, men approach Me, so do I seek them (viz.,
carry out their desires)"" (Gita 4/11). It means, that when adevotee .
identifies himself with God, God in His Universal Self, sees him
everywhere. Thus, he is never out of His sight.

Now, a question arises, why Lord Krsna says, that the devotee
only is never out of His sight when He declares, that none is out
of my sight, ""I know the beings of the past, the present and the
future” (7/26). The answer is, that though none is out of sight
of the Lord, the Lord, sees him everywhere, who sees the Lord
everywhere. But, for those who have a disinclination for God,
and are attached to the world, He is not manifest (Gita 7/25).
Because of his disinclination for Him, he also remains out of
His sight, Lord Krsna declares, in the twenty-ninth verse of the
ninth chapter, ""I am equally present in all beings; there is none |
hateful or dear to Me. But they who worship Me with devotion, _ a
are in Me and I also am, in them."" |

Appendix—-In the preceding verse the Lord mentioned the soul __
(self) but now he mentions the Supreme Soul (God). A striver
following the discipline of meditation because of the past impression
of knowledge, has predominance of discrimination; while the other
striver, having the impression of devotion, has predominance
of faith and belief. Therefore the ‘Dhyanayogi’ with the latent
impression of knowledge discriminately sees the self present
in all beings ‘sarvabhiitasthamatmanarh sarvabhitani catmani’
(Gita 6/29). While the ‘Dhyanayog?’ having the latent impression
of devotion with faith and belief sees God everywhere—‘yo
mam paSsyati sarvatra sarvarh ca mayi pasyati’.

The expression ‘yo mam paSsyati sarvatra’ means that he
sees Me in others and also in himself. The expression “sarvam
ca mayi pasyati’ means that he sees others in Me and also sees
himself in Me. |
"
802,"Verse 31] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 765
As snow is lying everywhere, then how will it hide? If snow
is put behind that snow, then also snow will be seen. Similarly
when God manifests Himself in all forms, then how can He hide, -
where can He hide and behind whom can He hide? The reason
is that there is no other entity except God. In the supreme soul
(God) there is no division of the body and the self, the real and
the unreal, the insentient and the sentient, God and the world,
‘saguna’ (with attributes) and ‘nirguna’ (without attributes), ‘sakara’
(with form) and ‘nirakara’ (without form) etc. In Him only, there
are several divisions and in several divisions only He prevails.
He is not an object to be known by discrimination but He can
be known by faith and belief. Therefore “All is God”—a striver
should assume it, he should accept it with faith and belief. If he
accepts this truth firmly, he will realize the same truth.
A striver first sees God far away, then he sees Him nearby,
after it he sees Him in himself and finally he sees only God. A |
Karmayogi sees God nearby, a Jiianayogi sees Him in himself -
and a Bhaktiyogit sees God pervading everywhere.

Comment:—
'Ekatvamasthitah'—In the previous verse, Lord Krsna
explained that He is never out of sight of a devotee, nor is he
"
803,"766 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
ever out of sight of Him. Why? Because a devotee identifies
himself with God, who abides in all beings viz.,. he develops |
intense love, for Him. | oo :

In accordance with non-dualistic principle, a devotee has no
identity of his own, his identity is merged in the Lord, while, in
dualistic tenets. the Lord and the devotee assume separate entities
outwardly, though inwardly they are one and the same* just as
a husband and a wife possessing two different bodies regard,
themselves as one, and so two friends, who deem themselves
as one. Due to intense love, duality does not exist. A devotee,
who worships God, with wholehearted devotion, gets established
in communion with Him. This oneness and the sameness of a
devotee and God, is called 'Ekatvamasthitah’.

'Sarvabhiitasthitarh yo marn bhajati'—God pervades everywhere -
in all persons, things, incidents and circumstances etc., viz., all
is God, He puts on the appearance of the entire phenomenon,
(7/19)—this is his worship, to God. | | -

'Sarvabhiitasthitam'—By this phrase, it seems as if God abides

only in beings, but actually it is not so, He abides, in each and -
every particle of the universe. In ornaments made of gold there
is nothing, but gold. When ornaments were not made, there was |
gold, even now gold exists in them and there will remain gold
even when the ornaments are broken or spoiled. But, it does not
mean that there is gold only in those ornaments, not anywhere
else. Similarly, God existed, before the creation of the world,
He exists now, and He will exist at the end of the creation. But,
to explain the fact that all beings are just like ornaments, and
God is like gold, it is said that only God abides, in all beings
and He also abides, at all places. : |

*In the Discipline of Knowledge the devotee identifies himself with God
and loses his identity, while in the Discipline of Devotion to exchange and
enhance true (spiritual) love, the Lord and the devotee like Sri Krsna and

: Radhaji, being one and the same become two. a 7
"
804,"Verse 31] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 767
'Sarvatha vartamano'pi sa yogi mayi vartate'—He, while
discharging his duties, according to the ordinance of the scriptures
abides in Me, because in his view there is no independent entity,
except Me. 7 | a | -
In the. thirteenth chapter, in the context of the Discipline of
Knowledge, Lord Krsna announced, ""Even though engaged in
all sorts of activities, he is not born again"" (13/23);. while here,
He says, ""Though engaged in all sorts of activities, he dwells in
Me."" 'He is not born again,’ means that. he is emancipated, 'He
dwells in Me' means, that the devotee, by becoming one with
God, has a unique relish of spiritual love, which is infinite and
which ever enhances. _ :
_ Here, Lord Krsna says, that that devotee-dwells in Him.
Here a question arises, whether other creatures don't dwell in _
Him. The answer is, that all creatures dwell in Him, but by |
attaching importance to the world, they neither know, nor accept .
that they dwell in Him. They, because of egoism and mineness, -
uphold this universe (Gita 7/5). They don't regard the world,
as manifestation of God, but regard it as a separate entity and _
attach importance to it by declaring, 'We are worldly people,’
while a devotee realizes, that it is God Who manifests Himself,
as multitudinous beings viz., so all is God, and so a devotee
always dwells in Him. : | |
Appendix—A devotee sees the entire universe as the
manifestation of God. From his view-point besides God no
other entity exists. For him the seer (onlooker), the seen and
‘that act of seeing’—all the three are only the manifestation
of God—‘Vasudevah sarvam’ (Gita 7/19). As the Ganges is
worshipped with the water of the-Ganges, similarly.a devotee’s
all dealings are focussed on God. As a person who has identified
himself with the body, while performing all actions, dwells in
the body, similarly such a devotee while discharging his duties,
abides in God. | |
"
805,"768 _SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6 |
In the thirteenth chapter the Lord declares—‘sarvatha
vartamano’pi na sa bhiiyo’bhijayate’ (13/23)+-a Jiianayogi.
performing duties in everyway is not born again and here he
_ declares for a devotee ‘sarvatha vartamano’ pi sa yogi mayi vartate’ -
viz., ‘a devotee engaged in all forms of activities; dwells in
Me’. It means that by the path of knowledge a striver is freed
from the cycle of birth and death and he attains salvation; but
by the path of devotion, he is freed from. the cycle of birth and
death, attains oneness with God and develops intimate kinship
with Him. The same idea has been expressed in the Gita in
the following ways—‘tasyaham na pranasyami sa ca me na
pranasyati’ (6/30), ‘priyo hi jianino’tyarthamahamh sa ca mama
priyah’ (7/17), ‘jiani tvatmaiva me matam’ (7/18), ‘ye bhajanti
tu marn bhaktya mayi te tesu capyaham’ (9/29). In the Discipline
of knowledge because of the presence of an iota (trace) of subtle -
ego there can be philosophical differences but in the Discipline
of Devotion because of oneness with God, not even an iota of
subtle ego and the philosophical differences caused by that ego 7
remain. In ‘na sa bhiyo’bhijayate’ a striver having realized the
self gets established in the self, the self. remains, while in ‘sa -
yogi mayi vartate’ only God remains, the Yogi does not remain
as a Yogi but he becomes an embodiment of God.

and attributes).

[What has been mentioned, as ‘Identified with Brahma (the
Absolute)’ or ‘Attainment of Infinite Bliss', in the twenty-seventh
and twenty-eighth verses respectively, in this verse, Lord Krsna
explains the behaviour of such an enlightened Yogi towards |
others. ""Such a Yogi is devoted to the welfare of all beings""
(5/25, 12/4).] | oe
'Atmaupamyena sarvatra samam pagyati yo'rjuna'—An ordinary
person, regards the injury of any of his limbs as his own, because
according to him he and his limbs are one and the same. But a
Yogi regards others as his own Self and thinks of their harm as
his own harm. If any afflicted person comes before him then that -
Yogi tries to alleviate the suffering of that man in the same way
as he attempts to alleviate the suffering of any limb of his own
body. Meaning thereby that as an ordinary man is engaged in -
providing comfort to his body. So too the Yogi is automatically
engaged in making others happy. _ | -
‘Sarvatra' (everywhere), means that he is engaged in promoting
the welfare, of all beings without any distinction of caste, creed
and colour and does good, even to animals, birds, trees and
plants etc. By him, efforts are automatically made to alleviate,
their suffering. ©
He knows, that limbs have different shapes and functions,
yet he makes efforts to soothe the afflicted limbs, equally. Hands
cannot be used, as feet. If by chance, a hand is touched by another
hand, we do not wash it. But, if it touches a foot, it is to be
washed. When an organ of excretion is cleaned by a hand, we
wash the hand, with clay. Thus, one observes, touchability arid
untouchability with others, also in accordance with the ordinance
of scriptures. But, it does not mean, that he hates them. He loves
all of them and does good to them, as he does to his own limbs. _
"
807,"770 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
‘Sukham va yadi va duhkham’'—To feel happy and sad, on the
analogy of his body does not mean, that if a person is injured, this
enlightened soul, feels that injury in his body. If it were taken as _
such, the affliction of the enlightened soul, would be enormous,
because the world is full of afflicted persons. It means, that as
an ordinary and ignorant person attached to his body, makes
efforts to relieve bodily pain promptly, an enlightened: soul does
the same, to others; and as an ignorant man is not proud of such
actions performed for his body, an enlightened one is also not
proud of performing these for others. He is naturally engrossed
in the welfare of others. Moreover, an enlightened soul, can bear
his bodily pain and remain indifferent to it, but he cannot bear
the pain of others, and so always remains prepared to relieve
their suffering. So he thinks that he has the power to bear the
pain, as he knows that he himself is different from his body, -
while the ignorant people have no power to bear the pain, as |
they identify themselves with their bodies. Indra, the king of the _
gods, beheaded sage Dadhici—though the latter had caused no
offence to the former. Dadhici was brought to life, by Aévini-
kumaras, the twin sons of the sun who are supposed to be the -
physicians of the gods. But, when Indra demanded bones of
Dadhici, to make a thunderbolt, Dadhici offered him his bones,
by abandoning his body. | :
: Here a question arises, that an enlightened soul, is prepared
to remove the pain of others, while he shows indifference to his
own bodily pain, and suggests it, that he lacks equanimity. The
answer is, that this attitude is superior to equanimity, because it
becomes his nature, without having the least unevenness of mind.
‘Sa yogi paramo matah'—-That Yogi, is regarded as supreme,
because he sees nothing but God pervading everywhere, all the
time and remains established in union with Him.
(i) For a Yogi of meditation, it has been said, ""He looks
"
808,"Verse 32] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 771
on all as one, on the analogy of his own self."" For a Yogt of
Discipline of Action, it has been said, ""He identifies his self,
with the self of all beings"" (5/7). For a Yogi of the Discipline _
of Knowledge, it has been.said, ""He is devoted to the welfare of .
all"" (5/25, 12/4). But in the Discipline of Devotion, a devotee sees
the Lord (the universal self). present, in all beings (6/30) and he
worships Him through the performance of his own duty (18/46).
It means, that a striver, following the Discipline of Action as
well as Knowledge, should see his own self in all beings, while
a striver following the Discipline of Devotion, should see the
Lord, his beloved Deity, present in all beings.
_ . (ai) A feeling of brotherhood is an excellent one. But, when
self, interest comes in, as In the case of the Kauravas and Pandavas,
this feeling of brotherhood changes into enmity. But he who |
looks on all alike, on the analogy of his own body, cannot have
feelings of enmity, for anyone. For example, no one gets angry
with the teeth or pulls them out, if they accidently happen to -
bite the tongue or lips. Similarly, an enlightened Yogi, has no
enmity for anyone, he takes joys and sorrows of others, as his -
own. Superior to this feeling, is one that God is present in all
beings. Thus a devotee sees his favourite Lord, everywhere. So,
Lord Krsna declares him to be superior to others. He says, ""He
is considered by Me to be, the best Yogi"" (6/47), ""I consider
them to be the best Yogis"" (12/2), ""Those devotees are extremely |
dear, to Me"" (12/20) and so on. os OO
Appendix—-A common man sees the self in the body. He
does not want pain in any organ, does not have aversion to any
organ but regards all the organs as his own equally. Similarly
a devotee beholds God in all beings and tries to alleviate their
sufferings and-to comfort them equally. He regards the objects,
ability and power etc., not as his own but as God’s. As the.
Ganges is worshipped with the water of the Ganges and the sun
is worshipped with an earthen lamp, similarly a devotee offers
"
809,"772 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA _ [Chapter 6
the Lord’s things in rendering service to Him—‘tvadtyarh vastu
govinda tubhyameva samarpaye’.

As having proper dealings with different organs of the body, -
a common man regards them as the self and tries to alleviate
their pain and to comfort them equally. Similarly according to
the saying ‘as a deity, so the worship’, dealings with a Brahmana
and a pariah, with a sage and a butcher, with a cow and a dog
will be different according to the ordinance of the scriptures
but the devotee beholds God in all of them and so he tries to
alleviate their sufferings and to comfort them equally without
any distinction. :

As a devotee assumes the identity of God with the soul of
all beings (Gita 6/31), similarly he assumes the identity of all
bodies with his own body. Therefore he feels happy with the _
happiness of others and sad with the sadness of others—‘para
dukha dukha, sukha sukha dekhe para’ (Manasa; Uttara. 38/1).
He like the joys and sorrows of his own body, takes the joys and -
sorrows of others as his own. “To feel sad with the sadness of
others’ means to make efforts to alleviate the sorrows of others, .
rather than to become sad seeing them sad, similarly in order to
be happy himself, he has not to alleviate the sorrows of others,
but being compassionate he has to make efforts to make others
happy. It means that he has not to enjoy happiness himself but
he has to feel happy by seeing that the other person has got rid
of sorrows and has become happy. a

There is so much difference between the eyes and the feet
that we see with eyes and we walk with feet, the eye 1s the sense
of perception while the foot is the. organ of action. In spite of
so much difference, there is so much identity that a thorn runs
into the foot and the eyes are filled with tears; dust falls into
the eyes and the feet totter. It means that we can’t separate the
body from the world and can’t separate the world from the body.
Therefore if we take care of own body, similarly we should
"
810,"Verse 33] - SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 773
take care of the world; and if we are indifferent to the world,
we should be indifferent to our body. Accept anyone of these
two—this is honesty. _ -
Link:—Lord Krsna explained the Discipline of Meditation,
as a means to attain equanimity, from the tenth verse to the |
thirty-second verse. A doubt arises in Arjuna's mind, and he
puts it before Lord Krsna, in the next two verses.

Arjuna said:
O Krsna, this Yoga of equanimity has been preached by You -
but I do not perceive its stability, due to restlessness of mind. 33
Comment:—
[Lord Krsna, in the gospel of Gita, has laid great emphasis
on equanimity, in success and failure etc. This equanimity, leads
a man to salvation. Arjuna was afraid of sins by waging war. So
Lord Krsna, exhorted him, ""Treating alike pleasure and pain, gain
and loss, victory and defeat, engage yourself in the battle. Thus
you will incur no sin"" (2/38). In this world, people incur so many
sins, but we are not held responsible for these, because we are
equanimous. Similarly, while performing actions and discharging
our duty, if we remain equanimous, those actions do not lead us
to bondage. Therefore, Lord Krsna in the beginning of this chapter
said, ""He who discharges his duty, without expecting the fruit
of actions, is a Sannyasi and.a Yogi."" The result of renouncing
"
811,"774 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
the fruit of actions is equanimity. Lord Krsna described,: the
Discipline of Meditation, as a means of attaining equanimity, from
the tenth to the thirty-second verses. Keeping this equanimity in
mind Arjuna puts forth his doubt before Lord Krsna.]
""Yo'yam yogastvaya proktah sAamyena madhusiidana'—Here
the doubt which Arjuna conveys to, Lord Krsna, is not about
the thirty-second verse, but about meditation, because in the
thirty-second verse there is reference to an enlightened soul who
is always equanimous. Therefore, here the word Yah’ (which)
denotes, Yoga (equanimity) and 'Ayam' (this).denotes meditation,
detailed from the tenth verse to the twenty-eighth verse.
'Etasyaham na pasyami caiicalatvatsthitim sthirim'—Here,
Arjuna seems to mean, that equanimity can be easily attained,
by the Discipline of Action, but it 1s difficult by the Discipline
of Meditation, owing to restlessness of mind. |
It means, that a striver cannot concentrate his mind on God,
so long as the mind is restless, and without concentration of -
mind, equanimity cannot be attained.

'Caficalam hi manah krsna pramathi balavaddrdham'—Ayjuna
addresses the Lord as Krsna, because He has the power of
"
812,"Verse 34] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 775
attraction. So, He should attract his mind and concentrate it on —
Him, because it is very difficult for him to control it, as it is
unsteady and restless. Besides being restless, it is turbulent, it -
distracts a striver from the right course. Moreover, it is obstinate
and strong. | |
According to Lord Krsna, ""Desire has five locals:—the
senses, mind, intellect, sense-objects and self"" (Gita 3/40, 3/34,
2/59). Actually desire (Kama) vests, in the embodied Self, but
it seems to reside, in senses, mind and intellect etc. Unless it is
removed from the self, it appears in the senses and mind etc.,
from time’ to time. But, when it is destroyed from the self, it
does not appear anywhere. This proves, that so long.as desire
subsists.in the self, the mind torments a striver. Therefore, the
mind has been called turbulent. Similarly, the senses torment the _
mind, of a striver. So, the mind has been called turbulent, in the
sixtieth verse of the second chapter. It means that when desire |
appears in the mind and senses, it torments the striver and does -
not allow him to remain established, in the self. —
Because of the desire inhering in the self the mind is attracted -
intensely towards objects etc., and does not abandon them, in
anyway. So it is called obstinate. This obstinacy of the mind is
very strong, and so the mind is called strong. It forcibly distracts
a striver, from his course and leads him to sensual pleasures.
So it has. been mentioned in scriptures, ""Mind leads a man to
emancipation, and bondage.” But the mind, remains turbulent,
obstinate and strong, so long as desire rests, in the self. When
a striver himself, becomes free from desires, objects and senses
do not affect him at all, and turbulence, obstinacy and strength
of the mind, perish. . | | ce :
Restlessness of the mind, is an obstacle so long as, desire
resides in the self. But when desire is rooted out, it is not an
obstacle in the least. It is mentioned in the scriptures—
""When the feeling of egoism (T'ness with matter) 1s rooted
"
813,"716 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
out, and one realizes God, one's mind perceives God, everywhere
_ viz., one attains by constant trance (natural trance)."""" ~~
‘Tasya'‘ham nigrahamm manye vayoriva suduskaram'—It is
difficult to control, this restless, turbulent, strong and obstinate
mind. As one cannot catch hold of wind, in the same way, mind
cannot-be controlled easily, it is very difficult to control it. —
Appendix—The Lord in the twenty-ninth verse mentioned
the experience of the striver who meditates on the self, while
from the thirtieth to the thirty-second verses he mentioned the
experience of the striver who meditates on God endowed with
attributes and form. In these verses the Lord means that the final
result of the discipline of meditation is to see the self or to see
God in all. The Dhyanayogi, having the impression (latency) of
knowledge, sees the self in all; while the Dhyadnayogi, having -
the impression of devotion, sees God in all. To see the. self
in all is ‘atmajfiana’ (Self-realization) and to see God in all is
‘God-realization’. In Self-realization there is predominance of —
discrimination, in God-realization there is predominance of belief
and faith, not the predominance of the steadiness of mind. But -
in Arjuna’s mind the impression of the discipline of meditation
mentioned from the tenth to the twenty-eighth verses was lingering.
Therefore he regarded fickleness of the mind as an obstacle to
Self-realization or to God-realization. He did’nt pay attention
towards the impression of knowledge or devotion but he thought
of the volatility of mind. Therefore he thought that volatility
of mind was the obstacle to Self-realization or God-realization.

demanded a boon of adversity, from Lord Krsna.* Such cases are _
rare in history. So Lord Krsna, wants to remind Arjuna, that he
is the son of such a dispassionate mother. Being dispassionate,
he should concentrate his mind, on God. -

An earnest, regular and persistent attempt, te concentrate the
mind on God, is called practice. This practice should be done
with respect and adoration, for God by attaching importance to |
Him. This practice is of two kinds:— :

(i) A striver should concentrate his mind on the target and
being indifferent to thoughts, that come to mind.

(1) A striver, should concentrate on his deity, wherever the
mind wanders. |

There are some other ways also, of concentrating the mind
on God.

* OQ preceptor of the world, grant us adversity so that we may have your rare
vision which may enable us not to be reborn.

- oo , (Srimadbha. 1/8/25)
"

(1) A striver should exhale air two or three times, and
then think that he has discarded the world of his mind, and so
whatever thoughts will come to mind, will be a manifestation _
of God only—this is ‘Vasudevah sarvam'’. oe .
- (2) Recite the name of the Lord, and listen to it. There
should not be any time-lag between the recitation of one name,
and the next. - oS
(3) Recite Gods name and :count,the number through the
mind, without using fingers or a rosary of beads, to count.
(4) Recite, one, name of the Lord, as ‘Rama’ (with the voice)
and remember another name, as ‘Krsna’ (within the mind). |
-(5) Chant the name within the mind. __ a
(6) Think of a form of the Lord, from top to toe and from
toe to top. ; | | | -
(7) Think that the Lord is standing before you. Think of His
form. Write mentally, on His toes, five names, on the lower part _
of the leg, three names, a little above it, two names, a little above
it three names, below and above the knee, one name each, on |
the thigh, three names, on the righthand side of the waist, two
names, on the rib, three names, on the shoulder, two names, on
_ the upper part of the arm, three names, above and below the
elbow, two names in the form of a ring, on the five fingers five
names, round’ the throat, four names as half of a garland, in the
ear, two names as an earring, on the righthand side of the crown,
six names, by making three rings. ys
Thus, by writing fifty-four names, on the righthand side and
fifty-four names on the lefthand side, we think of all the limbs
of the Lord and count the. hundred and eight beads of: a rosary.
We can do this once or twice a day. _ ——
Thus, there. are different methods of concentrating ones mind
on God. A striver can also think of other means himself.
This practice of concentration,.needs dispassion because the
"
816,"Verse 36] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 779
more dispassionate a man is, the easier it will be for him to
concentrate his mind, on God. If he has no attachment for the
world, he will not think of the world. If a thought, because of /
past influences, comes to his mind, he should become indifferent
to it, without having any attachment or aversion. By doing so,
the thought perishes. Thus by practice and dispassion, a mind
can be controlled. a a |
The Methods to Develop Dispassion
1. The world is kaleidoscopic, while the self never changes,
in the least. We cannot live with the world and the world cannot
live with us. Our babyhood, boyhood and youth, have passed.
Similar, is the case with circumstances. By thinking of reality,
we can become dispassionate.
2. We should satisfy, the just desires of our family and
relations, according to our power, ability and resources, without
hope of reward. Thus, old attachment is wiped out, and new -
attachment is not born. | |
_ 3. We should think that all sins, crimes and pains, are the .
fruits of attachment, while peace and bliss, are the fruits of
dispassion. By thinking so, we can develop dispassion.

subdued but it can easily be achieved by him, who has controlled |
"
817,"780 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA | [Chapter 6
his mind and who strives ceaselessly; such is My conviction. 36
Comment:—

‘Asathyatatmana yogo dusprapa'—It is my opinion, that Yoga = -
is hard to attain, for one whose mind is not subdued, because
restlessness of mind is not such a great obstacle, to attain Yoga
as is the uncontrolled mind. As a chaste wife controls her mind
but she does not concentrate. So too, a striver should control .
his mind. By controlling. the mind, a striver, can concentrate
on God.

Generally, strivers have a tendency to be engaged in spiritual
discipline with faith, but they do not make persistent efforts,
with the result, that their mind and senses, are not controlled
and thus Yoga is difficult to attain. That is why even ever and
everywhere present God is not easily attained. _

Strivers have no disinclination for pleasures, as they have
for the forbidden food, such as meat etc. Eating forbidden
food, causes degradation. But enjoyment of sense-objects with ~
attachment, causes much more degradation. In eating meat,
Strivers have a notion, that this 1s a prohibited item, but while -
enjoying sense-objects, they do not have this thought. Worldly
pleasures leave their influence, which continues for ages and
which induces them to incur sins. Due to this inclination for
pleasures, they are unable to control their mind and senses, and
so they find it difficult to attain Yoga. |

'VaSyatmana tu yatata Sakyo' vaptumupayatah'— Yoga can be
attained, by him who has controlled his mind and who strives 7
ceaselessly viz., one who is regulated in diet and recreation,
sleep and wakefulness—such is My conviction. |

A striver, who wants to control his mind, should understand
that he is a devotee and a striver, not sensual, he is God's and
so, he should take refuge in Him; he is a seeker after knowledge,
and so he should obtain it; he is a servant and so he has to serve
others, without having any desire. Thus, if a striver changes his
"
818,"Verse 36] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 781
ego, (‘I'ness), the mind can easily be and quickly, controlled.

When mind is purified, it is controlled spontaneously.
Attachment of mind for the perishable, is its impurity. When the :
striver has an exclusive aim, of God-realization, his attachment
is renounced, and his mind becomes pure. |

A striver should always be careful, he should never have, a_
claim on others’ things etc., because by laying such a claim his
mind becomes impure. In business, service or other transactions,
he should never adopt foul means, he should never try to take
the share of others, but he should give a part of his own share,
to them. By doing so, his mind is purified.

In the Discipline of Meditation, Arjuna said, ""Mind is restless, _
therefore, I consider it as difficult to control, as the wind."" In
response to this problem Lord Krsna, offered a solution, by
saying, ""It can be controlled by practice and dispassion."" Out 7
of these two, for meditation, practice is more significant (Gita
6/26), while in the Discipline of Knowledge, dispassion is more ~
important. Though dispassion is helpful, in the Discipline of
Meditation, yet in this discipline, mind can be controlled, even
when attachment persists. According to the philosophy of Patafijali,
one's mind can be controlled by practice. If dispassion is the
cause of concentration, how can one gain accomplishments, or
worldly fruits, by the concentration of mind? How concentration ,
of mind could result in getting occult powers or worldly fruits
unless one had a desire for them. If these were obtained as a
result of concentration of mind, it proves that concentration can
be had with desires subsisting in the mind. But when the aim
is to realize God, concentration of the mind and a trance, are
helpful in God-realization.

The next stage, after concentration of the mind, is trance.

There is a minor deviation from the state of trance also. It means,
"
819,"782 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter 6
that in that state there lingers affinity for matter. When this
affinity breaks off, a striver realizes the Self, from where there
is no deviation. Lord Krsna, in the gospel of Gita, did not talk
much, about the concentration of the mind, because it was not His
aim. Concentration of mind according to Him, is only a means |
_ to achieve an end, either mundane or spiritual, while attachment
for the world, is the main obstacle to God-realization. Therefore,
a striver should renounce his affinity for matter. First, a striver
may have attraction for a trance, but when he attains a state of
trance, he has no attraction for it, he becomes indifferent, to
: it. As soon as, he becomes indifferent to it, he gets established
in the self, which is called the attainment of Yoga. This Yoga,
(unity), is constant and eternal. :
Appendix—In fact in order to attain perfection by the discipline
of meditation, restraint of the mind is not so necessary as is its 7
purification. ‘Purification of the mind’ means not to be attached to
the sense-objects.. He who has purified his mind, attains perfection _
by the discipline of meditation by making efforts.
Whatever the Lord said in the thirty-first verse by the :
: expression ‘sarvabhitasthitarh yo mam bhajatyekatvamasthitah’
in that. the main obstacle is not to behold God in all beings and
everywhere; and whatever the Lord declared in the thirty-second
verse by the expression “atmaupamyena sarvatra sama pasyati
yo rjuna’—the main obstacle is attachment and aversion. But
Arjuna by an error thought the volatility of mind as an obstacle.
In fact. volatility of mind is ‘not an obstacle but not to behold
God in all beings and everywhere’ and ‘attachment-aversion’ are
obstacles. So long as attachment and aversion persist, a striver
can’t behold God in all beings and everywhere and as long as
he does not behold God in all beings and everywhere viz., he __
_ has the assumption of any other entity besides God, the mind
| can’t be totally restrained. |
_ When a. ‘Vrtti’ is restrained, it means that there is existence
"
820,"Verse 37] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI | 783
of the “Vrtti’. Because we accept its existence that is why we
think restraining it. In the self there is no ‘Vrtti’. Therefore if
we restrain the “Vrtti’ the mind will be restrained for sometime -
and again there will be relapse (deviation). If we don’t assume
any other entity besides God, then there is no question of relapse. -
The reason is that if there is no other entity, there is no question
at “all of the existence of mind even. © 7 | |

By addressing the Lord as Krsna, Arjuna means to say, that
He who attracts all creatures is the controller of their destiny.
Therefore, he asks Him in which direction, he will attract him
and what fate he will meet with. - )

Appendix—In ‘karanasapeksa’ discipline (discipline dependent
On instruments), a striver with mind, gets established in the 7
self—‘yada viniyatarh cittamatmanye vavatisthate’ (Gita 6/18).
Therefore by having connection with the mind, his mind deviates -
and so there is possibility of his falling from yoga. When a
striver regards ‘karana’ (instruments) as his own, then he practises .
‘karanasapeksa’ discipline (discipline dependent on instruments). ""
A Dhyanayogi by regarding the mind (Karana) as his own
concentrates it on God. By fixing the mind, he falls from Yoga.
Therefore the reason for his falling (deviating) from Yoga is
dependence on instruments. This ‘karanasapeksata’ (dependence on
instruments) is not required in the three disciplines—Karmayoga,
Jnanayoga and Bhaktiyoga. |

A Dhydnayogi is reborn because of the deviation of the
mind viz., by falling from His discipline; but a Karmayogi or a
Jiianayogi is reborn because of the worldly attachment.

In Bhaktiyoga there is dependence on God, so He provides
special protection to his devotee—’ yogaksemarn vahamyaham’ (Gita
9/22), ‘maccittah sarvadurgani matprasadattarisyasi’ (Gita 18/58).

_ ‘Apratistho mahabaho vimidho brahmanah pathi'—He

as rain, is separated from the main body and cannot join the
other parts. Thus it is shattered. In similar the fate of a striver
who renounces his dependence on the world, but at the same
time fails to realize God? Does he meet with damnation?
Here, the illustration of a cloud is not quite apt, because
a part of a cloud and the main body of clouds and the part to
which it was going to rejoin—all the three belong to the same
class, they are matter. But in the case of a striver, the world is
matter (insentient), while he himself and God, are sentient. Thus
they do not belong, to the same category.
In this verse, Arjuna means to say, that the soul being a
- fragment of God, is imperishable. If it has the aim to attain heaven,
it might have gone to heaven or hell or the other lower births
"
823,"786 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
of beasts and birds, but still would have remained in the world.
What is the fate of a striver, who has renounced dependence on
the world with the aim of attaining God, but could not realize :
the same and at the time of death, could not think of God?
| An Exceptional Fact | 2

Here failing in both does not mean that he has fallen from Yoga
as well as God-realization. A striver cannot have a downfall, if
he has attained God-realization. Here the iilustration of a cloud,
with a part separated from the main body and not joining the other
clouds and is scattered in between the two, is not very apt, as
a striver, who has not yet realized. God cannot be said, to have
fallen from God-realization. Moreover, once God-realization is
attained, there is no question of being detached from it. Thus, if =|
a person fails to think of God at the last moment, he may be said
to have failed in attaining God, but he cannot be said to have
failed in both i.e., Yoga and God-realization. Therefore fallen = -
from both here means that he is deprived of both God-realization
and worldly enjoyments. Arjuna has also dwelt upon the same 7
point, in the thirty-seventh verse. Thus a sttiver can deviate from
Yoga, only if he has not realized God. After God-realization,
there is no question of deviation or downfall from Yoga.

The Blessed Lord said: : :

O Partha, there is no fall for him, either here or hereafter; for

Comment:— _

[Arjuna is much anxious, to know the end of a striver,
who has failed to attain perfection, in Yoga. Lord Krsna knows
Arjuna's anxiety and so He removes it.] -

""Partha naiveha namutra vinaSastasya vidyate'—O son of Prtha,

a striver who deviates from Yoga, never falls (Gita 6/41—45).

It means that he does not go to a state, inferior to what he has. |
already attained. His. spiritual practice, and aim go with him, to

his next birth and he will not take birth, again and again.

Sage Bharata, by renouncing his kingdom observed penance, —
in seclusion. There, out of pity, he was attached to a young deer,
with the result that he had to get birth, as a deer. But he did -
not fall to a state inferior to what he had already attained, even
in the life of a deer. In that life also, it remembered its past
(Srimadbhagavata Section V, Chapter VII, VU). Similarly, one
who practises Yoga, but fails to attain perfection, may get birth
even as an animal, but does not fall to a state inferior to what
he has already attained, as he retains the spiritual propensities, |
stored up in the previous birth. This draws him towards God. I
myself have observed a dog sitting with devotees, listening to
religious discourses and moving about, with a group of devotees,
who were chanting, the Lord's name loudly.

'Na hi kalyanakrtkaSciddurgatirn tata gacchati'—Here ‘tata’, a
word of endearment, has been used. In the whole Gita, this word
has been used only once. It shows Lord Krsna's great affection
and grace, for Arjuna. The pronouncement of the Lord, is a
"
826,"Verse 40] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 789 |
great assurance for all strivers, ""The doer of good never comes
to grief"", or ‘One who works for self-redemption, never meets
with an evil fate’. It means, that a striver who, without being
attached to pleasure and prosperity, and engaged, in spiritual — 7
discipline to attain God-realization, has no fall, because He is ~~ :
his saviour. a oe

One, who is engrossed in the welfare of all creatures, and |
thinks of God-realization, 1s the most loving to Him, because he
is His fragment. So he has a real affinity for Him. How can he
meet with ill fate? Sometimes, it may seem, that he had fallen to
a state inferior to what he had already attained. But it so happens,
because of his pride. The Lord, gives him a warning, so that he
may be aware of his state and turn towards Him again with zeal.
Lord Krsna disappeared during His drama (pastime) of human
life, from the midst of the Gopis. At that time, they were very -
much perturbed and were at their wits end. Then He reappeared
again and said to them, that He had disappeared adoring them -
(Srimadbha. 10/32/21). Their welfare and memory were lingering,
in Him. When a person is inclined towards Him, he is most
loving to Him because He thinks that after having lost his way -
for long however he has started following the right way. God,
like a mother, always promotes the welfare of a devotee.
_ It means that feelings of spirituality once germinated, cannot
be wiped out, because whatever is done for God, becomes real
(Gita 17/27) viz., the real never ceases to be (Gita 2/16). Therefore, |
Lord Krsna says, that one who works for self-redemption never :
meets with an evil destiny, because the impressions of the past,
always imspire him towards spirituality. Even, if one goes to
lower births, his nature will be superior, to that of other members
of his class.*

Though Arjuna puts the question, ""What end, does a striver

* One whose nature has been good cannot take birth as a harmful poisonous :
creature such as a snake or a scorpion etc. |
"
827,"790 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
' meet, at the time of death?"" Yet Lord Krsna answers, that there
is no fall for him, here or hereafter. Now a question arises, why
Ajamila and Bilvamangala, were overpowered by prostitutes, _
and why there was a fall for them. The answer 1s, that people
thought that they had a fall, but actually it was not so. After
_ leaving the body, Ajamila was escorted by courtiers of the
_ Lord; and Bilvamangala, became a devotee of God. A devotee, ©
following spiritual discipline, may seem to have been degraded
sometimes, because of his carelessness. But, he never falls to a
state inferior to what he has already attained. If he happens to
have association, with the good or misfortune befalls him, he again
starts following the spiritual path, speedily.* But delay in God-
realization is indeed, a kind of downfall for him. Bad company
-etc., are decidedly obstacles for a striver, to spiritual progress.
So he should always beware of bad company, and should never
be overpowered by sensual pleasures and lust etc.

Comment:— -
'‘Prapya punyakrtarh lokan'—Those people, who make offerings
etc., in accordance with the ordinance of scriptures, attain the
worlds of the righteous viz., heaven. It means, that the righteous :
not the sinners, attain heaven. But strivers who have no desire
to reap the fruit of their virtuous actions, attain heaven without
much effort, while people who perform oblation, attain heaven
by making efforts. Moreover, in heaven also, their subtle passion
lingers, because their aim is to enjoy pleasure. Those, who at
the time of death, deviate from Yoga, attain heaven, but they
become indifferent to pleasures, as their aim is not to enjoy
pleasure. They have to go to heaven, because of their subtle -
desire, which is an obstacle to God-realization.
'Usitva SaSvatih samah'—Heaven, is attained, both by those
who perform penances and actions with some interested motive, -
as also, by those whose aim is to realize God, but deviate from
Yoga. However there is a vast difference, between the two. -
The former, having enjoyed heavenly pleasures, return to this
world of mortals on the exhaustion of their merit, and thus they
can stay there for a limited period only, while the latter, can
stay for an unlimited period, because their aim has been God- :
realization. Because of having a latent desire they go to heaven,
but they cannot be entangled in pleasure there. And their spiritual
development is not affected. The reason is, when even a seeker
of the Yoga, transcends the fruit of actions (6/44), how can one, _
who has deviated from Yoga, get entangled?
'Sucinarn srimatam gehe yogabhrasto'bhijayate'—The devotee,
who has deviated from Yoga after enjoying celestial pleasures,
ceases to have any taste in them and is reborn in the house of
the pure and prosperous, as a result of his sacred and spiritual
pursuits. There he, though subject to senses, feels drawn towards

Comment:— | — |
[There are two kinds of strivers—with having subtle desires,
and without such desires. The striver, whose aim is to realize
God and is interested in spirituality, but his desires have not been
wiped out completely, after living for countless years in heaven,
is reborn in the house of the pious and prosperous. This type of
striver, has already been described in the previous verse. In this
verse, there is a description of the striver, who is free from desire,
has developed dispassion, has only, the aim of God-realization
and practises Yoga, but has not attained perfection and deviated
from Yoga. Such a striver, instead of going to heaven, directly
takes birth in a family of enlightened Yogis.]
"
830,"Verse 42] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 793
‘Athava'—I have answered your question, about a striver
who deviates from Yoga, at the time of death. Now I want to
tell you about a dispassionate striver, who has disinclination for ;
the world, and is interested in spiritual perfection, but at the time
of death however if he deviates from Yoga.
“Yoginameva kule bhavati dhimatiém'—The dispassionate
striver, is born in the family of the enlightened Yogis, who
have realized God and whose intellects are fixed in Him.
It is mentioned in the scriptures that the beings born in
the family of the enlightened Yogis must get enlightenment
(Mundaka. 3/2/9). |
""Etaddhi durlabhataram loke janma yadidrsam'—Such a
birth, is very difficult to obtain in this world. In the family of
enlightened Yogis strivers get a favourable environment, which 7
draws out the latent Yoga element in them, and leads them
rapidly towards their goal. -
In the verse ‘Etat’ refers to a striver born in the family of the
enlightened Yogis, while 'Idrsam' means that he has got a chance
to have company of the enlightened Yogis. In the world, there
are two kinds of people 'Binduja’ and 'Nadaja’. Those who are
born of ovum and sperm of parents are called 'Binduja’, while
those who start following the spiritual path by the preaching of
great souls, are ‘Nadaja’. Here, he who is born in a family of
enlightened Yogis after falling from Yoga, is ""Binduja’ while the
striver who gets an opportunity to have the company of liberated
souls, is 'Nadaja’.
In the scriptures, it is mentioned that it is difficult to obtain
human life, but it is even more difficult to have company of great
souls. Naradaji, has also written in his book 'Bhaktisutra’ that
"
831,"794 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
the company of .great. souls, is very difficult, inaccessible and
infallible. The reason is, that great souls are very rare, and if by
God's grace one. gets their company,* it is difficult to recognise _
them. But the company of great souls, never goes in vain.

his birth, there. | | |

Comment:—

‘Tatra tarn buddhisamyogam labhate paurvadehikam'—The ~
term ‘Tatra’ (there) has been used to describe the condition
of the dispassionate striver after his birth in the family of the
enlightened souls. | |

'Paurvadehikam'—(Acquired in the former body) and
‘Buddhisarhyogam’ (spiritual discernment) phrases mean, that
the dispassionate striver, does not go to heaven, but is born in
a family of enlightened Yogis, where he regains knowledge of the
previous birth, and is naturally drawn towards God, because of
the impressions and latencies of the previous birth and continues
to practise Yoga. A traveller, while travelling on foot feels tired,
and sleeps on one side of a footpath. But, when he awakes, he
has not to cover the distance, which he has already covered.
Similarly a striver, regains the knowledge of the previous birth.
He is like a student, who goes through old lessons and grasps
"
832,"Verse 43] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 795

these immediately. Thus, favourable impressions of the previous |

birth, are aroused in him. a
""Yatate ca tato bhiyah samsiddhau'—In favourable surroundings, oa .

a striver tries harder, than before, for perfection: : oe

If we interpret, that both kinds of strivers, who deviate from
Yoga, go to heaven, and out of them, the one who has desire for
pleasure is born, in the house of pious and prosperous, while the
other who has no lust is born in a family of enlightened Yogis,
will it make any difference? Yes, it will. We cannot call the
striver, 'Paurvadehika’ (of the former body) if he is reborn after
going to heaven, because the duration of his stay in heaven,
will come in between the two births. Moreover, in heaven he |
cannot have union with knowledge, because there is abundance
of pleasure, in heaven. _

There is one more point, which needs attention. A striver,
having lust goes to heaven. But why should a striver who is free
from passion and lust, go to heaven? It is a kind of punishment -
to send, such a striver to heaven, which is fully unjustified.

Appendix—tThe spiritual progress pertains to the self and the -
mundane progress pertains to the non-self. Therefore the worldly
wealth gets destroyed but the spiritual wealth is not destroyed
even by falling (deviating) from Yoga. The spiritual progress can
be veiled but cannot be destroyed and is revealed at times.

The impressions of the spiritual practice of the previous life
that are settled (left) in a striver’s intellect, have been called
here ‘buddhisarnyoga’.

Link:—In the previous verse, Lord Krsna explained that a
striver who is born in a family of enlightened Yogis regains, oe
knowledge of the previous birth and strives more than before,
for perfection. Now he describes the striver who deviates from
Yoga, and is born in the house of the pious and prosperous.

One who takes birth in the house of the prosperous, though
subject to the senses, is drawn towards God because of the former

~ Comment:— |
7 ‘Purvabhyasena tenaiva hriyate hyavaSo'pi sah'—A striver, who
is born in the house of the pious and prosperous, does not get
such a favourable environment and company, as. the one who is
born in the house of enlightened Yogis, yet because of sacred and _
spiritual propensity stored up in the previous birth, he is drawn
towards God, in spite of his attachment to pleasures.

‘Avaso'pi’ means, that though he has lived in heaven for ~
countless years and enjoyed pleasure there, and in the house
of the prosperous also, there are pleasures in abundance, he -
is overpowered by his senses. In spite of all this, he is drawn
towards ‘God, by force of the practice of the previous births.
The reason is, that the passion for pleasure is unreal, while the
influence of the spiritual life, is real. So the real influence draws
the striver, who deviates from Yoga, towards God.

'Jijiiasurapi yogasya Sabdabrahmiativartate'—In this verse, Lord
Krsna explains the importance of a seeker of Yoga, in order to
describe the importance of the Yogi. When the seeker of Yoga,
transcends actions and their fruits as laid down in the Vedas, how
can he having a firm determination for God-realization, have a
fall? He will surely, attain salvation or God-realization.

| The seeker of Yoga is he who attaches more importance
to Yoga than pleasures and prosperity but his desire for
pleasures and prosperity has not been wiped out. He has not
"
834,"Verse 44] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 797
attained perfection (to Yoga) and is a seeker of Yoga. Even
such a seeker transcends the actions and their fruits. Then
the striver who has deviated from Yoga is far superior to the /
seeker. The same fact has been explained by Lord Krsna in
the fortieth verse of the second chapter when He declares, |
""In this path of Yoga (equanimity) there is no loss of effort
and even a little practice of this discipline protects one from
great fear (of birth and death) viz., leads him to salvation.""
Thus the one who practises Yoga cannot have a fall, he will
undoubtedly attain perfection or salvation.

(i) Such strivers who practise Yoga but deviate from it are
very rare. Among thousands of people scarcely one strives for
perfection (Giti 7/3) and it is he who deviates from Yoga. There -
is great glory of such strivers. Even the seeker of the Yoga
transcends the fruits of actions viz., he develops disinclination -
even for the highest level of celestial existence, the Brahmaloka
(the abode of Brahma), because all the worlds including that of .
Brahma involve return and rebirth while he does not want rebirth.
When there is so much glory of the seeker of Yoga, how far
superior should the striver who practises Yoga, be? The reason
is that his aim has been to attain Yoga (equanimity) though at
the time of death he has deviated from Yoga.

Therefore, if a striver has an exclusive aim to attain God-
realization, he will transcend the fruits of actions, performed
with some motive as laid down in the Vedas.

(ii) Even if a striver fails to attain equanimity, he should have
it as his aim. As Tulasidasaji has said in the Ramacaritamanasa
about himself that he is a man of the meaner sort but his ambition
is very high, he wants to get nectar though even butter milk is
not available to him (1/8/4). It means that the striver should
have a lofty aim and he should have a keen desire to achieve
"
835,"798 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
that aim. It is God's nature that He does not mind the error of
action of the striver but He notices what he wants, feels, aims
and remembers hundreds of times what he has in his heart and
is pleased with it (1/29/2-3). | |
A blind saint went to a temple to behold the Lord. One day
a person asked him why he had gone to the temple when he
was unable to see the Lord. The saint replied, ""It is true that I
am unable to see Him. But is He also unable to see me? My
purpose is served when He beholds me."" a
Similarly, we may not attain equanimity but we should have
an aim to attain it. By doing so our purpose will be served
because God is omniscient and. He knows what a striver has |
in his heart. : :

_ Appendix—The worldly virtues (such as feeding poor etc.,
with desire for fruit) are virtues contrary to sins but the divine
virtues inculcated through association with God are extraordinary.
Therefore the worldly virtues do not draw a man towards God;
but the virtues pertaining to God, draw man towards God. These -
virtues are not dissipated by bearing fruit (Gita 2/40). Renunciation
of worldly desires and inclination towards God—these two are
virtues pertaining to God. . | |

‘Purvabhyasena tenaiva’—This expression means that though
in the present life the striver does not get an opportunity of good
company and good discussion pertaining to God, yet because of
the past latencies he is drawn towards God. In this past practice
there is no action (pravrtti) but there is (automatic progress)
‘gati’.* In ‘jijfia@surapi yogasya Sabdabrahmativartate’ also there
is no practice of action but there is progress as ‘gati’. It means |
that in this practice there is no effort and there is no doership

~ * In order to know the distinction between ‘Pravrtti’ and ‘Gati’ vide appendix
to the sixth verse of the fifteenth chapter (6/45).
"
836,"Verse 45] - SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 799
but there is ‘gati’ (automatic elevation). In ‘gati’ there is the
power of attracting a striver towards God. An endeavour for
spiritual gain is an action while ‘gati’ automatically goes on
(due to past latencies). | :

birth in the family of enlightened Yogis and striving more than

'Tu'—It means when the seeker of the Yoga of equanimity

should not transcend the fruit of actions and attain perfection.

steadily. He remains constantly conscious that he has to follow
~ - this path. . a ee |
The striver deviating from Yoga takes birth in the house
of the pious and prosperous and is drawn on one side towards _
God by force of the former practice, while on the other side
towards the world because of the worldly temptation. If he
by diligent efforts and manly behaviour renounces worldly
pleasures, he will realize God. The reason is that when even
a seeker of Yoga transcends the fruit of action, why will a
Yogi who strives with assiduity not realize God? As a person
engaged in forbidden action after getting a shock, deviates :
from it and strives more for God-realization, a striver by -
taking birth in the house of the pious and prosperous strives
hard. for God-realization. oe | oe
‘SamSuddhakilbisah'—By striving for God-realization, he is
purged of all sins viz., his desire for pleasures, prosperity, praise ;
and honour etc., is completely wiped out. His diligent efforts
reveal that he is purged of all sins. :

_ ‘Anekajanmasarhsiddhah'*—Spirituality has enhanced in him
through successive births. He has been purified from sins in the
human birth by practising Yoga, in the second birth in heaven
by having disinclination for pleasures, and in the third birth in
the house of the pious and prosperous by striving assiduously
for God-realization. Thus he is purified from sins through many
births.t Here many births denote these three births.

* ""Anekajanma’' (many births) means more than one birth. .

+ Similarly, a dispassionate striver who has deviated from Yoga is purged
of sins first by being dispassionate and secondly by striving promptly for God-
realization by getting birth in the family of the Yogi. Thus these two births are
many births for him.
"
838,"Verse 46] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI  =————™—CO. 8011
‘Tato yati param gatim'-——Therefore, he reaches the supreme
state. It means that he attains the Supreme Bliss, by gaining
which He does not reckon any other gain greater than that,
and wherein established he is not moved even by the heaviest |
affliction (Gita 6/22). — . oe a
a | A Vital Fact |
_. In fact every human being has passéd through many births
already. Therefore he has been called 'Aneka-janma-sarhsiddha’. In
heaven he enjoyed the fruit of his virtuous actions and thus was
purged of virtues. In hells by suffering tortures he was purged of
sins. Similarly, in the eighty-four lac forms of lives by getting
the fruit of his sinful actions he was purged of sins.* Thus by Oo
being purified from virtues and sins he has perfected himself.
Secondly, a human being by striving assiduously can attain
the Supreme State or Supreme Goal because the Lord by His
grace has bestowed upon him this human birth, the very last of
all births so that he may attain the Supreme Bliss. Therefore, -
every person should strive assiduously to attain perfection or
the Supreme Bliss.

‘Jnanibhyo'pi mato'dhikah'—Jfiant (men of learning), in

this context are those, who possess knowledge of scriptures,

such as the knowledge of the Disciplines of Knowledge, Action

and Devotion etc., and deliver discourses, but whose aim, is to

enjoy pleasure and prosperity. A Yogi, is superior to such men -

'‘Karmibhyascadhiko yogi'—A Yogi, is superior to those

ritualists, who perform elaborate rituals, such as sacrifice, charity,

and pilgrimage etc., in order to, obtain pleasure and prosperity

etc., here and hereafter, because the Yog1's aim is to realize God,

while the ritualists has a desire, for worldly enjoyments etc. 7
Thus a Yogi, is superior to ascetics, also men of learning

and ritualists, because his aim is to attain God-realization,

while others' aim, is to enjoy worldly pleasure and prosperity

etc. Ascetics, men of learning and ritualists—all the three, are

engaged in activities. Forbearance in ascetics, learning in Jnanis,

and rituals, in ritualists are special characteristics of the three.

All the three, having selfish interests, are not Yogis but Bhogis

(sensuous). If they had been selfless Yogis, God would have

neither compared them with a Yogi, nor would He have declared,

a Yogi superior to them. |
'Tasmadyogi bhavarjuna'—Therefore, Arjuna, be a Yogi free

from attachment and aversion viz., remain detached just like a

lotus leaf which though constantly in touch with water, does not

permit being wetted with it. The same fact, has been explained |
by Lord Krsna when He declares, “Be established in Yoga, O :
Arjuna” (Gita 8/27).
In the beginning of the fifth chapter, Arjuna asked Lord .
Krsna, ""Which of the two renunciation of action (Sankhyayoga),
or performance of action .(Karmayoga), is better?” In response to
his question Lord Krsna explained Sankhyayoga (the Discipline .
of Knowledge), Karmayoga (the Discipline of Action) and
Dhyanayoga (the Discipline of Meditation). But He, before this
verse, did not advise him to be a Yogi. It is only here that He
directs him to be a Yogi, because it is decidedly good for him. |
Appendix—There are two different spheres—one for ‘Bhogis’ _
(voluptuary) and the other for ‘Yogis’. A “Bhog? is not a ‘Yogi’
and a “Yog?’ is not a ‘Bhogi’. Those who work with an interested -
motive are ‘Bhogis’; while those who work in a disinterested
manner are ‘Yogis’. Therefore a Yogi, who has no desire for
fruit, 1s superior to ascetics, men of learning and ritualists who
have selfish motives. -

Comment:—
""Yoginamapi sarvesam'—Those Yogis, who want to break off
their affinity for Matter and practise the Disciplines of Action,
Knowledge and Meditation etc., are superior to ascetics, and
ritualists etc. But he who devoutly worships Me, is the best of all.
""Yah Sraddhavan'—He, who has faith only in Me, and My
glory, and existence, worships Me, with his mind focussed on Me.
‘Madgatenantaratmana mari bhajate'-—When a. striver,
accepts the affinity that he is God's and God is his, his mind
gets engrossed, in God automatically. As the mind of a girl
after her marriage is absorbed in the affairs of the house, of her ~~
father-in-law, a devotee's mind gets absorbed in God, without _
making any effort. His mind, while he performs several duties
of his routine, clings to God, automatically.
All activities, whether spiritual such as meditation, worship
etc., or secular, such as eating, sleeping or pertaining to livelihood,
such as farming, business or service etc., of a devotee, who ”
becomes only God's, without having any attachment for the |
world, are included in adoration. |
Lord Krsna in the fifty-fifth verse of the eleventh chapter,
explains the traits of a devotee having exclusive devotion to God,
who works for the Lord's sake, depends on Him, is devoted to
Him, is free from attachment and is without hatred, for any being.
‘Sa me yuktatamo matah'—All strivers, who having
disinclination for the world, are inclined towards spirituality,
and want to realize God, are devout. Those, who seek refuge
in the Lord, who is endowed with attributes, but is formless
viz., all-pervading Lord, are more devout. However, those who
take refuge in the Lord, Who is endowed with attributes, are
the most devout.
"
842,"Verse 47} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 805
A devotee, who is most devout, will get mastery over all
kinds of disciplines, (Yogas) such as of Action, Knowledge and
Devotion etc., because God is the great Lord of all the Yogas ;
(disciplines), and when a devotee takes refuge in Him, he becomes
the most devout.
The most devout, devotee never falls from Yoga, because
his mind never abandons the Lord, and therefore, the Lord
also does not abandon him. At the time of death, because of
unconsciousness or much pain, if he 1s unable to think of God,
God thinks of him.* So how can he fall from Yoga?
It means, that a devotee who wholeheartedly depends on -
God without depending on anyone else, or even on his efforts
does not fall from Yoga. God does not let him down. But, he -
who attaches value to worldly things and relies on his efforts,
for him there is possibility to fall from Yoga. His fall, may be |
due to his mind's diversion towards the world. A devotee, does
not fall because at the time of death, he calls the Lord due to -
his sole dependence on Him. Even if he is unable to think of the
Lord, the Lord thinks of him, because of his exclusive devotion
and thus he instead of falling, from Yoga, attains Him.
The Lord declares, such a Yogi is the most devout Yogi. It
does not mean, that other Yogis do not attain Yoga. It means,
that though all the Yogis by breaking off their affinity for the
world, become completely free from bondage and sins, and attain
the Supreme Bliss, yet, spiritual love manifests itself in him,
who becomes God's and that love accelerates every moment
without any decay, extinction and satiation. It is because of
*The Lord declares—""I myself think of the wood-like and stone-like
devotee at the time of his death and bestow upon him the Supreme State.
If a devotee at the time of death because of phlegm and wind etc., can't
think of Me, I Myself think of him. If I don’t do so, no one else can be
nore ungrateful than I.""
"
843,"806 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 6
this. manifestation, that the Lord regards, such a devotee, as the
most devout. | : : |

In the beginning of the fifth chapter, Arjuna asked Lord
Krsna; ""Which of the two, the Yoga of Knowledge or the Yoga _
of Action, is better?"" Lord Krsna replied, ""The Yoga (discipline)
of Action, is superior to the Discipline of Knowledge."" But He
did not tell him which discipline, was good for him. After
describing these in the fifth chapter, in the beginning of the
sixth chapter, He laid emphasis on the glory of, the Discipline
of Action. Then He described that equanimity, which is attained
by the Discipline of Action, is also attained by the Discipline
of Meditation, and He explained the Discipline of Meditation.
Then Arjuna said, that unsteadiness of mind is an obstacle to /
meditation. So Lord Krsna clarified the doubt. After that Arjuna -
asked, ""What fate does a striver, whose mind is diverted from
Yoga at the time of death, meet with?"" Lord Krsna, answered
the question and, in the forty-sixth verse while describing the
glory of Yoga, ordered him to be a Yogi. But, Lord Krsna did
not clearly mention, which Yoga in his opinion, is superior to 7
others. So, in the forty-seventh verse, He himself declares, ""He
who devoutly worships Me, 1s the best Yogi"".-But, Aruna 1s
not able to understand His view-point, and so he again puts the
question, at the beginning of the twelfth chapter, ""Who is the
better of the two—the devotees, who with their minds constantly
fixed in You, adore You, possessed of form and attributes, or
those who adore only the imperishable Formless Brahma?"" In
response to this question Lord Krsna says, ""I consider them to be
the best Yogis who, endowed with supreme faith, and ever-united
through love, with Me, worship Me, with mind centred on Me.""

The Lord, declares that a devotee following the Discipline
"
844,"Verse 47} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 807
of Devotion, 1s the best Yogt of all the other Yogis, because
the man (soul) is a fragment of God, and by accepting his
affinity for the world and the body, he is bound. When he
breaks off this assumed affinity, he becomes free and happy.
Though in this freedom, there is no dependence, on things,
men and actions etc., yet if he enjoys this freedom by thinking,
""I am free from pain and desire,"" he has subtle affinity, for
the world. This is finiteness (limitedness), in assumed freedom.
This state is called, state of having become one, with the eternal
(Gita 18/54). | |
This subtle egoism is also wiped out by being established
in that state of identity with the eternal, because by having no .
affinity for matter and its evolutes, egoism which is a fragment
of Matter, comes to an end. It means, that Yogis of Action and -
Knowledge, become free from egoism, with the passage of time.
But, the egoism of a Yogi of Devotion perishes in the very |
beginning, as he becomes God's. A Yogi of Devotion, possesses the
traits of friendliness, compassion etc., for all beings (Gita 12/13), -
which are rarely found, in the Yogis of Action and Knowledge.
It means that a devotee, following the Discipline of Devotion,
regards himself as insignificant from the very beginning* and he
develops the virtues of politeness, friendliness, compassion and
self-satisfaction etc., during the period when he strives, and these
virtues attain maturity during the state of perfection. Therefore,
subtle egoism, of a devotee perishes. So the Lord has called
such a devotee, the best.
The uniqueness of devotion, is that it accelerates in the new
form, it does neither attenuate, nor perish, nor get satiated. The
Lord also longs for such devotion, or love. This desire of the

: There is one ‘more point, which needs attention. In the, :
Disciplines of Action and Knowledge, a striver has his: own

devotee without having any independent faith or belief of his
own, depends completely on God, he identifies his desire with
His desire. He does not worry, even to attain salvation or God- ©

for his bodily maintenance and protects, what has already been

Appendix—A man is said to be established in that thing or
person where his mind and intellect get fixed (Gita 12/8). Here -
the expression ‘madgatenantaratmana’ denotes that his mind is
focussed on God, and the term ‘Sraddhavan’ denotes that his
intellect is fixed on God. Therefore such a devotee because of
his intimate kinship with God is established in Him. —

Out of all the Yogis such as Karmayogi, Jiianayog1, ;

_ Dhyanayogi, Hathayogi, Layayogi and Rajayogi etc., the devotee
of God is the best of all. The same fact about His devotee
has also been mentioned in several other references as ‘te me
yuktatama matah’ (12/2), ‘bhaktaste’tiva me priyah’ (12/20) and
‘sa yogi paramo matah’ (6/32).

Devotion is the most important of all the disciplines
for God-realization. Not only this but all the disciplines end
in devotion. Karmayoga and Jiianayoga etc., are means but
Supreme Love is an end. Devotion is so extensive that it is at
the beginning of every discipline and is also at the end. Devotion
at the beginning of every discipline consists in the form of
attraction towards God because without attraction no one can
engage himself in spiritual practice. At the end of a discipline,
"
846,"Verse 47] _SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 809
devotion~is, transformed into the form of Supreme Love which _-
enhances every moment—‘madbhaktirh labhate param’ (Gita
18/54). Therefore in ‘Brahmasiitra’ the ‘Dharma’ in the shape ,
of the devotion for God has been declared -as superior to other ;
‘Dharmas’——‘atastvirajyayo lingacca’ (3/4/39). oe |

His devotion is unworldly. In attainment of the Supreme Love
only lies the fulfilment of human life. |

INTRODUCTION
Lord Krsna, in the forty-sixth verse of the sixth chapter,
described the glory of a Yogi and in the forty-seventh verse, He
declared, ""Of all Yogis, he, who devoutly worships Me, with
his mind focussed on Me, is considered by Me, to be the most
devout Yogi."" When a devotee thinks of God, he gets absorbed
in Him. Similarly when something concerning His devotee is
discussed, God also becomes enraptured in it. In the same state
of mind, also Lord Krsna, full of grace and affection for Arjuna,
starts the seventh chapter on his own. |

| | The Blessed Lord said: | |
Listen, O Partha (Arjuna), how, with your mind attached to
Me, and taking refuge in Me and practising Yoga, you will, without
any doubt, know Me fully. 1 |
Comment:—
""Mayyasaktamanah'—He, whose mind is attached to Me alone,
has not to think of Me, but his mind always remains absorbed in
Me. He is not, in the least, attached to the sensual pleasures of
this world or the next world, and remains indifferent to comfort,
name, fame and other, earthly or heavenly acquisitions.
There are two means, by which mind may be attached to Him.
"
849,"812 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 7
(i) A striver, who from his heart depending only on God,
adores Him, his mind, by His grace is attached to Him. As a
servant, in his master’s house, even without doing any work
as the master did not allot any work for him on a day gets
payment, a devotee with the only aim to attach his mind to Him ;
by depending upon Him, gets success in attaching his mind to
Him, by His grace. - |
_ (i) God pervades everywhere, at all times and in all things,
: men and creatures etc., and He belongs to all. So a devotee
thinks, that He is here, He is present at the time, He is in
him, and belongs to him also. By believing so, if he chants
His name, his mind gets attached to Him very easily, during
spiritual practice. : | ;
'Madaégrayah'—He takes refuge in Me alone viz., and depends
on Me, alone. -
It is in the nature of man, that he depends on someone, or
the other. Being a fragment of God, he actually seeks God. But :
he, without knowing his true affinity for God, accepts his affinity
for the body and the world. All the worldly things, including -
body, are perishable and so they cannot satisfy him, while God, is
eternal, gracious and omnipotent, so he, by accepting his affinity
for Him, should depend on Him only, and be subject to His
| will, because He creates even unfavourable circumstances, for
his welfare.
Mind in God, gets absorbed through love. Love develops
through affinity. Dependence is sought, upon the greatest and the
most powerful, God is omnipotent. Therefore, a striver should rely
on Him only, and remain happy in His dispensation. He needs
nothing, such as, an individual, an object or any circumstance.
Dependence on God, in this way is 'Madasrayah’.
'Yogam yuijan'—A striver by accepting his true affinity
for God, remaining equanimous in success and failure, adores
Him. His performance of different activities either spiritual or
"
850,"Verse 1] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI _ 813
mundane, is practice of Yoga. It means that he, depending on
God with his mind attached to Him, accepts his union with Him,
while discharging his duty. All his activities, are according to
His will. He does not act in such a way, that he may suffer
disunion from Him. | .

‘AsamSayam samagram mam'—He, whose mind is attached
to the Lord, who depends on Him and who has accepted his
true affinity for Him, knows Him in full, without any doubt viz.,
he knows that the Lord, manifests Himself in the form of Lord
Siva, GaneSa, Siirya (the Sun) and Visnu. He is known both
with form and attributes; and without any form and attribute.
He ts also in the form of incarnations.

_ A Jijanayogi, can know Him and realize Him. But a devotee,
can know Him in full, and have His vision in the form of his -
favourite deity. The Lord does not stop thinking of the devotion
of His devotees. : : |

'Yatha jiasyasi tacchrnu’'—By the term ""Yatha’*, Lord Krsna
says, that He will tell him how to know Him; and by the word
'tat't, He means, that He will tell him that, which he wants to _
know. In these words, Lord Krsna by using the second person |
for Arjuna, asks him to listen to Him, how he will know Him,
in full.
In the forty-seventh verse of the sixth chapter, in the expression
'He who worships Me endowed with faith, is deemed by Me,
to be the most devout’, the Lord by using ‘he’ the third person,
makes a general statement, while here in the expression 'Hear
how you shall know Me' He uses the second person pointedly
* The. term ""Yatha’ has been used to describe how to know him from the
gross to the subtle (As water is subtler than earth, fire is subtler than water and
air 1s subtler than fire etc.). It has been described from the fourth to the seventh
verses of this chapter.
f'Tat' means that God is the seed of the world. It has been described from
the eighth to the twelfth verses of this chapter.
"
851,"814 | SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
to address Arjuna, how he will know Him fully.

In the first six chapters, the word ‘Samagram’ (in full), has
not been used for the Lord. So, this term signifies, different
forms of the Lord, as well as, His glory and other divine traits,
while this term, in the twenty-third verse of the fourth chapter, |
in the expression 'He who works for the sake of sacrifice, the
whole action, is dissolved’ the term, 'whole’ has been used for
totality of actions. | BS

(i) Lord Krsna means that a devotee will know Him in full,
if he, instead of having attachment for pleasures, is attached to
Him. If he instead of depending on body, family and prosperity, —
depends on Him, and if he has no desire of his own.

(ii) Real affinity for God, is called 'Yogarh’ and assumption
(acceptance) of that affinity incessantly, is called ""Yufijan’.

It means, that a striver instead of assuming his affinity for
body, mind and senses etc., should realize his real affinity,
for God. | -
In fact practice of Yoga is not so important, as renunciation
| of attachment, for and dependence, on the world. By doing so,
meditation upon God will be practised automatically, and all
~ actions will be performed, without any desire for their fruit. In
such a case, he will not have to practise Yoga. It means, that
he who attaches importance to the perishable worldly things and
persons etc., cannot know, the all-pervading God. If a man has
_ links with a great man of the society, he feels exalted. Similarly,

- when our intimacy is aroused with God, who is our disinterested
friend and well-wisher and Whose fragment we are, how much
more exalted we must feel! In that case, unique and supreme
love, is aroused and the striver's mind gets attached, to Him and
he depends on Him, quite spontaneously. :
"
852,"Verse 1] ~ SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 815
-
: ‘Agraya’, ‘Avalambana’, 'Adhinata’, ‘Prapatti' and ‘Sahara’,
are synonyms of the term ‘surrender’ (refuge), yet they have
different meanings. _ | °
(1) Agraya:—We cannot live, without the support of earth.
In the same way, we cannot live, without the support of God.
This is called 'Agraya’.

(2) Avalambana:—lIf a man's arm is broken, it is dressed and
slung from the neck, with a band. Thus the arm, is supported with
a sling, while hanging from the neck. In like manner, a helpless
person seeks refuge in God. This support is called 'Avalambana’.

(3) Adhinat&a:—It is of two kinds: (a) Someone may force |
us to depend upon him. (b) We ourselves may willingly, depend _
on some other. Similarly, a devotee with exclusive devotion and
without any selfish motive, becomes an attendant upon God,
by regarding Him, as his master. This service with exclusive :
devotion, is called 'Adhinata’. :

(4) Prapatti:—When a devotee, like a helpless person, offers -
obeisance before a great man, prostrates before God, it is called
‘Prapatti’.

(5) Sahara:—When a devotee, in order to be liberated, from
the cycle of birth and death, takes refuge in God, like a drowning
man who catches at a straw, it 1s called ‘Sahara’.

A devotee, is said to take refuge in God, when he is attached
only to God and depends only on Him i.e., when he fixes his
mind and intellect only, on God. When a man himself takes
refuge in God, with his mind and intellect, he possesses all the
virtues, of a surrendered devotee.

When a striver resolves, that his so-called mind and
intellect, are God's, his mind is naturally attached to Him, and
he depends only on Him i.e., he becomes 'Mayydsaktamanah’'
and 'Madaérayah’. : |
"
853,"816 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA - [Chapter 7
In fact, all the worldly things are in the process of decay
‘every moment, and we being eternal, have’ no real affinity with
_ them. So, if we renounce this assumed affinity,.and only.aim at
__ salvation, we shall.take refuge in Him automatically, because we.
are God's, despite ever having developed disinclination for Him,
due to our inclination, for the world. As soon as, this. assumed
affinity or inclination are renounced, our: affinity or inclination
for God, will manifest itself, and that is axiomatic.
Appendix—-The devotee, whose mind has been naturally
attracted towards God, who has taken refuge in God and who
has accepted his axiomatic eternal union (intimate relationship)
with God, knows God in full. All is God this is the integral
(entire) form of God. | | ee |
In the term ‘mayyasaktamanah’ there is predominance of
love (devotion) and in-‘madasrayah’ there is predominance of _
faith (belief). : po |
‘Samagrarh mam’— In this expression the term ‘samagrarh’
is adjective and the term ‘marh’ (God) is the noun qualified.
A devotee’s affinity instead of being with adjective is with the |
noun-qualified i.e., with God. —
In the expression ‘sraddhavan bhajate yo mam’ used at the
end of the sixth chapter, what is the form of ‘mam’? The Lord
answers the questions here—‘mam’ is My entire form.
“Yatha jnasyasi tacchrmu’—I shall describe My full form
in such a manner, using such a device, in such a style that you
will easily know My real form. | :
Arjuna in the preceding chapter expressed his doubt—‘etanme
samSayam krsna’ (6/39). Therefore the Lord here declares that He
will unfold to him the fact by which he will have no doubt.

knowledge about Me, is limited, so they cannot know Myself, in

omniscient. After knowing it, nothing else remains to be known.
In the sixteenth verse of the tenth chapter, Arjuna says -
to Lord Krsna, ""You alone can describe in full; Your divine
glories"" (10/16). So Lord Krsna in response to his curiosity,
says, ""I shall tell you of My important divine glories, because
there is no end to My manifestations"" (10/19). At the end of
this chapter again, He declares, ""There is no end of My divine
glories” (10/40). Here (Gin 7/2) He declares, ""I shall unfold to
you the true essence of real knowledge (realization) and having
* Here the adjective ""Vijnana’ qualifies the noun 'Jiiana' and so is superior to
‘Jnana’. Here the belief that the world is born of the Lord and again merges in Him
is knowledge (wisdom) (Jiiana) while the realization, that in the world there is
nothing else except the manifestation of God, is the real knowledge (Vijiana).
7 A man cannot describe his own experience in full because the thoughts
and feelings cannot be clearly expressed in words. When a man cannot express his
own experience in words, how can he teach and unfold the knowledge (wisdom)
along with real knowledge like the Lord?
"
855,"818 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 7
known which, nothing else remains to be known.” It means, that
God's glories, manifestations and powers etc., are endless. In the
Ramacaritamanasa also, it-has been-declared, ""The form of the
Lord. without.attribute, is easy to know, while the form endowed —-
with attributes, is too difficult to understand. His manifestations,
are so varied, that even ascetics find themselves, at their wits end.

It means that there is no end to the glories of ‘the Lord,
endowed with attributes. So, how could a man know Him, by
using his mind? But a man can know the Divine essence, which
is all-pervading. As in different ornaments, made of gold, there
is nothing but gold, similarly, in the whole universe, there is
nothing else, except Divine manifestation. A-man, can know of
gold without knowing about different ornaments. Similarly, a
striver, can know that God pervades everywhere, in all creatures -
and things etc., even though, he may not know the names of
different .creatures and things etc.,. which form parts. of His
divine glories. By. knowing the reality about God, nothing else
remains to be known, in the same way, as thirst is quenched,
after drinking water. — . : -

In the second verse of the tenth chapter, the Lord declared,
""Neither gods nor great sages, know the secret of My birth.” In
the third verse, He declares, ""He who knows Me, as unborn and
without beginning, among men, is undeluded and purged of all
sins."" Now, a question arises, how a man can know Him, when
even gods and great sages, do not know Him. The answer is, that
if a striver, accepts Him as unborn and without beginning, with
a firm faith, it means that he knows Him, because it is within
the power of man, only to accept Him as unborn and without
beginning. As a child, cannot see a marriage procession of its
parents, so to gods, sages, liberated souls etc., cannot know
of incarnations, godly sports and divine glories, of the Lord,
because He is limitless and unfathomable. But a devotee can
know Him in essence. |
"
856,"Verse 2] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 819

In order to know the Lord in reality, in the Discipline of
Knowledge, there is pre-eminence of knowledge, while in the
Discipline of Devotion, there is pre-eminence of assumption, or
acceptance. If reality is accepted firmly, it cannot be given up, :
because it is real. When no one, can force a man to renounce,
even a false assumption, how can an assumption of real affinity
for God, be renounced? This assumption, is in no way, less
significant than knowledge; it is as effective as knowledge. |

In the Discipline of Devotion, there is pre-eminence of
acceptance. In the first verse of the tenth chapter, Lord Krsna says
to Arjuna, ""O mighty-armed, listen to My supreme word, which I
speak to you, out of a desire to do you good."" Here, ‘listen’ means .
‘accept’. Importance is attached to acceptance, because it is, the
context of devotion. In the Discipline of Knowledge, importance is ~
attached to knowledge. In the first verse of the fourteenth chapter,
Lord Krsna declares, ""I impart to you, the supreme knowledge, the
best of all forms of knowledge, acquiring which, all sages have |
attained the highest perfection."" In the Discipline of Devotion,
a striver knows Him by accepting His Existence, while in the -
Discipline of Knowledge, a man accepts Him, by knowing Him.
In perfection, both of them, are identified. _ |

An Exceptional Fact Pertaining to Knowledge (Wisdom)

The world, is born of the Lord and it merges into Him.
Therefore, He is the root of the world—this belief (acceptance)
is knowledge. There is nothing in the world, except God viz.,
the world is nothing except manifest Divinity—this realization,
is real knowledge (Vijfiana).

Lord Krsna (in 7/4—6) declares, ""My nature, is of two
kinds—lower and higher and I am the origin of the whole
universe."" By this declaration, Lord Krsna referred to knowledge
(Jnana). ""There is nothing else, besides Me. Like. clusters, of
"
857,"820 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA (Chapter?
yarn-beads, formed by knots on a thread, all this is threaded on
Me"" (7/7). By this declaration Lord Krsna explains what real
knowledge (Vijiana) is?

""I am the sapidity in water, the light in the moon and the
sun, the eternal seed, of all beings. Whatever other entities
there are, born of sattva (the mode of goodness), of rajasa (the
principle of activity), (the mode of passion) and of tamasa (the
principle of inertia), (the mode of ignorance), know these all,

| as evolved from Me, alone"" (7/8—-12). By this declaration, He
explains the essence of knowledge. ""In reality neither I exist in
them nor they in Me viz., I manifest Myself in all forms, because
none have their free existence"" (7/12). By this declaration, He
explains realization (Vijnana). _

""The whole of this creation, is deluded by objects, evolved

from the three modes of nature (prakrti). But those who are
not deluded, by the modes of nature and accept that these are
born of Me and are absorbed in Me—by accepting so, they
take refuge in Me alone, and cross the divine illusion of Mine. — -
Such devotees, are of four types—a seeker of worldly objects,
a sufferer, the seeker of knowledge, and a man of wisdom. All
these, are noble but the man of wisdom is extremely dear, to
Me and he is My own Self"" (7/13—18). By this declaration, He
explains of knowledge, ""The man of realization, who realizes, that
all is God, is very rare (7/19)."" By this declaration He explains
realization, (Vijiiana). |

""Those who, being motivated by desires worship gods, gain
perishable fruit, while those who are My devotees, attain Me. I
am not manifest to those, who do not know Me, as the unborn
and imperishable Supreme Spirit. I know the beings of the past,
the present and the future, but no one knows Me. Those, who are
subject to illusion, by the delusion of pairs of opposites, follow
a cycle of birth and death. But, the sins of those who worship
Me with a firm resolve, come to an end, and they become free
"
858,"Verse 2] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 821
from the pairs of opposites” (7/20—28). By this declaration also,
He explains knowledge (Jnana), “Those who take refuge in Me,
know Brahma (the Infinite), Adhyatma (Embodied souls), Karma
(Action), Adhibhuta (Matter), Adhidatva (Brahma) and Adhtyajiia -
{the unmanifest Divinity), viz., they realize that I manifest Myself,
in all the movable, as well as the immovable (7/29-30). By this.
declaration He explains realization (Vijfiana).
'Yajjfiatva neha bhiyo'nyajjiatavyamavasisyate'—After
knowing this wisdom, and with realization, nothing remains
to be known. It means that there is nothing else besides Me
(Gita 7/7), and that all, is God (7/19). After knowing this reality,
nothing else remains to be known. On the other hand, if a striver
possesses all knowledge about the world, without knowing Me, -
all his efforts are in vain, they bear no fruit. -
Whatever, a striver knows with his senses, mind and intellect, —
is not true knowledge about God, because these all belong to
matter and matter cannot know reality, which is beyond matter.
When one takes refuge in Him, he knows Him naturally, without
making any effort, because He can be known by the self, rather -
than, with mind and intellect etc.
Appendix—The Para Prakrti (higher nature) and the Apara
Prakrti (lower nature) have no independent existence—this is
‘jana’ (knowledge) and the higher and the lower nature—all .
is God—this is “Vijfiana’. Therefore all including ‘ego’ is only
God—this 1s Jiana with Vijiana. :
‘Jnatavyam’—which must be known and which can be known
is called ‘Jiiatavya’.
Having known ‘Jnana’ with ‘Vijiana’ viz., the entire form of
God, nothing remains to be known viz., he who wants to know
the Pure-Reality, nothing remains to be known to him. The reason
is that when there is nothing else besides God (seventh verse of
this chapter), then what more will remain to be known?
Someone may raise a question that the Lord declares that
"
859,"822 S§RIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
he. will tell ‘Jiiana’ with ‘Vijiiana’, it means. that the primary
importance goes to. ‘Jnana’ while -“Vijiiana’ is of secondary
importance. But. actually it is not so, only ‘Jiiana’ can lead
to salvation but ‘endless bliss of love’ is attained only when -
it is accompanied by ‘Vijnana’. ‘Jana’ is like money and
‘Vijiiana’ is the feeling of attraction. Money does not provide
the pleasure which attraction for money provides. Similarly the
bliss that is attained by “Vijfana’ (devotion) is not attained by
‘Jnana’ (knowledge). In ‘Jnana’ there is constant relish but in
“Vijnana’ there is such a relish which goes on increasing every
moment. Therefore while declaring ‘Jiana’ with ‘Vijfiana’, the
Lord specially aims at ‘Vijnana’ and he wants to explain that

it is superior to ‘Jiana’ because ‘Vijnana’ stands for the Lord’s |

entire form. -

that only those persons who do not indulge in the sensuous

of those, men who follow virtues and righteousness, are only

Persons, who have no desire to go to heaven, and to enjoy

past impressions who do not deviate from their principles and -

Worldly pleasures, seem pleasant only in the beginning. If strivers,

worldly pleasure and prosperity. Some people, who transcend
worldly pleasures, run after heavenly pleasures. But, there are

Therefore, the expression 'Manusyanam sahasresu kascidyatati siddhaye' means
‘Manusyanam sahasrani bhagavati rucim kurvanti sahasresu kascit siddhaye yatati
ca'1.e., ‘thousands of men have an inclination to God but one of those thousands :
of men strives to attain perfection.
* Divine perfection does not mean worldly and heavenly enjoyments and
accomplishment such as ‘Anima, Mahima’ and 'Garima’ etc., because they lead to
a downfall and to the cycle of birth and death (9/21). Therefore, here perfection
means God-realization.

| In fact, it is not. difficult to attain, God-realization but there
are oily a few aspirants who strive, sincerely from their heart, to
realize Him. Now, a question arises; why: do not strivers strive

for God-realization? The answer is, that there:are two stumbling
blocks—attraction of sensual pleasures and hope to realize Him,
_ 'Yatatmapi siddhanam'|—Here, ‘Siddha’ (the successful one),
is the striver whose mind has been purified, and whose only
aim, is to realize God. Though (in 7/19) the man of realization
who realizes that all is God, is called a gréat soul, yet in this
context, great souls are those strivers, who possess divine nature,
worship the Lord constantly, with exclusive devotion (Gita 9/13),
and strive to realize Him. ~ nn eT

Here, 'Yatatam' means, that strivers want to realize God,
from their heart and so strive for Divine perfection, and naturally
think of Him, with révérence. _ So -

'Kascinmam vetti tattvatah'—'Scarcely one knows Me in
reality.’ Here it does not mean, that the strivers who strive to _
know Him, cannot know Him. But, at present, anyone striver
out of the assiduous strivers, knows Him in reality; out of those
who know Him, scarcely anyone can speak of Him, and explain
to others. Other learned persons, may be there who may have

* God always pervades everywhere, all persons, things, incidents,
circumstances and actions etc. Therefore, God-realization need not be left for
the future. He is now, here, in everyone and everyone's. Moreover, He is superior
to all the persons etc. By having this belief, mind will be attracted towards Him
automatically and a burning desire to realize Him immediately will be aroused.

+ Here the striver has been called 'Siddha' (successful one) according to
‘Sati-siitra-nyaya’ because he will attain perfection in the same way as a saree will
be prepared of the Sutra (thread). If a striver depending on God, having exclusive
devotion for Him adores Him in order to realize Him, he will attain perfection,
there is no doubt about it. As far as a saree is concerned it may be prepared out of
the thread or even any other cloth may be prepared out of the thread or the thread
may be destroyed. But the devotee who adores God with exclusive devotion will
certainly attain perfection. :
"
862,"Verse 3] : _ SADHAKA-SANJIVANI. 825
knowledge, but they cannot explain to others. The Lord declares, oe
""One looks upon Him, as a marvel; another, likewise speaks of
Him, as a marvel"" (Gité 2/29). : -
Generally, people give illustrations about this verse, )in order /
to explain, that-it is very difficult to attain, Divine perfection.
But actually, it is not so. In order to attain Divine perfection,
it is difficult to -have keen desire and for the fulfilment of that
desire, it is not easy to have the company of liberated souls. |
Here, Lord Krsna says to Arjuna, ""I shall unfold (teach) to you
in full, this knowledge, combined with realization and you will
know it."" Such an omniscient speaker, as Lord Krsna Himself,
and such an inquisitive striver as Arjuna, are very rare. The fact
is, that it is difficult to have keen desire. By having keen desire, -
a striver has no responsibility of his own, the responsibility is _
shouldered by the Lord.
By using ‘tattvatah’ (In truth), Lord Krsna means that a striver |
comes to know the truth (reality), about Him, that He manifests —
Himself in the form of Lord Siva, Ganeéa, Surya (the sun), Visnu,
by incarnations and He is possessed of form and attributes and -
He is also, without form and attributes i.e., he knows that there
is no existence, in the least, besides the Lord.
Appendix—Out of all the God-realized souls who have
attained perfection after striving, following the disciplines of
Karma, Jiiana and Dhyana etc., the devotees, who know the
entire form of God in reality, in the shape of ‘all is God’ are
very rare, indeed (7/19).
*Yatatamapi siddhanam’—those liberated souls, are dissatisfied
with their state of liberation and from within they have a yearning,
a hunger to have supreme devotion (infinite bliss). Therefore
it is mentioned in the Brahmasutra—‘muktopasrpyavyapadesat’
(1/3/2)—‘that God Who is an embodiment of love (devotion) is
realizable (attainable) even by the liberated souls’. The reason
is that by attaining salvation, the desire for the perishable relish
"
863,"826 §RIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter 7
is wiped out but the hunger for endless relish is not ‘satisfied.
That hunger is aroused by-God’s grace. It means that those,-who

| practise spiritual discipline by having faith and belief in God,
who have the latent impression of devotion, God:does not let -
them be satisfied with knowledge, does not let them stay there,
and makes the relish of salvation insipid for them. ———
A Karmayogi, a Jhanayogi, a Dhyanayog!, etc.,—all can attain
perfection (salvation) but all of them don’t know God in His entire
form. Therefore the expression ‘yatatimapi siddhanam’ means that
by striving, they have attained perfection with their own method
but they don’t know My entire (full) form. The reason is that
My entire form can be known by supreme devotion—‘bhaktya
mamabhijanati yavanyascasmi tattvatah’ (Gita 18/55), -
 ‘Kaécinmarh vetti tattvatah’—Here the term ‘mam’ stands for -
God in his entire form. The entire form of God can be known
by God’s grace, not by thought (Gita 10/11). Arjuna also after
hearing the gospel of the Gita said to Lord Krsna, “By Your
grace my delusion is destroyed and memory is gained”-——‘nasato
mohah smrtirlabdha tvatprasadanmayacyuta’ (Gita 18/73). As ~
while feeding the cow licks her calf with fondness, it provides
so much nourishment which the calf can’t get only by drinking
milk. Similarly the knowledge which is gained by God’s grace,
can’t be gained by thought because while thinking, the entity
of the self persists. |
-_ He who knows only attributeless God, does not know Him
in reality but he who knows both God endowed with attributes
and also attributeless God (entire) knows God in reality.

By Karmayoga ‘quiet bliss’ (peace) (quietude) is attained
because attachment to the world causes disquietude. By Karmayoga
renunciation of attachment to the world causes peace—
‘tyagacchantiranantaram’ (Gita 12/12). By Jnanayoga ‘unbroken
bliss’ is attained. This unbroken bliss is also called ‘self-bliss’
because it is the bliss of the self. In self-bliss the self merges
"
864,"Verse 3} SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 827
into Brahma (Absolute) viz., as Brahma is truth, consciousness
and bliss solidified, similarly the self becomes truth, consciousness
and bliss solidified—‘mama sadharmyamagatah’ (Gita 14/2).
Though having attained the self-bliss (Self-realization) a striver _
lacks nothing, yet the striver, who has the latent impression |
of devotion and depends on God’s grace, is not satisfied with
that self-bliss.* Within him there is hunger for endless bliss.
Therefore by Bhaktiyoga, endless bliss is attained. Self-bliss is
the bliss of the fragment (soul) but endless bliss is the bliss
of the whole (God) (supreme soul). This is the principle that
the pleasure which is caused by the attraction of an object, is
not caused by the knowledge of that object. As the pleasure
which is derived from the greed for money, is not derived
from the mere knowledge of money. By knowing the money
we shall know how to make use of it, but there will not be -
special attraction. ‘Gain more and more money’—this attraction
will persist by being greedy for money. In fact there is no
pleasure in gaining money but it seems because of the evil of
greed, but God’s bliss is because of pure love and this bliss
really exists. The reason is that being a fragment of God, the oe
embodied self has an automatic attraction towards Him. This is
the principle that a fragment is naturally attracted towards the
whole; as a stone being a fragment of the earth when thrown
‘upward naturally 1s attracted towards the earth, fire is naturally
attracted towards the sun (upward)T and rivers naturally flow
towards the sea and so on. |
*He who attains salvation is naturally satisfied, but he who has the
impressions of devotion is not satisfied. The reason is that God showers his special
grace on such a devotee and does not let him stay there. (7/3)
_ [Here a doubt may crop up that the sun does not shine at night, then why
does fire rise upward at night? The clarification is that whether it is day or night,
the sun may shine anywhere but he is always above the earth. Therefore as the
people in India see the sun above the earth, so do the people of America (which
is almost in the opposite direction of India) also see the sun above the earth.
"
865,"828 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
Why do we need God? If we reflect upon it, we come to
| know that there is such a necessity which can’t be satisfied either
by our own self or by the world. In order to alleviate sufferings
and to attain supreme peace, there is no necessity for God. The
reason is that if desires are totally renounced, our sufferings —
will end and Supreme Peace will be attained—‘tyagacchantira-
nantaram’ viz., we shall attain salvation, we have necessity for
God in order to attain Supreme Love because we are fragments
only of God. | |
- The man who wants to be liberated from worldly sufferings,
who wants to be independent, being free from dependence, attains
salvation. But the man, who being tired of the worldly sufferings
thinks, “If there had been anyone my own who would have given -
me refuge in himself, who would have embraced me and who
would have removed my grief, sin, lack, fear and monotony -
etc., attains devotion.” It means that God is not needed to attain
salvation but he is needed to attain devotion. When a man comes
to know that in such a vast world, in endless universes, there
is nothing mine but only He is mine, in Whose one fragment _
endless universes are situated, then he feels the necessity for
God from within. The reason is that only the thing, which ever
stays with us and with which we may ever stay, can be ours.
Only God can be the entity Who may not be separated from us
and from Whom we may not be separated. |
Now the question arises when a man needs God, why is He.
not attained? The answer is that a man lives comfortably without
attaining Him, he forgets his necessity. He remains satisfied with
objects, ability and power etc., which are available to him. If
he realizes the need for God and can be ill at ease, there is no
delay in God-realization. The reason is what should be the delay
in attaining Him Who is ever attained? God is not a tree that
the seed is sown today and it will bear fruit after years. He is
present at all places, all the time, in all things, in all states and
"
866,"Verse 4-5] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 829
in all circumstances the same as He is. We have turned away
from Him, he has not turned away from us.

* The entity which is kaletdoscopic and never remains the same has been
mentioned as perishable (in 15/16), lower (insentient) Nature (in 7/4) and of
twenty-four categories—five subtle elements (ether, air, fire, water and earth), ego,

nature (para prakrti). The lower nature, is inferior, insentient
and changeful, while higher nature is superior, sentient and
changeless. |
Every man's nature, is different. As a man's nature, cannot be
proved to have its own separate entity, independent of that man,
similar is the case with that of God's nature. This nature is God's
own disposition, therefore, it is called as His nature. Similarly,
the embodied soul, being a portion of God, cannot be proved
to have its own separate existence, independent of God, as it is
: God itself: Though God itself, but it is named nature, because
_ Of its affinity with lower nature. As it accepts the activities of
the Lower Nature as its own, or in. other words attributes the
doership to himself, therefore, it is called, superior Nature, or |
embodied soul, otherwise, it is nothing else but God. When it =~
becomes free, from the bondage of being a doer, and an enjoyer
| (Gita 18/17) it is no more higher nature, or embodied soul.
Here the Lower Nature, includes earth, water, fire; air,
ether, mind, intellect and ego. If out of these eight, five gross
elements are supposed to represent the gross creation and the =~
- three, (mind, intellect and ego) are to represent the whole subtle
- creation, then this description of nature, remains incomplete, as
it leaves out the causal creation. To prove that in this description
of nature, all parts of nature, have been included, the venerable
commentators, have interpreted these in the following way.
According to them the five gross elements stand for gross as
well as their causes, five subtle tanmatras, mind stands for its
Origin ego; intellect stands for cosmic intelligence and ‘ego’
_ stands for the causal nature. Thus, this interpretation includes
_ full description, of cosmic nature, as it includes all the three
gross, subtle. and causal creation.
In scriptures, this cosmic nature has been described as prakrti
and vikrti. Here, a point needs attention, that Lord Krsna has not
described lower and higher nature from the view-point, of prakrti
"
868,"Verse 4-5] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 831
and vikrti or Nature-cum its.evolutes. Had the Lord defined so,
He would not have called the individual: soul, as higher nature,
because the soul is neither prakrti—the cause of any evolute nor
vikrti—the evolute itself. The soul is immutable and changeless. It ;
proves, that the Lord, has described matter, as lower nature, and
the individual soul, as higher nature, just in order to distinguish,
the insentient from the sentient. — a ee
_ According to this author, this eightfold division of Nature, |
includes the gross and: subtle, creation only. The five gross
elements enumerated here, include the. gross creation. These five
elements, also represent subtle creation, as these are evolutes of
five subtle tanmatras. Mind, intellect and ego, described here,
are also part of the subtle creation. De -
.. The ego has two aspects. The ego is matter, in its nature, _
and it is a modification, or a.trait of the inner sense @d:%t7),
It is a sort of an instrument. This is called, in the fourth verse,
as ego a. part of lower nature. The second aspect of ego, is
_ one's own personality and it represents itself as a ‘doer’. This
is described, in the fifth verse of this chapter, by the name of 8
higher nature. This ‘ego’, is the result of the soul's identification,
with causal body. _ . |
| This identification, has two aspects—insentient and sentient.
The insentient factor, is the causal body and one who cultivates
egoistic notion, is sentient factor, until Self-realization, this ego
persists assuming itself always, as ‘doer’. During deep sleep, it
lies dormant or is not manifest. After waking up ""I slept soundly
and am awake"", a man making this statement, represents the
ego, the higher-nature. After waking up he thinks, ""where and
how he is"", this is wakefulness. of mind, and when he knows,
that he is at a particular place and time, it is the wakefulness,
of the intellect. Thus, one who experiences his entity, is the ego,
representing higher nature, and through the ego, with which he
experiences, is a trait of the inner sense, it is lower nature.
"
869,"832 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7 |
. When soul, the sustainer and illuminator of this lower
nature—identifies itself, with this nature, it is then called higher
nature, or the embodied soul. This fact, has been described in
Gita by the term‘ aad aria srq’—by whom this insentient Nature,
is sustained. | |
__ If this sentient nature (soul: or spirit), without having: any
inclination for the insentient nature, has an inclination for God
i.e., accepts Him as Its own, it realizes the Self and then its (soul's
or man's) attachment, for the world, turns into love for God.*
This Divine love, is limitless, it is in the form of bliss, and it
increases every moment. After attaining it, nothing else remains
to be attained; and after realizing the Self, nothing remains to
be known and after applying all the objects etc., of the lower
nature for the service of the world, and having disinclination, for _
them, nothing remains, to be done. This is the state of perfection,
of human life. a , | |
'Prakrtirastadha apareyam'—It seems, that this eightfold |
lower nature is individual, lower nature, because a man is bound
because of his affinity for his body. If a man (soul) does not -
accept his affinity for it, there is no question of any bondage.
Man himself (soul or spirit), sustains this universe viz.,.accepts
his relationship with the universe, and that relationship leads
him, to bondage. — SO
An individual body, has no separate entity, different from
the universe. When a man (the self), assumes his affinity for the
body, he is bound. If he does:not assume this affinity, there. is
no question of bondage. =
In the seventh verse of the fifteenth chapter, Lord Krsna
*The striver following the Discipline of Knowledge will have revelation
of love for God in the form of Self-realization while a devotee following the
Discipline of Devotion will have that revelation in the form of Divine love. Thus
from this point of view the striver following the Discipline of Knowledge and
that following the Discipline of Devotion—both become one. |
"
870,"Verse 4-5] SADHAKA-SANIIVANI 833
declares, ""The soul in the body, is an eternal fragment of Myself.""
- But it attracts the mind and the senses, that rest in Matter viz.,
it accepts the mind and the senses as its own. In the same way _
in the fifth verse of the thirteenth chapter, Lord Krsna describes |
the universe as Ksetra (field) and, in the sixth verse, describes its
evolutes (modifications). But actually these evolutes are found,
not in the universe, but in the body. Thus, affinity for the body,
is the main obstacle to emancipation. This body, being a fragment
of the universe, cannot be separated from it. =
The fact is, that primordial Matter, is neither a means nor
an obstacle to emancipation. When a striver does not accept
his. affinity for it, it proves helpful. But, when he accepts his
affinity for it, it proves an obstacle, because this affinity for :
prakrti (matter), gives birth to egoism (Tness). This egoism, is _
the cause of bondage. By the phrase ‘Itiyarn me’, Lord Krsna,
warns us that this Primordial Matter or lower nature, is His. So
a striver should not accept it as his own, otherwise this affinity
will lead him, to the cycle of birth and death. __
_ Inegoism (Tness), there are two desires—desire for pleasure, -
as well as desire for knowledge. The desire for pleasure, can
be wiped out by the Discipline of Action, while the desire for
knowledge can be satisfied by the Discipline of Knowledge.
Thus, a striver who 1s firmly established in either of the two, gets
the fruit of both (Gita 5/4-5) i.e., when the desire for pleasure
is wiped out, the desire for knowledge is satisfied. When the
desire for knowledge is satisfied, the desire for pleasures, is
wiped out. When the desire for pleasures is wiped out, or the
desire for knowledge is satisfied, there develops detachment,
automatically. If a striver does not enjoy that detachment 1.e.,
he is not pleased with that state, he attains Self-realization and
his human life, proves fruitful... |
‘Jivabhitam'—<Actually, the soul is a fragment of God, but
by accepting its affinity for physical, subtle and causal bodies,
"
871,"834 | _ §RIMADBHAGAVADGITA.— [Chapter7
it has become an embodied soul. It accepts its affinity, in order
to, enjoy mundane pleasures, which lead It to great affliction,
in the form of birth and death, © Oo :
""Mahabaho'—O: Arjuna, being mighty-armed, you are very ;
brave and powerful and. you can ‘understand the. difference |

Therefore, understand it. — - Ly : Ss
 ""Yayedarn dharyate jagat'*—In fact, this universe is a. |
manifestation of God i.e., all the universe is God (7/19) and
He is being and non-being both-(9/19).. The man (soul); has
sustained this universe i.e., the. man (soul), by accepting the
free existence of this universe, has started using it for his own
pleasure, and thus it has led him to bondage. If he takes this -
universe, as a manifestation or revelation of God, he will be _
free, from the shackles of birth and death. 7 :
The world, is transitory and kaleidoscopic, but man thinks it
permanent and pleasing, because of his temptation and attachment
for pleasure and things, by having feelings of 'T and 'mine’. It
is because of his attachment for pleasure and prosperity, that 7
he cannot behold this world, as a manifestation of God. As a
debouch cannot behold a woman, as mother, so can a person
having attachment for the worldly pleasure and prosperity, not
perceive that the Lord Himself, has manifested Himself, in the
form of the world. This attachment for pleasure sustains the
universe, i.e., 1s the cause of sustaining, the universe. |
Secondly, all human beings, are born of sperm and ovum,
which themselves are filthy and impure. But a voluptuary thinks,
the body as charming and beautiful, because of his attachment
for pleasure. This thought makes the world.
Once a gentleman said to a saint, who was standing on the
bank of a river, ""Sir, the water of this river and the men, on the
*In the Gita the term ‘Jagat’ (universe) denotes higher Nature (in 7/13),
lower Nature (in 7/5) and higher and lower Nature both (in 7/6).

bridge are flowing.” The saint. said, ""O brother, it is not only
the water of the river, or the men that are moving, but the river -
and the bridge themselves, are also moving."" It means, that all |
of these are moving towards, destruction. One day they will .
come to an end. Actually the whole world.is perishing every — 7
moment. In fact, the soul is neither born nor does It decay. But,
by identifying Itself with the body, It accepts the body's birth and
death as Its own, birth and death. If It does not identify itself |
with the body nor does It accept its affinity for it, this world
will have no existence at all. | |

The term 'Idam', means that as both body.and the world 7
are one, and the same, their difference is not real, it is merely .
assumed. Therefore, Lord Krsna, in the thirteenth chapter, says |
that this body is spoken of. as a field (ksetra) (13/1); but where
there is a description of this field, it is a description of the world 7
(13/5), while the evolutes such as desire, aversion, pleasure and
pain etc., have been described part of the individual body (13/6).
It means, that the world and the body are essentially the same. —
If we accept the body as T’, it gives birth to egoism (‘T'ness),
and if we accept the body as ‘mine’, it gives birth to 'mineness'’, ;
and both of these lead to bondage. If we realize, that the body
and the world belong to one and the same class, and the man
himself (soul) and God belong to one class, which is quite
different from that of the body and the world, egoism (‘T'ness)
and 'mineness' perish’ automatically. These can be wiped out,
by the three Disciplines of Action (2/71), Knowledge ( 18/53)
and Devotion (12/13). It means, that the assumed affinity for
matter, should be broken off and it can be, by accepting reality
through discrimination. : :

A teacher and a pupil have their own separate entity or
existence. But by having love and regard for each other, there.
"
873,"836 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
is a further affinity between the two.* Similarly, the soul which
is a fragment of the Lord, has accepted its affinity, with a body
and the world. It is because of this affinity, that there appears to
be a third entity, which is called Tness. This affinity of ‘T'ness, is
merely assumed, not real. But the soul, by accepting it as real, gets .
into bondage. A teacher and a pupil, have a separate existence,
and both of them accept their affinity for each other. But, out of
the soul (sentient) and the world (insentient or matter), only the
soul has Its own existence. By an error it accepts Its relationship
with the world, which is changing and perishing, every moment.
This assumed relationship, is also decaying every moment. But
it seems real to those, who. want to seek pleasure in the world.
It is because of their attachment for worldly pleasures, that a
world, which is never attained, seems to be attained; while God, /
Who is ever attainable seems unattained to them. As soon as,
they are free from this assumed affinity for the world, they will
realize the reality of their affinity—that they have their affinity
for God; and only He, not the world, can be attained.

To wipe out this feeling of ‘I'ness, a striver should have a
firm belief, that he is different from matter, he should not expect =
anything from the world, but perform actions for the service of
the world, because, whatever strength, intelligence and resources
he possesses, he has received from the world. By following,
this Discipline of Action, the direction of actions and objects,
is towards the world and the self, remains, so he attains self-
realization. By following, the Discipline of Knowledge, also by
using discrimination a striver, by breaking off his affinity for
things and actions, of the world, attains self-realization. Thus,
by breaking off his affinity for matter, he becomes free from his
assumed, ‘T'ness. Devotion to God, is aroused in the Discipline
of Devotion, by accepting 'I am only God's, and only God is

* In teacher-taught relationship the duty of the teacher is to do good to the pupil
and the duty of the pupil is to serve the teacher. In the same way every relationship
of the world is to do good to others or serve others without any selfish motive.

mine, I am not of the body, and the world, and the. body and

the world, are not mine’. Then a striver having disinclination for

the world, depends only on God and thus he becomes free from

the affinity of the world, and egoism ('I'ness).

Thus, by following, the Discipline of Action, the Discipline :

of Knowledge, or the Discipline of Devotion, in the right

perspective, a striver, becomes free from the affinity of matter

and realizes, God.
Appendix—When the self gets identified with the lower nature

viz., is identified with ‘ego’ and assumes itself ‘I am’, then by

becoming an embodied soul, it is called higher nature. On one

side of the ‘ego’ (I), there is the world (lower nature) and on

the other side there is God. But the embodied. soul instead of |

accepting God, accepts His lower nature and sustains it in the form

of the world which leads him to the bondage of birth and death. -
‘apareyamitastvanyam’—Different from ‘apara’ (lower) is

‘para’ (higher) and different from ‘para’ is ‘apara’. ‘Apara’ |

is different viz., belongs to another class. By catching

(sustaining) the alien this ‘para’ has become ‘jiva’ (embodied

soul) —‘jivabhitam’. | | :
Apara (kaleidoscopic) and para (unchangeable)—both are

God’s nature viz., power. Being powers of God, both are

identified with God because without the powerful, the power

has no independent existence. As nail and hair, in spite of being

lifeless, are not different from the living body, similarly the lower

nature, in spite of being insentient, is not different from God—-Who

is sentient—-‘sadasaccahamarjuna’ (Gita 9/19). In this way when

‘apara’ and ‘para’—both prakrtis are the embodiments of God,

then what remains besides God? Nothing remains—‘Vasudevah

sarvam’ (Gita 7/19). .
God’s integral form consists of both para and apara nature

meaning that Para, Apara; Sat, Asat; sentient and insentient all

are God. .
"
875,"838 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA {Chapter7
“Yayedarmh dharyate jagat’. means that this world has no
existence in the eye of God as well as in the eye of an exalted
soul. It exists only in the eye of the individual soul. In the
eye of God ‘Sat’ and ‘Asat’ all is He Himself aaqrareasa
(Gita 9/19) and in the eye of the exalted soul “All is God”
“aged: aay (Gita 7/19). : ee
A man (the embodied soul) because of attachment and |
aversion has sustained the world in his intellect. The same
fact has been pointed out in the seventh verse of the fifteenth
chapter by the expression ‘manah sasthanindriyani prakrtisthani
karsati’. By cognising the existence of the world, attachment
and aversion arise. | : : : oe
The embodied self assumed the existence of the world and .
attached importance to it. By attaching importance, the desire _
for pleasure sprang up which 1n its turn led it to the cycle of -
birth and death. It means that by assuming any other entity
besides God, the being has been snared in the worldly bondage.
Therefore it is the being’s responsibility not to assume any other
entity besides God. If it does not assume the entity of the world,
where is the world? | |
The Lord declares that earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind,
intellect, ego—-these eight constitute ‘apara’ (insentient) prakrti.*
As the earth is insentient and is to be known, so is ego insentient
and is to be known. It means that earth, water etc.—all the
eight belong to the same ‘jati’ viz., class (category)}. Therefore
* If there is one thing common in several things, that is called ‘jati’. Earth,
water, fire, air, ether, mind, intellect and ego—in these eight there is oneness
of ‘jati’ (class) but there is not oneness of form viz., in spite of one class, their
forms are different. Therefore it has been called ‘astadha’ (eightfold). Being the
evolutes of ‘apara prakrti’ (lower nature), here earth, water etc., have been called
‘apara prakrti’. :
+ Earth is gross. Water is more subtle than earth. Fire is more subtle than
water. Airis more subtle than fire. Ether is more subtle than air. Mind is more subtle
than ether. Intellect is more subtle than mind. Ego is more subtle than intellect.
"
876,"Verse 4-5] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI | 839
the class to which the earth belongs, ego also belongs to the
same class viz., ego like a clod is insentient and is objective in
nature. Therefore the Lord has mentioned ‘ego’ as ‘this’—‘etad
yo vetti’ (Gita 13/1). ‘Etat’ (this) is never “aham’ (I). Therefore -
the Lord by saying ‘ego’ as ‘this’ means that ‘ego’ is not ‘the |
self’. When the sentient (self) identifies itself with ‘ego’, then
it gets bound—’ahamhkara vimidhatma kartahamiti manyate’
(Gita 3/27). This is called ‘cijjadagranthi’. 7
‘Ahankara itiyarhn me’—the pure ego is matter (insentient) in
its nature and belongs to the ‘apara prakrti’ (lower nature) but ‘I
am’—this identified ego is not only of ‘apara prakrti’ but it is
conjoined with ‘para prakrti’ (sentient). On Self-realization the
latter ego, which leads to birth and death, does not persist but
the former (ego of apara prakrti) remains. _
‘Actions and objects are neither in ‘para prakrti’ nor
in God but they are in ‘apara prakrti’. “Apara prakrti’ is in
the form of actions and objects. The Lord with the help of
‘Prakrti’? brings into being the whole creation. ‘Para prakrti’
viz., the embodied soul, by being attached to actions and objects -
(Apara prakrti) and depending on them, gets bound. Attachment
to the “Apara prakrti’ and dependence on it means ‘to sustain
the world’. Therefore the Lord at the very. beginning of the
seventh chapter has mentioned—to be attached to Him and to
take refuge in Him by the expression—‘*mayyasaktamanah partha
yogam yunjanmadasrayah’. If a striver (the embodied soul) is
not attached to ‘Apara prakrti’ and does not take refuge in it; he
will attain salvation. If he is attached to (loves) God and takes
refuge in him, he will become a ‘Bhakta’ (devotee).
The world has no independent existence. The soul has
cognised the existence of the world which leads it to bondage.
The soul sustains the world which causes pleasure, pain, bondage
In apara prakrti ego is the most subtle. Thus the Lord has described apara prakrti
from the gross to the subtle in due order.

and leads it to the eighty-four lac forms of life, to the life of

cause any obstacle but attachment to the modes carries it to the _
higher regions or middle regions or lower regions—‘karanarh
gunasango’ sya sadasadyonijanmasu’ (Gita 13/21). The soul itself
gets attached to the modes. Apara prakrti does not get attached
to anyone. Neither Prakrti nor modes, nor senses; nor mind nor
intellect gets attached. But the embodied soul itself gets attached
and thus it feels pleasure and pain and follows the cycle of birth
and death. The soul is independent because it is ‘para’ viz., the
higher nature. The poor apara prakrti does nothing because it is
insentient and is free from desire. The being getting attached to.
it and making proper use or misuse of it, goes to high (good)
and low (evil) wombs and goes astray. It means that the being __
in spite of being unchangeable, being attached to the changeable
world, becomes the kaleidoscopic world (embodied soul)*
(Gita 7/13). It has an eye on the: body only, it. does not even
think of its divine nature. oe
The self identifies itself with the world viz., with the body,
senses, mind, intellect, ego which is altogether different from
it—-this is sustenance of the world. In fact the world is not
ours, because if we had attained the thing which is ours, our
desires would have ended forever and we would have been free
from mineness, fear, worries and desires. But the world can’t
afford us such a thing which is ours viz., of which there is
never any disunion. The entity which is ours, can’t be attained
by the world but can be attained by renouncing attachment to
the world. Our thing (entity) is God. We are the fragments of
that God—‘mamaivarnso jivaloke’ (Gita 15/7). The method
to attain Him (from the view-point of Karmayoga) is that the
objects (body etc.,) recerved from the world, should be used to
* Here the term ‘Jagat’ stands for the ‘changeable’—‘gacchatiti jagat’.
"
878,"Verse 4-5] SADHAKA-SANJIVANI 841
render service to the world without desiring any fruit. A striver
should not be attached to any action or object. It is better not
to harm anyone than to serve them. If we don’t harm anyone
and do not do evil to others, service will be naturally rendered .
to them, we shall have not to render it.* We are not proud of
the action which takes place itself and there is no desire for its :
fruit. Having renounced pride and the desire for fruit we attain
the thing which is really ours. | | |
In fact ‘apara prakrti’ has no separate existence at all
besides God—‘nasato vidyate bhivah’. The individual self has
cognised its (apara prakrti’s) special existence. As money has no
importance of its own but we attach importance to it because
of our greed for it. We are attracted towards the object to a
which we attach importance. We attach importance, when we
accept evil i.e., some faultsT. It is due to the evil of lust for ~
sex, there is attraction for woman; because of the evil of greed
there is attraction for money; because of the evil of delusion,
there is attraction for family and so on, But when we identify
ourselves with those evils, we don’t perceive those evils as
evils and we don’t know that we, by assuming their (apara -
prakrti’s) existence, are attaching importance to them. When
this identification is wiped out, evils stay no more in us and
* If we don’t do evil to others, there will be two things—either we shall do
nothing, or if we do, only service will be rendered. By doing nothing and by serving
others—by these two things, attachment to the world is renounced. The reason is
that by doing nothing, no evil is done and by the service which is rendered itself
to others all evils are wiped out. As while eating food a man holds ‘I eat’—thus
the pride which is attached is not attached in the digestion of food because food
is digested itself. Similarly when service is rendered itself, the pride of doership
and attachment to the fruit of action, are naturally renounced.
TAll the worldly pleasures are born of evils. When we accept evils, they
seem to provide pleasure. Because of the lust for sex a man can’t live without
woman. Because of greed a man can’t live without wealth. Because of delusion
a man can’t live without family. It is because of evils that a man can’t perceive
the value of renunciation.

‘apara’. But he who sees, hears, studies, thinks, knows, assumes __ -

inseparable from God viz., they are the manifestations of God. __
Therefore in the inside and outside of endless universes and
in the form of infinite universes, there is nothing else. besides
God—‘vasudevah sarvam’ (7/19), ‘sadasaccahamarjuna’ (9/19).
All the philosophies and diverse opinions of the world have been ;
propounded .by-their heads (acaryas) but “Vasudevah sarvam’ is
not the philosophy or opinion of a particular ‘acarya’ (head) but
it is the irreversible principle of Lord Krsna within which all
philosophies and diverse opinions are included. 7
_. The individual self has assumed the independent existence
of :the . ‘apara’  (world)-—‘yayedath ‘dharyate jagat’. ‘Apara’ is
God’s but this self is bound because it has assumed ‘apara’ viz..,
body-senses-mind-intellect-ego its own and for itself. Therefore
if a striver perceives (sees) the world, it is his personal view.
The personal view is not a principle. Whatever is seen is limited
while the ‘Reality’ is limitless. As the sun appears like a metallic
dish, but actually it is not of the size of a metallic dish but it is
several times bigger than the earth. Oo 7
If the world is in cognizance of a striver, he should serve

it in a disinterested manner. The assumption that the world is
his and for him-and also. the tendency to derive pleasure out :
of it, is anti spiritual discipline and is the cause of bondage.
The reason is.that the body-senses-mind-intellect etc., whatever
we have, 1s of the world and for the world. Therefore if the
things received from the world, are used in rendering service |
to the world, the world will not appear as the world but it
will be seen as the manifestation of God, which really it. is.
It means whether a striver assumes the world as true or the
self as true or God as true, by anyone of the assumptions, |
he can practise spiritual discipline and can attain the final
reality ‘Vasudevah sarvam’. |

'Etadyonini bhitani’'—All the beings—gods, men, animals,
birds etc., which move and also trees, creepers and grass etc.,
which do not move, have their origin, in the union of My
insentient and sentient Nature.
In the twenty-sixth verse of the thirteenth chapter also, the
Lord declares, ""Whatever being, moving or unmoving is bom;
know that, as emanated from the union of Ksetra (matter) and
"
881,"844 SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA [Chapter7
Ksetrajna (spirit)."" The same fact has been pointed out, in the
fourth verse of the fourteenth chapter, when He declares, ""My
prakrti (nature) (primordial matter), is the womb of the bodies

of creatures and the soul (seed), which resides in those bodies, __
is My fragment."" The same seed or soul, has been called His |
higher (sentient) Nature (7/5), and His eternal portion (15/7).

‘Sarvanityupadharaya'—In the universe all the moving and |
unmoving creatures, are born of the union of the sentient and the
insentient nature (matter). It means, that soul has accepted matter,
as its own, and keeps its company, and so beings are born—So
think of this fact i.e., understand it in the right perspective, or
accept it. |

‘Aham krtsnasya jagatah prabhavah - pralayastatha'—All
objects emanate from God, and again dissolve in Him. So the —
Lord declares, ""I am the origin of the entire creation, and again
it dissolves in Me."" |

The Lord, is the source of entire creation because, creation
comes into existence, by His will* (Chandogya. 6/2/3). As a
potter, makes earthenwares and a goldsmith makes ormaments -
of gold, so does the Lord create this world. Thus, like a potter
and a goldsmith, He is an efficient cause, of this world.

The universe, again dissolves in Him. As an earthen vessel

_ is of clay, it was clay in the past, before it was moulded into
this shape and will remain clay, when the vessel is broken into
pieces. Similarly, the creation is born of the Lord, resides in Him
and merges (dissolves) in Him. Thus, he is the material cause
of this creation. This is knowledge. The realization, that in the
world there is nothing besides the manifestation of the Lord, is
Vijiiana (real knowledge of Manifest Divinity).

*There is a fact which needs attention that only Ksetrajfia (spirit), not
Ksetra (Matter) has accepted this affinity. If it does not accept this affinity, it can't |
be reborn because, ""Attachment to these Gunas (modes) is the cause of his birth
in good and evil wombs"" (13/21). |
"
882,"Verse 6] SADHAKA-SANIJIVANI 845

In the expression 'Krtsnasya jagatah', Lord Krsna declares.
Himself to be the origin of entire creation, and also its dissolution.
Here it is appropriate for Him, to talk of Himself as the origin
and dissolution of Matter (insentient Nature). But how is the :
origin of soul (sentient or higher nature) and its dissolution,
possible? The soul is eternal, omnipresent, immovable, constant
and everlasting (Gita 2/24), while the world is ever-changing. But, .
here the word ‘creation’ denotes, both the lower nature (matter)
and higher nature (Soul). The reason is, though the soul is eternal,
changeless and constant, yet It identifies Itself with perishable
matter and thus accepts its (insentient's) creation and dissolution
as Its (sentient's) own creation and dissolution. So, the soul is ;
said to be born and decayed. Therefore, Lord Krsna, has declared .
Himself to be the origin of the entire creation and also its end. ~
Thus, within creation, (i.e.,) all the moving, unmoving; sentient, |
insentient beings, will be included. Moreover, Lord Krsna, in
the thirteenth verse of this chapter, declares, ""The whole of this
creation, being deluded by objects evolved from the three modes
of nature, does not know Me.” Only the sentient can know Him. ;
Therefore the term ""Jagat"" (universe), includes both matter (the
insentient), as well as soul (the sentient).

In the eighth verse of the sixteenth chapter, according to men
of demoniacal traits, the universe includes both insentient and
sentient beings, because they accept all beings, not only insentient
ones, as unreal. If the term ‘Jagat’ (universe), is interpreted as
only matter, the followers of non-dualistic principles, who accept _
the universe as unreal, untrue and baseless, will be included,
among men of demoniacal traits, which is totally improper and
unjustified. Similarly, in the twenty-sixth verse of the eighth
chapter, there is description of the two paths, the bright and the
darkness of the world. But the paths, can be followed by the
sentient only. The sentient, by identifying with matter, is called
‘Jagat’ (world or universe). _
"
883,"846 . SRIMADBHAGAVADGITA ‘({Chapter7
_.. Thus, we conclude that soul by identifying Itself with
Matter, is called embodied soul (world or universe). But, when |
having disinclination for Matter, it realizes its identity, with pure
consciousness (God), this individual soul becomes, the Cosmic
Soul. Such a person is called a Yogi. | |
Appendix—The ‘Apara prakrti’ is that which may know neither
(to) itself nor others. The ‘Para Prakrti’.1s that which may know
itself and also others. All beings moving and unmoving are born
by. the union of the two—apara and para (Gita 13/26).

this evil is wiped out, all evils will be wiped out. Similarly .
_ the basic virtue is also one which reveals all virtues and that -
is—attachment to God. |
We may assume ‘apara’ eternal or transient but our relationship
with it is transient-—this is a unanimous fact. This attachment to
this apara is the cause of birth and death—‘karanarh gunasango’sya

“I am the origin of the entire creation and again it dissolves
in Me—It means that I create this moving-unmoving world and

‘because besides Me there is no other cause or effect of this
world (Gita 7/7) viz., Iam its instrumental cause and I am its
material cause. Therefore I have manifested Myself in the form
